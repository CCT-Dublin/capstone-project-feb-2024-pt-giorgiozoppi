216,Homerun Hotel,What a wonderful stay!  The hotel itself is beautifully designed and pleasant to be in. The location is ideal.  Our room was magnificent.  Spotlessly clean and the staff were extraordinarily accommodating and kind. Delia's (the chef) breakfasts were absolutely delicious and we felt so taken care of...like being at home.  The manager was so helpful in providing us with options and ideas to explore the city.  Dublin is not to be missed...and neither is this hotel!,5,2024,10,17
216,Best place to stay in Dublin!!,"An absolute gem of a place!!.. inviting, clean and gorgeous! The Staff were welcoming and incredibly helpful in giving advice and helping us plan our day. Our room was in the older Georgian part of the Hotel and was gorgeous! Roomy and so cool! ..The highlight of our stay at Number 31 WAS THE MOST OUTSTANDING HOME-COOKED BREAKFASTS each morning. FANTASTIC.. don’t miss the Porridge..!  5 stars all around.",5,2024,10,16
216,Wonderful stay,"We have stayed at Number 31 over the past many years.  We love the location, rooms and staff.  We especially like the breakfast that is served.  Delia does a wonderful job with all of the great offerings, especially her porridge which is the best we have ever had!

During our recent visit it was so great to see her and be able to give her a hug!

We will surely be back.",5,2024,10,14
216,Perfection,"Absolute perfection. The breakfast staff could not have been more obliging. We were under time pressure and were looked after especially speedily. The entire experience was wonderful, from the reception staff to the earthy luxury of the bedroom and the outstanding breakfast service. Bravo, number 31!",5,2024,10,13
216,Dated style seems charming to some,"Let’s start with the good things: outstanding and helpful employees, a delightful cooked-to-order breakfast, quiet neighborhood. Beautiful garden with a fire pit (if you can ever go outside in Dublin). We had room 19, one of the deluxe rooms in the historic building. Because of historic designation, there is no ventilation in the room other than opening a window, so keep that it mind if you like AC.  Our room was decorated in a dated and cluttered art deco style that made us feel like we were sleeping in Grandma’s attic. (Have you ever dreamed of a hotel room with a headless dressmaker’s dummy in the corner dressed in a sequined flapper gown? I am not making this up.)  The marble tiles in our bathroom were stained and degraded, the towel rack falling off the wall. Other reviewers found the charm, but we couldn’t.",3,2024,10,12
216,Well worth the splurge!,"Number 31 was our home away from home for the eight days my daughter and I spent in Dublin celebrating her 36th birthday. We couldn't have asked for better accommodations.
--Perfect location: far enough away from the crowded center to be quiet, and yet just a 5-10 minute walk through St Stephens Green to Grafton St when we were ready to brave the throng. Bus stops for everywhere we wanted to go a minute's walk out the front door.
--Lovely staff: from the friendly, helpful reception folks to the charming servers in the breakfast room--who actually remembered our orders from morning to morning--everyone made us feel more like family than customers. (BTW, do not fail to drag yourself out of bed for that breakfast! You won't be sorry.)
--Quiet, comfortable room with just enough of the eccentricities of a historic building to let us know we were not having the dreaded impersonal chain-hotel experience. (That said, it might be time to replace the king-size mattress in the All That Jazz room. Pretty deep troughs on both sides.)
 We're folks of modest means, so staying at 31 was a splurge for us--but I consider it money well spent. It elevated our visit to Dublin from great to fantastic.",5,2024,10,12
216,Ideal Place for a Dublin vacation - plus Delia!,"Number 31 was the perfect place for us to stay on our first Ireland trip! Stylish, cozy, in the ideal Dublin neighborhood both quiet yet walkable to every place we wanted to go. The biggest highlight, however, was/is the amazing Delia and her delicious breakfast!  We would/will come back to enjoy this wonderful gem.",5,2024,10,11
216,4 nights at Number 31,"We loved our stay at Number 31. The location is great for walking to EPIC, Trinity College, Temple Bar, GPO. We only took a cab to Guinness and the Botanical Gardens.  
The breakfasts were incredible! So many delicious choices. We enjoyed the fire pit several evenings as well as the honor bar. Comfortable beds and helpful staff.",5,2024,10,07
216,Hidden Gem,"Fantastic stay, sanctuary in the city. Room was cosy and bed (king) was very comfortable, no problem sleeping. Fantastic breakfast set the day for sightseeing. Staff are excellent and always helpful. Nice to have this Dublin oasis for our future stays.",5,2024,10,04
216,Sadly underwhelmed,"Our room was very small and stuffy - not enough storage space and we could hear conversations and phones ringing at Reception (which woke me up one night at 1am). Despite going out for 5 1/2 hours our room was not serviced by 3pm when we returned - consequently we had to ask for new towels and ran out of toilet roll/bins were full and not even an apology, just ‘we clean check in rooms first’.  Also not very central for what we wanted to do so we spent a fortune on taxis.  Altogether very disappointing and overpriced given all the rave reviews.",3,2024,09,26
216,Absolutely fabulous hotel,"This is such stylish unique hotel.  I feel lucky to have found it.  The location was perfect, the hotel itself was beautiful. The rooms were comfortable and very stylish.  I can’t say enough about how helpful and friendly the folks that worked there were. The breakfast was unbelievably.  I highly recommend.",5,2024,09,26
216,Great three night stay,"Once again our stay at No. 31 was amazing. Friendly staff, yummy breakfasts, great housekeeping and a wonderful room. All staff, especially Mia and Delia, really welcoming. Can't recommend it highly enough. We'll be returning next year.",5,2024,09,24
216,They deserve the great reviews,"We booked in February for our September stay of 4 nights.  We had a plush double in the Georgian building.  Mia actually took the time to show us 3 room options and we chose the English basement in order to minimize steps.  It was spacious and the bath room was modern.  We needed heat one night but the other nights, slept with open windows and a fan.

Staff are very friendly.  The furnishings are very tasteful.  Breakfast was superior.  The sunken lounge is very charming.

In addition, this location is excellent..in a very posh South Dublin neighborhood near parks and beautiful Georgian Homes.  You can easily walk to Trinity College and O’Connell street. Top restaurants are less than 15 minute walk in very safe and well lit streets. For farther locations, the city bus is very frequent and right across the street.

It is tucked away such that one local taxi driver only knew the street but not the alley where the door is to enter but the taxi from the airport was direct to the front door.

Our reviews of restaurants and sites are posted..two to do tips are 14 Henrietta Street and the free walking tour.  We also easily took the train to Belfast for the day.

Stay here..in fact work your schedule around availability…you will be very happy you chose this gem.",5,2024,09,21
216,Highly recommended,Just got back from a wonderful two night stay. A period property in a gentrified area of town that has some modern touches. Beautiful and the staff were lovely and nothing too much trouble. Special thanks to the Delia who runs the kitchen who made sure we got our breakfast before our early morning flight today. Highly recommended.,5,2024,09,21
216,Not Great … not even close,"Very mediocre for such a well-rated and expensive hotel. No facial tissue in the room, daily housekeeping consisted only of making the bed and providing towels - they didn’t clean up anything on the desk or nightstands. 

They ran out of coffee pods for the in-room machine. When we asked for more on the first day of our stay, we were told to just come to the lobby any time we wanted coffee. Still no pods on the second day. 

I expect a lot more from a place that is in this price range. I can’t recommend that anyone book here.",3,2024,09,07
216,First trip to Ireland,"The bedrooms are so comfortable. The staff is so accommodating, and the food is amazing. We loved walking the grounds. The shop was a great place to buy wool blankets. Very helpful with shipping my purchases home to the States. My husband and I had an absolutely fabulous time, our group went to the cooking school and made dinner. It was delicious.!",5,2024,09,05
216,Wonderful place to stay!!,"We had a wonderful time at Number 31.  We arrived before others checked out and were offered breakfast (it was delicious and cannot decide what to recommend because it was all amazing), the waiting area was so comfortable some of us fell asleep. The entire staff from food service to cleaning were friendly, kind and happy. Everyone here is very accommodating. The rooms were extremely clean (which in our opinion is rare when traveling), You can walk everywhere from our location and the dining places that were recommended were fantastic. We have to give a special shout out to the manager here! He is so kind, friendly and one of the hardest working people we have ever met. Thank you for such a wonderful experience. We will be back the next time we are in Dublin!",5,2024,09,02
216,Wonderful food and staff,"The staff was wonderful, always assisted, and the breakfast and dining staff are both better than anywhere else I’ve ever stayed. Section of food for vegetarian and vegan was especially important and I like the fact that they paid attention to sustainability, comfort and offering a wonderful quiet and beautifully kept hotel.",5,2024,08,27
216,Loved it!,"We loved every single thing about Number 31. Everyone that worked there was so friendly and helpful, and the place is unique and beautiful. We had two rooms with small enclosed patios, very comfortable beds and great decor. Breakfast was a treat, location was central but yet out of the fray. We stayed three nights.",5,2024,08,20
216,Pick it for the location. Love it for the ambience and breakfast!,"This property was a hidden gem within walking distance to the historic center and many sites. Our late night strolls back to the hotel also felt safe and easy.  The room was cozy and clean with a beautiful view to the garden and a comfortable bed and pillows. The shower was great and the thoughtful details like umbrellas at the ready, an honor bar, beautiful art collection and inviting sitting areas both inside and outside made you want to linger and relax. The staff was helpful, friendly and knowledgeable. I also have to comment that the breakfast was truly phenomenal and carried us through the day all the way to dinner!  We stayed four nights, I had four different breakfasts, and we enjoyed every minute of our stay.",5,2024,08,19
216,Beautiful building with the best breakfasts included!,"Number 31 is an amazing place to stay! It's a remodeled Georgian building plus a more mid-century style building, connected by a courtyard. Delia (who is an absolute gem!) makes the best breakfasts in the ENTIRE WORLD. So so good. I cannot recommend Number 31 highly enough!",5,2024,08,19
216,Best Hotel in Dublin!,"Number 31 in Dublin is an absolute gem! From the moment we arrived, we were enchanted by its blend of stylish elegance and warm hospitality. The rooms are beautifully designed, with every comfort in mind, and the breakfast—wow! A delicious start to each day with fresh, local ingredients. The location is perfect, offering a quiet retreat while still being close to the heart of Dublin. The staff goes above and beyond to ensure a memorable stay. Truly the best hotel experience in Dublin! Highly recommend!",5,2024,08,18
216,A few days in Dublin,"Number 31 was excellent. It is in a very quiet  location, but less than 10 minutes walk to St. Stephen's Green. It was very clean, and the staff very helpful. We read that you would have to carry your luggage up the stairs, but the staff did that for us before we could even reach for our bags. Our room, and the shower were small (an ""Intimate room""), however it was not an issue for us. The bed was very comfortable, the room clean, and very quiet. The breakfast was excellent. The only (minor) problem for us was that the room was very warm. They did provide a Dyson fan which made us comfortable. When it was time to leave, there was a bus stop about 3 minutes walk towards St. Stephen's Green that took us to the airport for 9 Euros each .",5,2024,08,09
216,Overall excellent but needs some upgrades,"Interesting and comfortable property. Fabulous breakfasts. No AC like much of Europe meant uncomfortably hot some days. Fan was inadequate. Prior decor in townhouse part interesting but greatly faded and worn, needs to be refurbished. Excellent location with short walks to many attractions. Gaining entrance on arrival a problem because correct buzzer difficult to locate. This can and must be fixed immediately. New owner. If upgrades done would be 4.5 star but AC needed for true 5 star.",4,2024,08,08
216,Hidden gem boutique hotel,"This boutique hotel in a quiet neighborhood was wonderful! A breakfast not to be missed and friendly, attractive staff! Lovely park , dining and shopping a quick walk nearby. Big, well appointed room and new bathroom well done. The outdoor garden and firepit was so nice to enjoy with their honor bar!",4,2024,08,05
216,Amazing experience,"What an amazing place to stay !! Room was beautiful & bed so comfy. Staff are really nice and couldn't do enough for us and what can I say about breakfast, other than wow!! Deliha is just the best cook and so friendly, it was my birthday and she went above & beyond to make it extra special, we will definitely come back & stay 💚",5,2024,08,04
216,The Best Breakfast ever!!,Highly recommend Number 31. The staff are so helpful the room beautiful and my husband reckons it was the best breakfast he ever had. I have to agree. Location also excellent will most definitely be back!!  The only disadvantage is the parking limited spaces but we were lucky got paring just across from number 31 as the offices were closed for the weekend.,5,2024,07,30
216,Beautiful building- tiny room!,"Staff was very friendly and helpful, excellent breakfast, able to walk to many restaurants and attractions. Some things to consider- We had the intimate double room which is quite small for 2 people.  Bathroom was tiny- shower was so small you could barely stand or turn around.  There is no lift, and we were on the top floor of a beautiful restored building i.e. many stairs!  Other than that, it was a lovely stay.",4,2024,07,29
216,Great 1 night stay in the city center,Beautifully decorated Georgian townhome with very comfortable room.  The private garden is well-appointed for enjoying the summer weather. Great location and very nice staff.  We chose the option that included breakfast in the morning and would highly recommend.,5,2024,07,29
216,"Great clean, modern hotel",Lovely modern and clean hotel. Breakfast was delicious and we Enjoyed the complimentary G & T at check in! It’s about a 10-15 minute walk from grafton street in a quiet neighbourhood. If you don’t mind walking a little to the centre of town I would definitely recommend.,5,2024,07,29
216,A gem in Dublin with a heart of gold.,"The heart and soul of this lovely small hotel is Delia who starts your day off right with a fantastic breakfast, nourishing to body and soul, and genuinely warm hospitality.  We greatly appreciated her morning greetings and suggestions for learning as much as we could, while in Dublin, about Irish history and culture.

The other staff (in the kitchen, and throughout the hotel) were helpful and professional. But Delia's outsized talents in the kitchen, and her obvious success in modeling (for these younger staff) what it means to make guests comfortable and cared for, surpass all reasonable expectation.

As to the rest of the hotel- comprising two vintage buildings separated by a charming and pleasant courtyard- we found it comfortable and entirely suited to our needs.  The rooms vary in styling (one building has a vintage jazz-club theme, whereas the other has a more modern sleek decor) and size.  Be aware that accessing most rooms requires ascending and/or descending steps (fine for the octogenarians in our party, especially given the staff's repeated offers to help with luggage); but the physical layout could prove challenging for those less spry or wheelchair-bound).

The Hotel's setting we found quite perfect: a short walk to Saint Stephen's Green and the shopping, museums, and theater in the heart of Dublin, but quiet enough to sleep peacefully with the windows open.",5,2024,07,28
216,Nice Hotel with a hidden gem in the kitchen,"The hotel ambassador should be Delia in the kitchen. I became sick while traveling and her care and concern for my health was touching. She made sure that I had all I needed to help me feel better. Her breakfast menu is outstanding. You will enjoy starting your day with her lovely selections.  She is the epitome of Irish charm!

The front staff is friendly and will answer all questions. They are helpful and professional. 

The hotel is very nice. I gave it a 4 because our room was very dark and a bit crowded with oversized chairs. However, it was clean with nice linens. Housekeeping was average. They forgot something almost every day ie washcloths, hand towels, water, coffee, etc. There was no problem asking for replacements and the front desk was prompt.",4,2024,07,23
216,Lives up to excellent reviews!,"We booked No 31 for a last minute night in Dublin based on the excellent  reviews and website. The stay lived up to expectations, such a friendly staff welcome and care during stay, beautiful surroundings - both the townhouse and Sam’s home, gorgeous room and as for Delia’s breakfast - one of the best we have had! Highly recommend! Just a 10 min stroll also from the iconic Shelbourne Hotel where you can have a fabulous meal in No 27 for a very reasonable price!",5,2024,07,21
216,Our Dublin Go-to Stay,"This was our second stay in as many years and my wife and I  are again in love with this exquisite place. Passing through the ivy shrouded main gate transports you from the city rush to the welcoming sanctuary of Number 31. The staff welcome you like an old friend and kindly acquaint you to your accommodations, room and commons. The recessed lounge and honor bar felt like our own living room, especially with our recent room being Sam’s just five steps away. The rooms are creatively designed and appointed and very comfortable after busy days exploring Dublin. 

All this would be enough but we need to say a few words about Delia. Breakfast is absolutely NOT to be missed, and I cannot express in words the sensory experience it has been every time. The full Irish breakfast is a masterpiece, which each element prepared just right - hearty and flavorful and yet remains light enough to propel you through your day. French press coffee, fresh fruit and yogurt, and house baked bread and preserves - the marmalade is all-world goodness. And Delia is an amazing and kind host who will go out of her way to accommodate guests in her dining room. I have been dreaming of the Irish full for a year, and it was exactly the same level of incredible this time as it was the first. I cannot wait until I am back yet again to enjoy another stay in the near future, and will send all of my friends and family to Number 31 that are planning a visit to Dublin.",5,2024,07,19
216,A unique place,"What an interesting place! Decor was modern but not the sterile feel that you get in some European hotels. Very comfortable large bed. Excellent breakfast - they were willing to serve us a bit early so we could make our flight. Staff was very helpful - they recommended some excellent restaurants and booked us cabs.  Our only concern was that the layout of the bathroom was a bit weird. The towel warmer was at the opposite end of the long room from the shower, so to had to either forego a warm towel or risk walking with wet feet across a very slippery floor of polished tiles. And there was a step up just after you entered; easy to trip on in the middle of the night.",5,2024,07,12
216,hidden gem,"Lovely place , fantastic atmosphere and the staff it's very pleasant. 
we got at the hotel with no reservation , we thought that we booked the hotel to b.com but we never did .The staff was nice and gave us a room and the manager Mehi gave us a discounted rate plus breakfast. Our room was lovely and in the evening we decided to book an extra night with Gustaf .

Thank you for your hospitality and we will recommend to all our friends .",5,2024,07,08
216,Nice Hotel in a great neighorhood,"My wife and I stayed at Number 31 for three nights in early June.  Overall, the hotel was nice and the location was great!  We walked through St Stephens Green at least twice each day and enjoyed the beautiful flowers and peaceful atmosphere.  As many have commented, the breakfast was terrific! One thing we didn’t know about Number 31 is that there are two sections.  The main entrance is where the front desk is located, there are some rooms, and breakfast is served.  There’s also a common sitting area with a fireplace which was nice and an honor bar.  However, there is another area which is housed in Georgian townhouses reachable by walking through the outdoor sitting area.  We didn’t visit it but it looks really nice from the outside.  Our room, #11, is in the main building (front deck part of hotel).  It had a nice terrace with a table and chairs.  However, Irish law doesn’t permit electrical outlets in the bathroom and the only area with a mirror doesn’t have an outlet nearby so it was difficult for my wife to dry her hair.  My wife asked two different people at the front desk how she was supposed to dry her hair and they both said “I don’t know”.  We thought it odd and when we stayed in other hotels in Ireland, they had solutions: one had an extension cord and the other had a mirror with an outlet next to it. Problem solved.  All things considered we enjoyed our stay at Number 31.",4,2024,07,08
216,Oasis in city,"My wife, adult daughter and I recently spent an evening at 31 and wished it could have been for longer. What an oasis within the heart of the city. The room was spacious & well decorated, with more than enough room for the 3 of us. The inner courtyard between the 2 buildings is calm and inviting -- you'd never know the busy city streets were close by. Staff super helpful & accommodating. We'd stay here again for sure....highly recommended!",5,2024,07,07
216,Avoid at all costs,"We booked to stay in number31 with booking.com we were going to a concert the payment in full come out of our bank two days before. When we arrived the girl on reception could not find our booking she called over her manager a most unhelpful person he continued to look for the booking we asked if he had a room to which he replied no I showed them the confirmation email I had to ask him to contact booking.com 
I got through to customer service and they told me this hotel had not undated their calendar and it was their fault after 45 minutes their was no solution and no apologies either we had to leave and managed to book a room in the Iveagh garden hotel that I would highly recommend we had to pay again and now have to try to get a refund on number 31 
All caused by incompetence this actually ruined our trip as we missed the Ireland rugby game as a result. I really would like somebody other than that manager to contact me regarding this situation because it was not acceptable",1,2024,07,07
216,A great stay at Number 31,"Wonderfully located hotel in Dublin. The neighborhood is quiet and safe, the staff is friendly and helpful and the rooms have everything needed for an enjoyable stay. Loved the honor bar and beautiful courtyard. 

The true standout of Number 31 is the included breakfast and Delia’s. Upon being seated you are provided a good sized bowl of fresh fruit, assorted breads and choice of coffee, tea, juices, etc. Then you can order any number of other breakfast items from the menu. 

We only experienced a couple of small issues. One was the shower water temperature would vary a lot while in the shower. We would set it to a comfortable temperature but at some point it would get very hot to near scalding. The other issue is the room we were assigned was on the top floor requiring us to navigate 6 long flights of stairs. We are in our 60’s so it wasn’t an insurmountable challenge but it wasn’t ideal. Having said that I do appreciate that there was no noise above us as there may have been had we been on a lower floor.",5,2024,06,30
216,Amazing stay and close to the city center,"I’ve just come home from a 2 night stay here and it was just incredible from the start. We had our bags taken up to our room while we were checking in, which was greatly appreciated. To note, there are a lot of stairs and as the building is older there is no lift. The decor of the whole hotel was stunning, even down to room doors all being decorated differently. You can see a lot of care has gone in to keeping the hotel up to a high standard. The room itself was spacious and homely with the lovely touch of a small box of irish chocolates. You can hear some road noise during the night but not enough that it kept me awake. 

Breakfast was just delicious, with friendly and attentive staff. Delia’s walnut and cranberry bread really is worth the hype, I only wish that I could have had a whole loaf or asked for the recipe. Everything was freshly cooked to order and they were more than accommodating with asking for menu changes. I couldn’t have wanted or asked more. 

I would definitely stay here again! 1 minutes walk away from a bus into the city, 20/30 minutes walk into the city, 30 minutes walk to the Aviva stadium and 45 minutes bus from Dublin Airport.",5,2024,06,30
216,"Comfy, relaxing, near city centre","Very comfy room, super comfy bed. Lovely staff and great breakfast. We really felt at ease. Easy walk across the park to city centre. Nice areas to sit outside and inside with free coffee and soda Breadon the afternoon. Would definitely come back here.",5,2024,06,28
216,A nice walk through the Park to all sights,"31 Leeson Close is walking distance through the beautiful St Stephens Park to all the important must sees in Dublin but fa enough away that it is very quiet at night. tThe staff was so friendly, accommodating and spent time with us  suggesting things to do abd see. We had a wonderful first experience in Irekand",5,2024,06,24
216,"Good location, all around great accommodations",My husband and I stayed here for three nights. Our room was spacious and comfortable. The common areas are delightful - whether the outside courtyard or the sunken living area where there’s an honesty bar available. The breakfasts were fantastic and Delia accommodated our early flight by preparing breakfast before the official meal time. Quiet area of Dublin.,5,2024,06,19
216,Exceptional!,"Number 31 was a unique, charming place to stay. We visited here in June of 2024 with another couple. The staff was incredibly helpful and friendly. The breakfast was an added bonus - delicious! We were treated as ""guests"". Would highly recommend. The hotel was also very conveniently located.",5,2024,06,15
216,Would gladly stay here again,"This is a gem: quiet luxury, well trained staff, convenient location. We arrived unannounced around 6 am after a transatlantic flight and were able to relax and eat before siteseeing, then returned to find our room ready early for a much-needed nap. Breakfasts are hearty and delicious. We enjoyed the honesty bar and sunken living room lobby each evening.",5,2024,06,15
216,Lovely stay at No 31 Hotel,"We had a wonderful stay at No 31 Hotel. The staff is so friendly and helpful. Boutique hotel with lots of nice little perks complementary candle, coffee, tea and treats. The complimentary breakfast was delicious in the morning. There is a nice little outdoor patio and gas fireplace. Art work decorates the lobby and there is a nice sunken seating area with honor bar. We only wish we had had more time to spend at No 31.",5,2024,06,15
216,"Delightful, Distinctive Luxury  Boutique Hotel","A lovely and interesting boutique hotel.  The staff was truly outstanding—helpful, knowledgable, friendly, working well together as a team committed to excellent service.  Delia’s breakfasts were superb and Delia herself a delight.  The rooms, though small, were comfortable, lushly decorated, immaculately clean and well appointed with luxury amenities.  The only negative —lots of stairs and no elevator permitted.  The hotel is a registered historic property with classic high ceilings and several floors, so lots of stairs.  Anyone with difficulties ascending/descending stairs may have problems here.",5,2024,06,12
216,Enjoyable stay at Number 31,"This is the second time we have stayed at Number 31. The staff are friendly and welcoming and made our stay very enjoyable.
Delia and staff went above and beyond to ensure our dietary requirements were met and nothing was too much trouble, a big Thank You to everyone.",5,2024,06,09
216,AMAZING!!,"Number 31 is a fabulous small hotel conveniently located near St Stephen’s Green, Trinity College, Grafton Street, and other Dublin sites. I stumbled across this hotel online through sheer serendipity, and count it as one of the highlights of my Dublin stay. The hotel exceeded my expectations. The staff were warm, welcoming, and helpful, the interior design peaceful and attractive, and the breakfast was AMAZING! We sat in a lovely atrium, and savored a bowl of delicious fresh fruit and yogurt, followed by a spinach eggs benedict, one of the several options on the menu. Delia has been cooking fabulous breakfasts there for years, we were told. The breakfast was included in the room price, which was significantly less than many other hotels in this part of Dublin. Highly recommended!",5,2024,06,06
216,Sleeping back in time,"My review applies to the Georgian townhouse. There are two buildings and I would advise staying in this one, not the other one. I really enjoyed my stay. The high-ceilinged room was gorgeous and I felt like I was sleeping in another era. The service was impeccable. Delia's breakfasts really are as fantastic as the other reviews say. Try the Eggs Benedict.   

The location of this hotel is also really great. It's very close to the St. Stephen's park and walking distance to Grafton Street but it's far enough away that it is quiet. Try dining at Matt the Thresher, which is in walking distance. They have live jazz on weekends. House Dublin is also in walking distance and worth checking out.

Any downsides? No AC or room fridges. I read that the stairs can be hard for some people but I had a ground floor room.",5,2024,06,04
216,A gem near St Stephen’s,"Number 31 is a gem.
Going through a hidden back entrance, you enter one of two court yards. Each room you travel through was like a small art gallery. Staff was very attentive. We stayed in room 20 - very private and spacious- architecture was fun and  and throwback to jazzy Chicago.
If you stay- do not miss the to die for breakfast. Delia and her attentive staff start you with fresh  baked breads, fresh fruit and yogurt, fresh squeezed orange juice and of course coffee. Many tasty choices after included herring and kippers, and eggs florentine. If Delia gets a moment to pop her head out of the kitchen- ask her for advice on what to do around town- she is lovely!
My wife and two 20 something kids would love to come back",5,2024,06,02
216,"A stylish, quirky hotel","We had a lovely stay at Number 31.  Lots of positives: comfortable bed, decent shower, great breakfasts, and helpful staff.  The whole decor of the hotel is also really interesting and unusual - we stayed in the old Georgian house on the ground floor (Room 18) which was great, and no real noise from the street.

The location is about a 25 mins (pleasant)  walk to the central attractions, so this is a good choice hotel if you don't want to be right in the middle of the action.

My only complaint really would be that it's a shame the TV was not connected to the internet so we could watch some Netflix and suchlike in the evening.  For the price of the room, a properly smart telly should really be included in my view.",4,2024,05,31
216,Outstanding Hotel,"This is a wonderful boutique hotel. Attention to detail is evident. Fluffy pillows and comfortable bed, complimentary chocolates and lavender pillow spray. The rooms are well decorated in 1930's style furnishings. There's a lovely and comfortable open area for relaxation with a sunken conversation pit. There's also a lovely outside terrance with a feature. When we were there it was too wet and cool to sit outside but it would probably be very comfortable in the warmer seasons.
Breakfast was fabulous and freshly made. In comparison to other B and B's we stayed at in Dublin, Number 31's was outstanding.
The hotel is also centrally located so its easy to access everything.",5,2024,05,30
216,Two great nights,"Number 31 is a delightful boutique hotel with comfortable rooms, attentive staff, and great breakfasts.  The location is terrific for seeing central Dublin sights.  Our room was quiet and well furnished.  No complaints.....our two night stay was wonderful.",5,2024,05,29
216,Great location and start to our trip.,"Staff were very pleasant.  Outdoor garden and sitting areas were a very relaxing retreat after a day of sightseeing. Rooms were fine, though bathroom lighting needs work.  Breakfasts were by far the highlight.  With a full breakfast, no need for lunch.",4,2024,05,28
216,A hearty recommendation,"Number 31 is indeed a boutique hotel, with luxe mattress and pillows and its own special bathroom soaps and boxed chocolates in the room.  Best of all is the breakfast area, hosted by Delia.  We were always greeted with a bowl of fresh berries, fresh squeezed OJ and delicious coffee.  The breakfast choices above and beyond this were many.  And Delia herself is a warm, welcoming presence, the heart and soul of this delightful B&B.",5,2024,05,27
216,Number 31 is an excellent place to stay.,"We had a very enjoyable week at Number 31.  The staff was extremely helpful and Delia, the breakfast chef, was out of this world.  She prepared individual custom breakfast dishes and provided us with great information regarding places to visit and things to do in Dublin.  Our room was very comfortable.",5,2024,05,26
216,I loved my stay at Number 31 Hotel.,"Everything about this boutique hotel was perfect.  The staff was warm and friendly.  The rooms were very large.  I really like the art deco decor.  And the breakfast.  Oh, that breakfast! Travel & Leisure magazine claims this is the best boutique hotel in Dublin.  I agree.",5,2024,05,25
216,A1 experience. Will def return!,"LOVED. Perfect location in a wonderful neighborhood. Walkable to all. Staff was fabulous. Lovely rooms and the breakfasts are phenomenal! Also a lovely garden to read, have a coffee or a glass of wine. Loved the honor bar in the lobby too. Lots of stairs, but all in all a first class experience all the way.",5,2024,05,24
216,Great start to our trip,"This was our first stop on our trip to Ireland and what a way to start! The accomodations were luxurious, the staff beyond friendly, and the breakfasts delicious.  Everything was walkable for us as well. Loved the common seating area in the main building.",5,2024,05,18
216,Excellent choice for a Dublin base,Splendid location with easy access to the city centre but away from the hustle and bustle of the tourist precinct. Easy to walk everywhere. Very quiet rooms. Attentive and caring staff and one of the best breakfasts you will ever come across - thank you Delia,5,2024,05,17
216,"Clean, cozy, quaint","Excellent place! Super cozy, friendly staff, unique boutique hotel. The hotel was very clean and super comfortable. The hotel rooms are very unique. I stayed on the fourth floor in a cute pink, private room. My mom had the most luxurious 50’s glam style room. And their breakfast is so good! I definitely recommend this for a stay!",5,2024,05,13
216,Great Choice!,"Everything about Number 31 was just right, from the magnificent breakfast to the unwavering attention of the staff to the convenient but quiet location. This was our first trip to Dublin, and we couldn't have found a better place to call home for three nights.",5,2024,05,12
216,Quaint and close to activities but very small,"The pictures were a bit deceiving. The location was great but the room was quite small. We were in the “1960s” area. We had no room to put our bags. There was a step up to go to the bathroom so in the middle of the night, you would need to be careful not to trip. The shower didn’t have a door, so the step-off towel got soaked.  The staff was very attentive and brought us more towels. 
The room was quite stuffy so it was nice to open the patio door and get some fresh air.  Breakfast was at 7:30 but the staff was kind enough to let me eat 10min early so I could catch my flight.",3,2024,05,11
216,Highly recommend.,"Excellent breakfast, freshly prepared with home made bread. Very comfortable room, however the bathroom in ‘Sam’s Room’ has no natural light and felt cramped with very low ceiling.
Hotel ideally situated, close to St. Stephen’s Green and across town tram service. Plenty to see and do in a three day break.",4,2024,04,29
216,Beautiful B&B with all the right touches,Beautiful hotel with all the right touches. Every inch is immaculately decorated and designed with care down to the toiletries provided and gift left in the room upon our arrival .  We really enjoyed the beauty as well as the private courtyard and amazing breakfast.  Very easy to forget you are in the center of Dublin.  Nice break and for us the perfect luxurious ending to our Ireland/Scotland adventure.,5,2024,04,28
216,Spacious hidden gem of a boutique hotel.,"Little gem in a perfect location. Relax in the parks, enjoy the beautiful neighborhoods to the south or the more tourist centric areas along the river. Quirky but highly functional room with beautiful light and air. Amazing breakfast and hip honor bar for the evenings. Smiles and help from all the wonderful staff. Caring but non intrusive. Much larger spaces than what you would be used to for the money in Ireland or the UK. Highly recommend.",5,2024,04,25
216,Oasis in the middle of Dublin,"This is the second time we have stayed at no. 31. We enjoyed our visit so much the first time last year we decided to return again this year and we were not disappointed. We plan to go again next year and hope to have friends join us!
The staff are friendly and helpful. The decor is lovely. The rooms are spacious and comfortable. The garden area for guests to enjoy is welcoming and a lovely oasis right in the heart of the city.
The day starts well with an inclusive breakfast prepared by No. 31’s own chef, Delia, delicious. There is lots of choice and the breakfast area is bright and welcoming.
There is an honour bar and lounge for guests to enjoy at their leisure, a nice touch.
Location could not be better to explore Dublin.",5,2024,04,24
216,The legend lives on…,"Under the expert care of Noel and Deirdre Comer, Number 31's timeless charm was infused with a new level of refinement and sophistication. Their legacy lives on in every elegant detail, from the tastefully curated decor to the impeccable service. The current owners have built upon this foundation, enhancing the guest experience with modern amenities and thoughtful touches. It's clear that Noel and Deirdre Comer's vision continues to inspire and shape Number 31, creating a haven of luxury and comfort for guests to enjoy. PS this is my third return visit over twenty years, and it won’t be my last!",5,2024,04,23
216,Perfect honeymoon homebase,"We stayed here for the second leg of our honeymoon in the ""fabulous double"" and we will definitely be recommending number 31 to anyone that will be traveling to dublin. Everything was a short walk away, and the rooms are stunning. It is truly one of the best places that we have stayed in all of our travels. We would stay for Delia and her breakfast alone! Five stars ⭐️ 

Food: 
I must repeat this again that Delia's breakfast is a must. Although you can order a la carte, we opted for delia's breakfast when booking and we were glad that we did. As we figured out what to order we were treated to a spread of freshly squeezed OJ, a personal french press of freshly brewed coffee, house made bread +preserves, and sliced fruit with yogurt. My wife's favorite was the slice of what i believe was a cranberry and orange loaf. After the first day she would even save it as a treat to have at the end of the meal. This is all before the main dishes. We each tried something different every day and everything from the frittata to the florentine were all extremely delicious and exactly what we needed to get us going for a long day out in dublin. Truly a highlight from the trip.

Location: 
The location was great it is extremely close to st steven's green as well as O'Donoghues, and is maybe a 15 or so minute walk from the main ""downtown"" area. The walk to guinness storehouse is a bit further but definitely doable for most. We only ended up calling an uber once in our four day trip but it was mainly due to the rain and the fact we had a couple pints after lunch.🫡 It was the perfect home base.

The hotel: 
It consists of two buildings that is connected by a central courtyard. The front building was the home of an architect who built in an amazing conversation pit, fireplace, and a self service bar (open till 11) that is  that is near by. Then a back building has a beautiful and luxurious vintage feel. It is a few stories tall with a staircase that leads to your rooms and a chandelier on top. We (as in mostly me) was preparing to lift our heavier than average luggage up a few flights but once we checked in staff insisted on first showing us our room and then brought our luggage up for us.

Room: It was beautiful, the ornate stylings and the large window overlooking the courtyard was more than we imagined. The bed was large and comfortable. Definitely made me want to upgrade my pillows at home. The rain shower and the rooms solid water pressure was what we needed after staying in a cramped london flat for the first leg of our trip. We did wish that there was a fridge for when we had leftovers but everything else was so great it really wasn't a problem. Let us try more things while we were there anyway🙌

But overall amazing experience and will definitely be coming here on my next trip to dublin.☘️🇮🇪",5,2024,03,30
216,First-Rate Number 31,"My fiancée and I spent three nights at Number 31 on our first trip to Ireland. We were absolutely delighted by every aspect of our stay. The location, a few blocks from St. Stephen's Green, is great for exploring Dublin on foot. Our small room in Sam Stephenson's house was comfortable. The staff were all friendly and helpful. We particularly appreciated Ruth's allowing us to check in a bit early and her knowledge of the property. Best of all, the breakfasts really are superb. Delia is both a wonderful cook and a warm, wise presence. She gave us information about Dublin that truly enhanced our visit. We recommend Number 31 enthusiastically and will stay there again.",5,2024,03,29
216,True Gem in Dublin,"I needed to write a review immediately following our stay because it far outweighed even the high expectations that we had had for it. In 2010, we traveled to Ireland for the first time with kids and had read about the lovely Ballyvolane House, which is still one of our absolute favorite places here. While we stayed with them we picked up the “Hidden Ireland” brochure in their lobby. Included in the brochure, were several manor houses and beautiful inns located all over the country. We spotted Number 31, and added it to our bucket list of hotels that we wanted to stay at. Of all of our annual trips, we just never had the opportunity to stay in Dublin. Fast forward 14 years, we decided to include Dublin on our itinerary and quickly booked Number 31. Well, to say it was worth the wait is an understatement. (We are actually already figuring out how we can come back on a future trip.) The hotel was absolutely stunning! The comfiest beds, Voya products, nice welcome treats, Honor Bar, mouth watering breakfast, and an incredibly kind, helpful and knowledgeable staff. We were all blown away! ❤️🍀🇮🇪",5,2024,03,29
216,Wonderful stay,"Well what can we say, what special  place! A fantastic location, superb room with a beautiful garden view. We had a wonderful stay at Number 31, for us the person that made it special was Delia. She cooked the best breakfasts that we have ever tasted and  was a wealth of local knowledge and truly cared about our Dublin experience. What a star",5,2024,03,19
216,Beautiful hotel,"AMAZING stay - reception staff were friendly and welcoming, the room was spotless and had everything we needed. But the star of the stay was Delia and the breakfast team - the breakfast was the best we have ever had and cooked to perfection. This place is definitely worth staying at - thank you",5,2024,03,17
216,One of our favorite hotels yet,"Number 31 was a major highlight of our time in Ireland! The styling and ambiance of the hotel is cozy, chic, and romantic. It feels so tucked away and private, even though it’s near enough to many of Dublin’s more popular sightseeing areas. I can only imagine how extra beautiful the back garden is once spring hits and all of the flowers bloom! But one of the very best things about this hotel is the breakfast; Delia made an absolutely delicious breakfast on the days we were able to make it, and on our last day she even started cooking before breakfast started to make us some food before we had to leave for the airport early. Above and beyond — and delicious! We felt so well cared for here by all of the staff, and had a really lovely experience. I would absolutely recommend staying here.",5,2024,03,16
216,Great experience!,Fantastic hotel and kind and attentive staff. Breakfast was fantastic. We arrived on a morning flight and the staff went out of their way to turn over the room and notify us as soon as we could check in early. Definitely above and beyond. Highly recommend!,5,2024,03,13
216,Cozy and cool,"Really fun hotel. It was cozy and cool at the same time, and Delia’s breakfast was amazing. She came out and chatted with us and gave us good tips for our trip. It was fun hanging out in the sunken living room by the fire in the evening. Would definitely come back!",5,2024,03,11
216,"Not impressed, poor management.","Room 12 had a leaky tap so sink was wet on arrival. The loo had less room than a public loo at a train station and the loo seat kept falling back on us.  When I told reception she said she would look at this, and later she said it wasn't falling on her or  the maintenance guy - as if I was making it up?    
On the second day we found a centipede/slug crawling on the bedroom floor - and then a few more on the shower by the mouldy grouting.  I took pictures as proof - and reported it to the reception and was told she would take a look when we went out.  I explained they seemed to be coming from the grouting.  
On our return she said she couldn't find any and poured bleach down the drain, even though that is not where they were coming from.  The next night there were several more centipedes crawling by the shower grouting again - this is gross and not what I would expect of any hotel/guesthouse/B&B charging these prices.  Reception had put a  bottle of Prosecco in our room as an apology but we didn't want or have time to drink it.  The noise was also a huge issue, we were directly beneath the kitchen, and we could hear endless thumps and footsteps along with other guests opening and closing doors.  The breakfasts were good but unfortunately that does not make up for the other issues.  
Upon checking out, we were asked to pay for the three drinks we had consumed during our stay, which we thought was disgraceful after everything I had brought to their attention.  They could have at least taken those drinks off the bill as a goodwill gesture and good customer service.",2,2024,02,26
216,Highly recommend,"We have stayed here a few times when we have gone to Dublin for medical reasons, the building is beautiful, very stylish, clean and comfortable,  The staff are lovely and very accommodating.   I would stay here again and would recommend without hesitation.  Thank you for a peaceful stay",5,2024,02,25
216,Cozy refuge in the heart of Dublin,"The coziest spot with incredibly genuine hospitality. In a prime location, we easily took one bus there straight from the train station, and it’s close to everything yet tucked away. Do not miss the breakfast! Thoughtful and intentional interior design.",5,2024,02,25
216,"Faultless, incredible stay.","This hotel and its team are an absolute asset to Dublin. We stayed for two nights in room 19 and it was a gorgeous experience. Beautiful room, silence, peace, outrageously large and comfortable bed, beautifully furnished. Wonderful shower.

Breakfast was, as many have already said, faultless. Simply delicious. 

I would go back in a heartbeat. Highly recommended.",5,2024,02,21
216,Great stay at Number 31,"We had an amazing stay at the Number 31 in Dublin.  They were so incredibly accommodating and kind.  The way our trip to Dublin was planned out,  we ended up leaving Dublin for a bit and returning at the end of the week.  We stayed in both the intimate double and the plush double.  Both rooms were very nice. The intimate double is more modern with less room to move around and the plush double gives you PLENTY of room for two people and a totally different decorating style.  The accommodation's are nothing compared to the hospitality of the people that work there and Delia’s breakfast.  NEITHER disappoint!   They top off your stay and make it overall 5 star +.  Thank you Number 31.",5,2024,02,20
216,Lovely hotel - Delia’s breakfast is not to be missed!,"Lovely boutique hotel that is really well located, it feels like staying in your own Georgian townhouse. The staff on reception were all really cheerful and helpful. The highlight has to be the breakfast - Delia and her staff are wonderful and everything is delicious. We can’t wait to come back.",5,2024,02,16
216,Fabulous stay in the heart of Dublin,"Myself and my husband were so happy we chose this hotel as a last minute decision. The hotel staff are extremely helpful and considerate. The room are warm, comfortable and made for one of the best night's sleep I've had in a long time. The highlight of our stay was the breakfast... Fresh, delicious quality produce superbly cooked. A delight to be sure. 
Would happily stay again, just a note of advice to request a ground floor room if you have mobility issues.",5,2024,02,13
216,Delia's breakfast,It's been 14 years since we last stayed and Delia's breakfast was as good as ever. Her baked goods are always a highlight. Room was very comfy and we loved the voya products. We had a great stay and will definitely come back again. Hopefully sooner than 14 years :-),5,2024,02,12
216,Truly Delightful Hotel and Breakfast,"Modern and Art Deco in a Georgian townhouse? Yes! These architecture styles artfully combine to  make for a delightful experience at Number  31.  This is a truly unique hotel with Irish charm. The staff is exceptional and attentive, the location quiet and convenient, the rooms exquisitely appointed, and the BEST breakfast experience to date.  Delia's Breakfast at Number 31  is only surpassed by Delia herself - charming and eager to make your trip memorable with spot on recommendations. Starting with fresh fruit, juice, yogurt, a heavenly selections of breads,  choose a full Irish Breakfast, Eggs Benedict or Florentine or more - all are delicious and a must when visiting Dublin.  It's no wonder Delia's- and Number 31 -  have earned so many awards: all very well deserved. I will be back!",5,2024,02,01
216,A Dublin City stay to remember,"Such a uniquely styled hotel, staff are extremely friendly and knowledgeable on the history of the hotel, and can’t do enough to make the stay one to remember. Beds are very comfortable the complimentary pillow spray is a beautiful touch. The breakfast options are amazing with a bright communal area to enjoy it.",5,2024,01,28
216,"Stylish, cosy and central","One of the best hotels I've stayed in for a long time - clean, stylish, amazing breakfast and helpful staff. Really central location so it was never longer than a 30 min walk to anywhere centrally in Dublin.",5,2024,01,24
216,The best breakfast in Dublin! A hidden gem.,"We stayed in the family room. Four girls sharing and we had more than adequate room. It is so spacious. So warm and comfortable on what was a very cold wet weekend. The bathroom was spotless with lovely toiletries and towels. 
The breakfast was out of this world. Delia is an amazing chef. Her breakfasts are up there with any of the top hotels. Everything was fresh and homemade. The produce was good quality. Her potato cakes are so delicious and she was kind enough to share the recipe so I can try at home. It was the highlight of the stay! 

It’s a hidden gem so close to the city centre with no need for taxis. 
The staff are so kind and welcoming and nothing was a problem. 
We have rebooked again for August! 
Looking forward to going back.",5,2024,01,20
216,Great Experience,"From check in to check out it was a great experience. 
Staff were excellent and the room was so beautiful and comfortable. 
Breakfast was fabulous. 
The hotel has a very personal feel to it. 
Would highly recommend",5,2024,01,17
216,Style Stays Here 💕,"We absolutely love Number 31! It’s my second stay there, last time was with children, and both times they exceeded  expectations. Eclectic decor, comfy beds, delicious breakfasts & extremely helpful staff. They model their mantra of Style Stays Here in everything they do.",5,2024,01,13
216,Fantastic service ,"We recently stayed at Number 31 ,and we fallen in love with the place.Me and my friend we are not TripAdvisor if we have something to say we express ourselves directly to staff but this time we felt different and this place needs to be highly recommended.Our room 43 was perfect for our needs ,it’s a small room but what you need when you are in a new city somewhere to shower-change-sleep and you put it on repeat ,not to spend the day on a hotel room . Everyone was so kind and helpful. Breakfast was top notch. Big thanks to Mihai and his crew for looking after us . If we will get the chance to come back to Dublin Number 31 is our place . ",5,2024,01,08
216,For a wedding avoid at all costs. Slippery charging regime ,"Booked 11 rooms for a wedding 31st December. Avoid it at all costs. 
1) Very dodgy way to charge people. Check your bills in advance here as manager very slippery 
2)Bride could not get coffee refilled room morning of wedding requested twice, dirty towels on arrival, supplies not refilled, even when asked
3) Doors left unlocked after cleaning. Patio door left open, cleaning products left in my daughter's room
4) manager could not care less. Ask Staff they say they will ask manager. Nothing happens. We expressed our concern to the manager following our visit, no response to date. 
5) if you are a bride having a wedding or someone looking for a bit of service at these prices - run. Do not stay here. The team at the wedding venue 25 were fantastic. Without them would have been a different story.

In summary : could be good. Doubt manager has proper hotel background as does not appear to be able to handle it when things go wrong. Awful experience to be honest. ",1,2024,01,07
216,Great Location & A Unique Hotel,"Lovely residential hotel and a terrific party of Dublin.  The bespoke boutique hotel was a little hidden off the main drag, located on a tiny side street.  You walk up to a locked door and ring the bell and a hotel representative will buzz you in.  The lobby has a sunken-in couch and cozy fireplace.  Super 1960’s mid-century party house vibe in the first building.  There was also a loaded honor bar and upstairs is a quaint indoor/outdoor area where breakfast is served.  
We had 2 rooms.  The first room was in the same building as reception.  Adorable room on the lower level with two beds, HUGE bathroom (no tub just shower), a cute sitting area and the loveliest outdoor patio.  My daughter’s loved their room. 
Our second room, a family suite, was located through a beautiful courtyard with fire pit, tables and chairs, and lovely gardens.  The room was located in the second building, lower level.  This building is MUCH older than the first building, but so quaint.  Our second room was GIANT.  It had three beds (one king and two twins).  The bathroom as fine, not as large as my daughter’s room.  Be aware, the room on the lower level has a window, but you don’t look out at anything.  It is frosted.  There were nice robes, bottled water, coffee/tea, chocolates and a candle in the room.  
The bath towels were huge and luxurious.  The daily maid service was a wonderful treat.  
The only issue with the room was the toilet would inconsistently run and run and run after flushing it.  Also, the drain in the bathroom sink would gurgle loudly at night. I found the beds comfy, but my husband felt the mattress was a little lumpy for his liking.  We never heard anyone except when our neighbors would come back and put their room key on the door.  
The front desk people were kind and would order cabs for us and they were attentive to any needs and answered all questions.  
We only ate breakfast one morning.  Breakfast is from 8-10am, so late sleepers will miss out.  All the breakfast offerings are savory, so if you have a picky kid who only likes nasty Eggo waffles or sugar cereal, you won’t find it here.  The breakfast portions are HUGE, so be prepared for a very large meal.  It was good and the staff was attentive.  
I would definitely recommend this hotel and would stay at it again.  It was so nice to stay somewhere non-major brand like Marriott or Hilton.  You could definitely sense a very high level of customer service that sometimes the chain hotels lack.  
Be aware, if you do stay there with your family, and you need two rooms, you likely will be split into two buildings and you won’t have the standard adjacent rooms you may be used to.  I was ok with it because my daughters are older teens, but if they were younger I would have requested rooms closer to each other.  
Overall, a lovely hotel and a unique experiences.  Tons of restaurants, a terrific park, and Temple Bar/Historical sites all within walking distance.  I would recommend.",5,2024,01,06
216,Immense disappointment,"I stayed in this hotel in July. I loved it. I loved it's Art Deco design and it's attention to the art deco details , the pictures,the lights,the shelled patterned carpet,the individual doors,walking through the courtyard . I came home and spread the news. I booked for December.  The room I was given was directly opposite the back entrance therefore on entering and exiting the room I did not have to go through the hotel. I could not experience any of the art deco ambience or the Christmas setting  in the foyer. I was free to explore but this did not live up to the same experience I had previously of being swept into a time of art deco decadence . My disappointment was immense.",3,2024,01,03
216,Subtle Luxury,"We recently stayed a Number 31 after a weekend wedding in Galway. We needed a stopover in Dublin before flying back to London. We choose this quite and  very comfortable hotel and had a great nights sleep followed by a superb breakfast. the bedroom was luxuriously appointed and warm, after a cold walk around Dublin this was judt what we needed. We will cetainly stay here again when we go to Dublin",5,2024,01,02
216,"A wonderful stay, highly recommend ","Gorgeous stay, really friendly staff. Beautiful boutique hotel very close to Stephen’s Green.

216,Best Breakfast in Dublin,"Delia's breakfast was the best we had during our entire trip to Ireland! She was the most accommodating and very kind. On our day of departure, we have a very early morning flight and she arrived at the hotel earlier than usual to make sure we had breakfast before we checked out. Next time we go to Dublin, we will most certainly be staying at Number 31 again! ",5,2023,12,28
216,Drop the 3 because this place is Number 1! ,"Location, Location, Location! Perfectly positioned away from the noise and busier streets but only a short walk to St. Stephen's Green, famous Grafton Street Shopping, Trinity College, Dublin Castle and some pretty amazing pubs. Check out Sussex Restaurant above Obrien's Pub -  Best Fish & Chips eva!  Oh, and House. The Hummingbird was hands down the best cocktail I have ever had. And Umi - I am still thinking about that minted lemonade and falafel. 

But what made Number 31 really special was the staff. Everyone was so warm and welcoming and Delia made us feel like family. She and her staff were so friendly and accommodating and the breakfast is truly amazing. Just a great place to stay all around. 

If I am lucky enough to make it back to Dublin I would definitely stay here again! ",5,2023,12,27
216,A very special place - living history!,"We could not have found a more perfect place to land for a magical mini break before Christmas. Ruth the Receptionist was particularly welcoming - what a smile! 
And huge thanks to Ray for giving us a unique insight into the legendary (whatever your views on architecture!) Sam Stephenson. Living history, faithfully maintained. Sam would be happy! 
A most memorable experience. 
We will be back.

216,Wonderful hotel. The omelette alone is worth staying for ,"The hotel is ideally located a few minutes from St Stephen’s green. Remarkable value for money all things considered. Attention to detail is exemplary, rooms are very smart and staff are very welcoming. The breakfast was the highlight - perfectly cooked to order! ",5,2023,12,16
216,Birthday trip to Dublin,"I booked Number 31 as a surprise for my husband's birthday trip to Dublin. It was our first trip to Ireland and staying at Number 31 made it all the more special.  The staff were so welcoming from the moment we arrived, the  decor of our room was gorgeous, the  bed was the comfiest I have experienced in a hotel, the toiletries  lovely and  Delia's breakfasts were fabulous. It was the perfect location to explore the city from; Charlemont tram stop is a 10 minute walk, the bus stop is outside and even the aircoach back to the airport, stopped just 3 minutes up the road. The choice of restaurants and bars within a 20 minute walk is great and lovely to come back to the hotel and relax in the lounge with a drink from the 'honesty' bar.

216,"Fabulous, welcoming, definately a return visit.","If you haven't stayed in this hidden gem you have missed out. Beautifully nestled in the heart of Dublin 2, the most professional and friendly staff provide rooms and guest areas that are beautifully designed and welcoming. The bedrooms are very well finished off and have the most comfortable beds and pillows. However, the best feature by far of this wonderful place is Delia's breakfast! Prepared freshly to order Delia's breakfast is by far the best in the country and has to be experienced to be appreciated. In particular Delia's walnut and cranberry bread is a delight to the tastebuds and leaves you looking for more! 10/10",5,2023,11,22
216,Lovely hotel,"Number 31 was the perfect place to spend a spring week in Dublin. Delia's breakfasts got the day off to an amazing start. Both the food and the service was outstanding, and Delia herself couldn't have been more warm and friendly. The location allowed for easy access to everywhere we wanted to go, with fantastic restaurants and most attractions within easy walking distance. We walked miles and enjoyed every minute! My room was very comfortable and nicely appointed. Next time I'm in Dublin, I'll be staying again at Number 31.",5,2023,11,12
216,Number 31 is the best experience in Dublin!,"everything was perfect! and the people who work there are so sweet and kind! the hotel room is very neat and clean! and the bed and pillow are.... 😍😍😍

Delia and her breakfasts were wonderful..Such a lovely charming lady..makes guests feel like long lost family or friends.. Can't wait to return !! ",5,2023,11,04
216,Nice Spot,We didn’t spend a ton of time in the hotel as we were busy exploring Dublin. Number 31 however is a lovely and quiet spot to lay your head after a long day out and about. Conveniently located near the action of the city but not so close that you can’t sleep at night. ,5,2023,11,02
216,Wonderful place to stay,"The hotel was lovely, eclectic and elegantly laid out rooms. Friendly staff. Exceptional location. We could not give higher praise for Delia and the Irish breakfast. It was the warmest, most convivial experience in a hotel for a long time (and the brekkers is outstanding). I cannot imagine staying anywhere else when we are back in Dublin",5,2023,10,29
216,Boutique hotel,"Number 31 is Boutique hotel in a great location, the rooms are spacious, bright and clean.

One of the better hotels in Dublin …
Thanks to Ray and his team there for the welcoming stay!

216,Amazing anniversary trip!,"Stayed 4 nights total during a 25th anniversary trip to Ireland. This hotel is charming and has a great sense of place. The rooms are all different, tidy, and comfortable. The staff were warm, accommodating, and solicitous. When we arrived, Clara made special arrangements for an early check in and sent us to breakfast on arrival, even though the dining room had just closed. What a lovely welcome! She also worked in the dining room and was particularly warm and friendly. All of the staff were helpful and accommodating. The highlight of the stay is Delia's breakfast. First, it is absolutely delicious, fresh, local and cooked to order by Delia in the bright and beautiful dining room and under the greenhouse. Second, Delia is an absolute delight, full of charm, and generous with advice about Ireland, Dublin, Irish travel and food. We will never forget her. We tried as many dishes as we could in four days, and every single one was memorable and outstanding. The best irish porridge ever and world class eggs benedict. The location of the hotel is within walking distance of all the major sites, but quiet and peaceful. You will be surprised by the front door. All in all, a wonderful place to stay while visiting Dublin and we would return in a heartbeat just to see Delia again.",5,2023,10,26
216,Can’t miss!,"Amazing hotel. Rooms are perfectly appointed— the sheets and mattress are luxurious. Great shower. 

The breakfast is also 10/10. Poached eggs were perfectly done, which is rare. Can’t miss with this place. Service is spot on and everyone is friendly and helpful.",5,2023,10,23
216,Stay at Number 31,"We had a lovely stay.  The room was very comfortable, the breakfasts were delicious and all the staff were extremely pleasant and helpful.  The hotel had a great location for our purposes as we could walk everywhere we wanted to go.",5,2023,10,17
216,This is your best bet in Dublin,"This place is outstanding. Special mentions for Delia, Claudia and  Mihai. The neighborhood is quiet. The breakfasts as spectacular. Within waljing distance to any place you want to go in Dublin. The Hop On Hop Off bus is very close. St. Stephen’s Square park also very close. 

You will LOVE IT",5,2023,10,16
216,Oasis in the City!,"Was fortunate to spend a week in Dublin at this hotel. Location is incredible, you're tucked away from all of the noise in a boutique hotel with it's own private courtyard whilst at the same time being in the heart of the city. Michai and his team were incredible and unbelievably friendly to all guests and you can see they really want visitors to feel welcome with suggestions on places to go and sites to see. Breakfast is served upstairs and Delia who is the chef, always has time to chat and ask about plans for the day alongisde being able to cook to order for all guests in record time. Simply cannot express how much I love this place. Thank you to everyone for making this week so memorable and can't wait to visit again at Christmas :)",5,2023,10,16
216,"Whenever we return to Dublin, this is where we will stay.","I can’t say enough about the No. 31. While not the easiest spot to find as it’s just off the road down a small side street, the service was excellent, the rooms were great, and it was the breakfast we had in Ireland. From the moment we checked in we were retread like superstars. We arrived early. No rom was ready. Not only did they take our bags and but them in the room while we were away, but they helped us plan our day, travel, walking and made interesting suggestions for places to stop that we had not considered. The room was very comfortable and quiet. The breakfast the next morning was awesome. The kitchen staff was super helpful.  If I could give the No. 31 six stars, I would. We’ll done.",5,2023,10,15
216,Like Being Home in Dublin,"The staff could not have been more accommodating. It was like we found our home in Dublin. The breakfast was world class, and Delia was amazing. Not only does she make a mean omelette, but she cared for my Granddaughter like she was hers. We’ll definitely go back to 31, and my family will talk about our Dublin trip for years to come.",5,2023,10,11
216,Best breakfast ever! ,"The best part of the stay was chef Delia and her incredible breakfast. Once you have her porridge there is no going back! 

As far as rooms go make sure you book the largest ones. The smallest rooms are too small for a couple. 

The concierge and the team were incredibly helpful. ",4,2023,10,10
216,Absolutely loved-  5 Stars!!!,"I’m on my way to Galway from Dublin, but I could not wait to write a review for Number 31.  What a lovely lovely stay!!!  My husband & I and another couple stayed 3 nights and we could not have had a nicer introduction to Ireland than staying here!  From the quaint boutique hotel feel to the immaculate clean rooms and shared spaces, I believed I am spoiled for any other accommodation.  
     The crowning jewel was the breakfast room and superbly prepared to order hot breakfasts, Irish love in every bite.  Standing ovation to the Delia and her staff for exceptional attention to detail at every turn.  Thank you.  {Hugs}",5,2023,10,09
216,Quiet Georgian Townhouse Retreat in the City,"My husband and I ended our trip to Ireland in Dublin the last 3 days with a fabulous stay at Number 31. We arrived at Dublin Hueston train station and grabbed a taxi just outside the doors for a 15-20 minute ride to Number 31. A little hidden gem on Leeson Close in a quiet Georgian townhouse neighborhood of the city. We arrived around noon, but they were able to accommodate an early check-in. While we waited for our luggage to be delivered to the room we enjoyed fresh baked cookies and complimentary espresso in the mews building lounge appointed with a sitting area and fireplace. We were later told it was the former home of the Irish architect, Sam Stephenson, a student of Frank Lloyd Wright. The influence was apparent. We were escorted to our room, and given the keys to the room and outside property gate. Our room was located in the lovely Georgian townhouse which has maintained its original beauty, but with all of the modern updates needed for a comfortable stay. There is no elevator, so keep in mind you will be using a staircase. There is a beautifully landscaped private courtyard between the townhouse and the mews.  We enjoyed relaxing with a glass of wine in the peaceful courtyard with an outdoor fire pit in the evening after a day of walking, and the breakfasts, served in the mews, were a filling and delicious start to the next full day of walking! The location is close enough to walk to all of the sites in the city center, but removed just enough southeast of St Stephen’s Green at Leeson to enjoy a less busy area of the city when you retreat for the day. Buses, LUAS, or taxi’s are easily accessible if not walking. The staff was so friendly and courteous. The atmosphere was personal and made to feel like you were a guest at someone’s home. Number 31 was a perfect ending to our memorable trip to different areas throughout Ireland, and made our stay in Dublin really one of the best parts of Dublin!",5,2023,10,06
216,Breakfast at Number 31 is an unexpected culinary delight.,"If you've ever wondered what it would be like to have a loving Irish mum (who happened to be a gourmet chef) cook you an unbelievable breakfast every day before sending you out into the world, you can now find out at Number 31. Chef Delia prepares individual breakfasts for guest at Number 31 every morning, making those early morning hours a delight. Breakfast begins with fresh squeezed orange juice and coffee or tea. There is a bowl of fresh fruit and yogurt. And then their's Delia's homemade cranberry/walnut bread and traditional brown bread, fresh butter, and Delia's homemade marmalade and homemade raspberry jam. And all this is just the beginning. Next comes several versions of Benedict--with ""streaky bacon,"" or smoked salmon, or (my favorite) mushrooms and lightly sautéed spinach. If Benedicts aren't your thing, there are omelets, frittatas, or Irish porridge. Whatever you select, it is prepared to order, served steaming hot, and nourishes body and soul. Enjoy!",5,2023,10,05
216,Dublin Gem,We only had one night in this magical place but it was lovely. The staff were so friendly and helpful. The breakfast was amazing. Our room was perfect. The entire property is super unique and full of all kinds of fun artwork. We will for sure be back for a longer stay. ,5,2023,10,05
216,Great Location + Delicious Breakfast ,"We highly recommend staying at Number 31 for a trip to Dublin. We stayed for four nights and enjoyed our room and Delia’s breakfast. We arrived around checkout time, so our room wasn’t ready. The reception staff was very helpful in checking us in and keeping our bags while we explored the city. When we came back later in the afternoon, our room was ready and our bags were already in her room, which was extremely helpful as our room was on the top floor, and there was no lift.

Breakfast was delicious and featured freshly squeezed orange juice, coffee, fruit, baked goods, and a menu of hot breakfast items. We never had to wait for a table and our breakfast came out right away each time. The location of this hotel is great because it is far enough away from the noisy area of Grafton Street but also a short (10min) walk to the main attractions and the DART station. 

The reception staff were always very friendly and helpful in ordering taxis and giving recommendations. We will certainly stay here again on our next trip to Dublin.",4,2023,10,04
216,Best spot in Dublin,Number 31 is an incredible property with the most accommodating staff. The rooms are absolutely beautiful and their breakfast is top-notch. I'll be sure to stay at Number 31 again next time I'm in Dublin. ,5,2023,10,01
216,"Delia, we love your breakfast! ","We had a 2 night stay in Dublin.  We took the Aircoach route 700 on arrival at T1. We arrived in Leeson Street Lower stop about 50 minutes later. This is the closest stop to Number 31 about a 5 minute walk.  As you step off the Aircoach, walk right, up the street until you see a Starbucks on the corner of a small turning. Turn left into the little street, and Number 31 is on the right. The door is hidden slightly like a secret doorway into a fictional novel. Press the bell, and you enter a small courtyard.  Into the mews entrance and walk round into the lounge area. The sunken lounge area is like something out of a 007 movie with an honesty bar off and a welcoming fire.  Up a few steps to a small but perfect reception area.  The reception staff are beyond helpful.  Carrying your luggage and answering your many questions.  Customer service at its best!  To the side of the reception area up steps is the breakfast room.  More on breakfast later.  We were shown our room, out of reception, into an external decked area.  Down a few steps across an immaculate garden with a fire pit.  It's gorgeous if the weather was warm, although the fire pit was kicking some heat out.  This lead to the rooms in a townhouse situated at the other end.  Up some steps to the entrance and into an art deco world.  Love ❤️.  Our room was up another 4 flights of stairs, we didn't have a themed room, although they must be amazing.  Our room was perfect, a little entrance hallway off it was the bathroom with wonderful toiletries and a monsoon head shower.  Then our bedroom with super comfy bed  pillows your head disappeared into.  Tea, coffee and complimentary water, plus a sleep spray for your pillow.  Loved the room although fairly compact it did the job. The themed rooms must have been lush.  So breakfast, what can I say, you've got to experience it.  Delia was friendly, chatty and cooked great food.  Freshly squeezed orange juice, freshly baked cake, fruit salad, with alsorts of fruit not just your peaches and orange segments with plain yoghurt if you wanted it.  Breakfast choice was first class.  But the full Irish, well, do it!  We had to leave for our flight early the second morning, but Delia made sure we had fresh orange juice, tea, toast and wonderful fruit salad again  along with the baked stuff.  You just need to mention it to her breakfast before and she's got you sorted.  We really enjoyed our stay and would love to come back.  As for location, ok it's a bit more of a walk than your usual close to temple bar hotels, but you need a decent sleep right?  Got this in abundance at Number 31.  Nearest hop on bus stops were through the lovely park St Stephens Green, about a 10 minute walk away, the main action about 15 minutes walk. So pretty close really and well you get to meet Delia, and the lovely reception chaps (one of which looked like a young Stephen Barlett).

216,Fantastic unique stay ,"A very unique place to stay. From the moment of arrival the staff were so welcoming and down to earth. Location was excellent .Breakfast was also excellent. Will definitely return..
P.s the pilllows were unreal 🙂",5,2023,09,29
216,An Excellent Stay in Dublin ,"Three things that I want to point out: 
1. Service was phenomenal
2. The breakfasts were amazing 
3. Great location for walking. 
Number 31 is a great little boutique hotel, with a lovely courtyard and cozy rooms. Americans may find the rooms a little bit on the small side, but you'd be remiss not to stay here, while In Dublin. We found the beds comfortable and we had an enough space for the luggage of two people traveling for close to a month. 
The service staff take hospitality to a high level. 
Breakfast in the morning was fantastic. If you left hungry, and dissatisfied, it's your fault. No matter what you like to eat, there was something satisfying for you. 
Lastly, the location is great. Just about 10 minutes walking to St. Stephen's Green, which gets you to Grafton Street, Trinity College, and several other attractions by foot. The Guinness Store House and some of the other attractions are a short cab ride away, or a longer walk. 
I would recommend staying here, and I would choose this place again. 
",5,2023,09,29
216,So Happy We Stayed Here!,"I am so happy we chose to stay at Number 31! Last week, my husband and I spent four nights in Room 16 and it was absolutely perfect! From the moment we arrived, everyone was so welcoming and helpful. We were provided with great recommendations on what to do and where to go. The room was spacious, well designed, comfortable, and very pretty. The location is perfect. It was a very short walk to St. Stephen's Green, close to public transportation (if you needed it), quiet, and close to a very cute coffee shop. The breakfasts were absolutely fabulous! They were so filling and delicious! My favorite thing about staying here though were the staff. Everyone was so friendly! I would gladly stay here again and would highly recommend it to anyone coming to Dublin. Thank you for making our trip so memorable! ",5,2023,09,26
216,Wonderful home base away from the noise in Dublin,What a great home base - a large quiet ground floor room #11 with a small patio.  We spent 3 nights here and had wonderful staff take care of our every need!  I left something behind and they even offered to ship it to me - so thoughtful!  We enjoyed our walks to and through Saint Steven’s Green to get to a bus and anywhere beyond.  Breakfast was plentiful and delicious - with care taken for special requests.  The corner PUB - Madigans - serves a great steak and Guinness stew!  I would highly recommend!,5,2023,09,24
216,Unique hotel with surprises,"This unique Georgian style hotel has a boutique feel. The architectural details are exquisite. The beds and linens perfect. The courtyard is an added bonus to enjoy a meal or drinks from the honor bar.  
The heated bathroom floor and heated towel rack were a nice touch. 

I would have to say that the very best part of the entire experience was the Irish breakfast provided by Delia and her crew. She and her staff are there to please and her delicious food did indeed please! She went above and beyond by having us come to breakfast before the breakfast room was supposed to open so we could eat before we left for our long journey home. Also she arranged for a taxi to the airport. Delia’s delightful stories and warm personality made us feel at home. This woman works seven days a week! God bless her! 
We give Delia ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️",4,2023,09,23
216,perfect for our needs!!,the breakfasts were amazing!  loved the honor bar and quiet area as well as the sitting area and fountain outside with seating.  location was great and our room was spacious and very comfortable.  check in was a breeze.,5,2023,09,22
216,A hidden Dublin gem,"Their moniker, “The Fabulous Room” 100% lives up to its name! It’s so elegantly fun without being stuffy and pretentious. And there are many interesting objects and details to feast your eyes on. And breakfast by Delia - oh geez, you rarely get free breakfast that’s made to order and this lively lady can sure cook you up a good one! Delia is so personable and so accommodating. She even remembered my husband’s gluten sensitivity on day 2.  Gosh I love this place❤️",5,2023,09,18
216,"Cozy rooms, amazing breakfast!","What this place lacks in size, it makes up for in character. The rooms are  comfortable and cozy. If, like us, you opt for one of the smaller, more budget-friendly rooms, we found many areas around the property to relax - from the sunken lounge with an honor bar to the beautiful deck and gardens. This was a great place to stay while exploring Dublin! The location is on a quiet street and only a short walk from St. Stephens Green, the Gaiety theater and shopping on Grafton St. As other reviewers mentioned, the breakfasts are to die for! The staff are very attentive and thought of everything to make our stay perfect. ",4,2023,09,13
216,Amazing - A Hidden Gem in Dublin!,"We booked this place based on the breakfast photos and boy did it deliver. Breakfast was delicious and plentiful everyday! We left wishing we had the recipe for their homemade cranberry bread. The service was also top notch all around. Our rooms were wonderful, and each had its own unique style that added to our trip. The lobby hangout area, honesty bar, and outdoor fireplace were all wonderful places to decompress after busy days exploring the city. 10/10 would recommend and would come back!!",5,2023,09,13
216,Amazing hotel and experience!,"This hotel was all I needed for my solo trip!!! Service was high standards, brilliant and lovely staff, always made sure I was comfortable, delicious breakfast, I would definitely come back and highly recommend this hotel for a unique experience in Dublin. Thank you!!!",5,2023,09,11
216,Awesome breakfast!  Spacious room!,"After 2 weeks in Ireland with breakfast with each hotel stay, Delia’s breakfast was one of the absolute best served.  Fresh fruit, French Press Coffee and a visit by Delia to ensure we were satisfied.  Delicious and of the highest quality.  Room 42 was Airconditioned and spacious.  Worth the climb!",5,2023,09,10
216,Fantastic Location & Delicious Breakfasts!,Fantastic location in Dublin near St. Stephens Green.  Cozy & comfortable rooms with large common areas & courtyard.  Excellent concierge service & absolutely Outstanding Breakfasts!  Have stayed her before & will stay here again!,5,2023,09,05
216,Perfection / highly recommend!,"Such attentive, kind staff. The room was comfy and lovely, the breakfast was some of the best food I ate in vacation. Would 100000% stay here again. It was also a pretty quiet location but convenient to anything you might need. ",5,2023,09,02
216,Perfect stay,"We stayed at Number 31 for our 20th wedding anniversary, where we had the most wonderful time.  

The service and care we received from Alvaro, Ehaim, Delia, Clara and Molly was excellent - they are a fantastic team.

The hotel is beautifully kept, drench in gorgeous details with a classy atmosphere. The courtyard is so lovely but sadly due to the rain we were not able to enjoy it more, but the indoor seating area was perfect, with a fireplace, coffee machine and (honesty) bar – very cool.

Our room was beautifully decorated too, very grand, and spacious with everything we needed and much more. The bed was big and so comfortable, so much so that we have already ordered the same pillows for our home! The room is bright with two large windows, facing the road, we didn’t have any issues with noise however, not sure if this would be different during the week as many building around are offices.

Delia’s breakfast was first class and one of the highlights of our stay. Fantastic choice, with the best ingredients cooked and presented with so much care and attention – very delicious. The tables are long and shared, no something we need experienced before but we did not find this a problem as there was plenty of room between guests, and everyone was nice. 

The hotel is located ten minutes stroll to some nice restaurants, pubs, and Saint Stephens Green where you can take a bus tours (many choices) and the local tram and buses. If you enjoy walking like we do, and you have access to a map then you can reach most of the attractions by foot. We walked from the hotel to the Guiness Store house and back, stopping at most of the tourist sights.

A taxi from the airport to the hotel took 45 minutes and cost us 30 Euros (each way)

We loved our stay at Number 31 and will definitely visit again! ",5,2023,08,29
216,Decent stay while in Dublin 10 to 15 minutes walk to the action.,"A mixed review.  The room we booked (Intimate Double) was small with small bathroom.  The room was a bit dated, but clean and totally acceptable for our stay.  The breakfast was wonderful and the staff was quite attentive.",4,2023,08,25
216,Hidden Gem,"I just stayed one night and wished it was longer. Such a beautiful hotel tucked away in a lovely neighborhood with a number of restaurants and coffee shops to choose from in walking distance. Gorgeous room, luxurious bedding, friendly, attentive staff and a fantastic home-cooked breakfast that will knock your socks off. I’m already thinking about my return. Thank you Number 31!!",5,2023,08,23
216,A GEM,"This is by far our favourite hotel in Dublin. Cosy, eccentric,  fantastic breakfast . Perfect location. Beds super comfy. We are so glad we found this hotel . Stayed 3 times already . Looking forward to our next visit.  Perfect 🥰 
",5,2023,08,21
216,Staying at Sam’s,"From the moment we entered through the Ivy-clad wooden door that brings you through a small garden to the reception area in the modern mews where we were welcomed by the Manager, it was an absolute pleasure staying at this unique hotel. Ray told us about the history of the property which incorporates both a Georgian townhouse and a 1950s mews building which was once the home of famed architect Sam Stephenson. I already knew about the sunken lounge but was unaware of the beautiful mirrored  bar tucked away in the corner. It was an “honesty” bar where you serve yourself with what drinks that are available and write a note of what you had and pay for this when checking out.  As the sun was shining we enjoyed our drinks in the garden which had a large fire pit for the cooler evenings. We had a very restful night in a jazz-themed room in the Georgian building. The Dyson cooling fan was a nice touch if needed. We could see our breakfast being freshly cooked from our communal table and the chef called Delia chatted with us afterwards. The  hospitality we experienced made it hard to leave Number 31. Looking forward to returning in the future. ",5,2023,08,11
216,Lovely small hotel in Dublin,"Great location!  Number 31 is easy walking distance to almost everywhere we wanted to go in Dublin, but in a quiet cul-de-sac.  There’s a lovely small garden and the breakfasts were excellent. I would definitely stay there again if I returned to DublIn.",5,2023,08,07
216,More like a Five Star Hotel,From the friendly Irish welcome to the modern and expensive finishes in the room this is one of the best kept secrets in Dublin.  Great value for money without compromising on quality.  The highlight certainly is the Breakfast with Delhi’s 5 star home made treat.  Fabulous ingredients with warm Irish service in a bright conservatory and Georgian Splendour.  What a fab experience.,5,2023,08,06
216,A Delightful Stay at my new Favorite Boutique Hotel in Dublin,"Highly Recommend!  I like to think of myself as the queen of boutique hotels and Number 31 definitely hit all the right notes. Nestled on a quiet side street Lesson Close, a few blocks from St Stephens Green. An ivy covered entrance leads to a sunken living room lobby with honor bar that feels like a cool art collector's private home.  The staff, especially general manger Mihai Cuhar, were incredibly welcoming and helpful. He went out of his way to make us feel special. My room upstairs in the converted carriage house was exactly what I needed after a long trip; quiet, comfortable size, nice amenities, a cuppa Barry's & a good bed. The main part of the hotel is a large Georgian townhouse with more stately rooms. Evening champagne chatting with other guests, great local restaurants, a few fun pubs, even a night club are right around the corner. Breakfast served in the pretty atrium was delicious. ",5,2023,08,05
216,Thought this would be great..but I was wrong,Hotel was not air conditioned.  My mistake for not checking.  Down comforters with no sheets so sleeping was hot.  No ventilation in the room or bathroom. No windows in the bathroom and lighting was so dark I spent a full 5 minutes looking for light switches because I thought there surely must be more lights. It was DARK in the bathroom. Seriously mood lighting dark. Imagine showering in a dark basement shower with the only light in the room coming from your iPhone flashlight and you’ll get a feel for this bathroom. No place to set your toiletries.  Even the hallways were dark. Couldn’t see the lock to get the key in the door.  The breakfast wasn’t good. I don’t like saying this because the people were very nice. But I’m am just being honest. I looked forward to the breakfast and it was a selling point. We were both very disappointed every day and it never improved.  The positives were the people and the courtyard area was very lovely.,3,2023,08,05
216,What a wonderful stay!,"Number 31 was fantastic and we will definitely stay here again! 

Staff were super friendly and helpful. 

Our room was lovely! It was cleaned everyday to a very high standard, as was the rest of number 31. 

Breakfast was lovely lots of choice and all very fresh. Will certainly miss my morning fruit salad. Staff at breakfast were helpful and had a big smile with their service. 

The outdoor area was beautiful, very well maintained and kept tidy. Gutted it rained most of our stay so was not able to use it.

It was truly a lovely hotel and was very impressed. It was a short walk to the canal, a park and even close to the centre! Can’t wait to come back!",5,2023,08,01
216,Georgian Dublin,Lovely facility with its Georgian architecture and quaint courtyard. The staff is most courteous and the breakfasts of excellent quality. The location is convenient to walk to the most popular sites in central Dublin and is close to St. Stephens Green.,5,2023,08,01
216,"Classy, Charming, and bursting with Character.","This hotel is one of the best we've ever stayed at. I can think of three C's that describe it perfectly: classy, character, and charm. It reminds us of the best hotels in Italy. Absolutely a must-stay and highly recommended. We will definitely stay here again.",5,2023,07,31
216,Number 31 is a DELIGHT!,"We were absolutely dazzled by Number 31.  The room was lovely, bed comfortable, and room 31 was decorated in art deco fashion. 

Breakfast was a surprise with fresh fruit, wonderful coffee and ordering off the menu which resulted in poached eggs on top of spinach and english muffins. 

The best part of staying at Number 31 was the wonderful staff and service.  Well done Number 31.  

Truly a wonderful surprise for our Dublin visit. 

NOTE:  The only bummer was the parking which we had to move our car three times to avoid ticketing.  ",5,2023,07,29
216,A piece of heaven,"What a beautiful hotel a little gem in the center of Dublin, fantastically decorated, cozy and the staff were extra friendly and so helpful. The breakfast was delicious and such a healthy menu. The next time I am in Dublin it will be the first hotel I look up. ",5,2023,07,28
216,30th wedding anniversary in Dublin,"My husband and I stayed at Number 31 for a total of 5 nights while in Ireland for our 30th wedding anniversary.  We absolutely loved everything about our stay here and would definitely plan on staying at Number 31 when in Dublin again.  The location is perfect - we walked everywhere and it is a short walk to the airport bus stop.  It is quiet, peaceful and immaculate.  The best part is the breakfast!  When we arrived before 7AM on our first day, tired from traveling all night, we were immediately warmly welcomed in and had breakfast made for us.  Every morning breakfast was a delicious delight and we met lots of wonderful fellow travelers.  Delia is so special as well as the rest of the staff and left us with so many wonderful memories.  ",5,2023,07,17
216,Great boutique hotel.,"A really great little hotel.  Location is ideal -- a quiet neighborhood within walking distance of great restaurants and almost everything you'd want to visit in Dublin.  King room (""Fabulous Double"") was roomy and elegant.  Nice outdoor courtyard.  Great honor bar in the pleasant lobby area.  Great breakfast, served indoors and out.  ",5,2023,07,17
216,Fantastic experience,"We absolutely loved our time here. The room was huge, the staff was incredibly friendly, the breakfast was sooo delicious - I could go on, but everything was amazing and I recommend Number 31 to anyone! ",5,2023,07,16
216,Fantastic Stay!,"Just returning home after a four night stay at Number 31 and what a stay it was, the staff were all so lovely and helpful and a big shout out to Delia for her amazing breakfasts, don’t know how we’re going to manage at home without her! The hotel is in a great location, a very pleasant walk along the canal to either the Luas or Dart stations. We will definitely return to Dublin and Number 31!",5,2023,07,13
216,Delights Abound!,Lovely two night stay in the quirky yet chic Georgian townhome connected by a charming garden courtyard to the main retro 1960s style former mews (stables).

216,Charming and Comfortable Accommodations - Look No Further!,"Best overnight experience in Dublin to date. In fact, I'm a little hesitant to spread the word too much about this hidden gem. Number 31 made us feel welcome from the moment we stepped into their charming hotel. The pillows and bedding were so comfy (and I'm picky about my pillows) and the breakfast was amazing! We loved the family atmosphere including the honor bar. The lobby was a cozy place to gather for this family of five. I would not hesitate to stay again! Thanks Number 31! ",5,2023,07,11
216,Exceeding our expectations ,"Fabulous hotel with excellent attention to detail across all staff members through check in to breakfast with Delia and Molly. While waiting for our room to be ready, we were given complimentary Prosecco in the beautiful courtyard garden. The rooms were spacious with gorgeous voya spa products included. Highly recommend Number 31 and will definitely be back!! ",5,2023,07,09
216,Amazing stay and we can’t wait to return!,"Our stay here was amazing! The location is perfect and walking distance to everything (the Guinness Factory, Grafton Street, Temple Bar, amazing restaurants and cafes), the room didn’t feel like a hotel but rather a fancy, huge, and welcoming room in a mansion, the decor is beautiful and unique (they were even changing out all the art in the lobby during our stay!), and the staff was friendly and accommodating— when we had to leave by 7:30am for a full day tour, we told them the night before and they served us an early breakfast before the normal opening time. We will definitely be back!",5,2023,07,09
216,"The Best Hotel Experience in Dublin | Aesthetics, Amenities + Customer Service","I would be hard-pressed to believe there is a more enjoyable hotel stay in Dublin - maybe in all of Europe. Number 31 delivers in so many ways. The secret garden atmosphere when you enter makes it feel like you discovered an exclusive secret oasis in the heart of Dublin. Walking in to the lobby you are wowed by the architecture and design aesthetic. The staff could not be more friendly and accommodating. There is an ""Honesty Bar"" for cocktails, wine and beer which is self-serve and so convenient. The room we stayed in was breathtaking as was the entire building. The level of design was jaw-dropping and the quality of the bed, the furniture and the bathroom was top tier. Every amenity was considered to give the stay that added level of luxury. In-room coffee or espresso, lovely scented lotions, soaps and sprays. Robes, hair-dryers, plush towels and a seductive chandelier put it over the top. As if this weren't enough, the food offered was some of the best we discovered in Ireland. The friendly staff provide an incredible spread of fresh-squeezed juice, fresh-pressed coffee, yogurt, bread, pastry and more. The breakfast we ordered after that was delicious! Expertly prepared and full of flavor. Our stay wasn't long enough and there is no doubt we will return here again and again whenever our travels bring us to Dublin. Do not miss your chance to stay here!",5,2023,07,06
216,"Number 31, A Glamorous Respite in Dublin",Number 31 stunned us with old Hollywood decor and style. The immaculate room was well appointed with everything you could need. The breakfast was set in a sunny garden room and spoiled us with scrumptious fare including a remarkable vegan riff on an Irish Breakfast. It was delectable!   The hotel also boasts an honor bar that allows folks to mix a drink in a 1920s style mirrored glamour bar. Huzzah!,5,2023,07,06
216,Top class,The most pleasant stay.  Staff are so friendly and helpful.  Beautiful decor and atmosphere.  The beds and pillows are the most comfiest ever.  Would highly recommend and look forward to visiting again.,5,2023,06,28

I loved every minute of our stay from check-in to the beautiful decor & grounds to the spacious room to the delicious breakfast every morning. Thank you to the entire staff for making our stay so lovely. Cheers and I look forward to returning one day and referring my friends & family!,5,2023,06,27
216,Elegant and homely,I have stayed in no31 many times and will always come back. Staff are so helpful and special mention for Delia! And her amazing breakfast. Rooms are comfortable although the intimate double could do with a new window that opens more. The garden is beautiful as is the seating pit- hope it never changes!,5,2023,06,23
216,Good find in Dublin,Beautiful boutique B&B and a great location with a short walk into the centre of Dublin.  We were on the top floor and there is no lift which was quite challenging!  Breakfast was good and plenty of choice.  Room was spacious and very comfortable,5,2023,06,13
216,"Great breakfast, staff not the best","A lovely, quiet hotel-meets-BnB. Breakfast was fab and the bed comfy. Really nice lounge and outdoor area. Unfortunately room was a bit dirty (needed a good dust). Staff didn't know basic things like where to catch a bus, and also the guy at reception left out a list of all the guests and their room numbers on the desk for anyone to see - which is a pretty bad breach of private data! Aside from that, it's a very pleasant stay and easy to get around Dublin from the hotel.",4,2023,06,11
216,Fabulous,"We very much enjoyed this unique accommodation. The staff were very friendly and welcoming, room was clean and unique. I love the pillow spray and have been using it to freshen up the rooms of other hotels we’ve been staying at on our trip around Ireland. 
Breakfast was fantastic! So good we are coming back at the end of our trip!
Hotel is walkable to a lot of attractions",5,2023,06,10
216,A special place!,We stayed in room 15 which is a huge family room. It was luxurious. The sunken lobby is lovely. The staff all went out of their way to be helpful and welcoming. Delia and her gourmet breakfasts are truly special. She was so kind and we enjoyed our visits with her. We hope to return to this special hotel!,5,2023,05,30
216,Fantastic Service,The service was excellent. Every member of the staff really went out of their way to make our stay as comfortable as possible. We really liked the location - it was away from the hustle and bustle of the city center but we were able to walk to most locations with ease. We would certainly stay again. ,4,2023,05,26
216,Recommend you stay here if visiting Dublin City Centre,A great location. Very welcoming and all staff were extremely nice and helpful. My room was compact but very comfortable with all the necessities and some nice extras provided. Breakfast was delicious  ,5,2023,05,22
216,Fabulous stay,"Fabulous experience from start to finish, special place in a great location. The room was lovely and the bed  was extremely comfortable. A freshly cooked breakfast with fabulous fresh ingredients was the best I’ve ever had . Staff lovely and helpful too. Highly recommended 

",5,2023,05,10
216,Wonderfully Stylish Retreat!,"My husband & I recently had an absolutely wonderful stay at Number 31! This was our second time booking with them and I am happy to say that they did not disappoint. This boutique hotel boasts a perfect location, close to all that Dublin has to offer, yet still remains a quiet oasis. The decor is quite stylish, charming and a bit quirky. If you love luxurious art deco style, you will be in heaven! Our room was spacious and clean. The beds were comfy and the shower had strong water pressure. There was a lovely hidden courtyard and an honesty bar as well. The staff were all welcoming and friendly, happy to help. And let me tell you about the breakfasts - just perfection! Freshly squeezed orange juice, home baked bread and a plentiful assortment of entrees - all cooked to order. One of the best breakfasts we have enjoyed ever! We are planning another trip to Dublin soon and would not dream of staying any other place.",5,2023,05,09
216,Oasis in central Dublin,"Better than expected. Nice decoration with lots of attention to detail. High quality materials, e.g. in the bathroom. Very good soaps and cosmetic products, even the cushion got scented with a discreet lavender linen perfume! Front desk staff were all helpful and friendly, as were other staff we've met. Breakfast deserves a special mention - all fresh, served at the table and of truly exceptional quality - a good way of starting your day. The location is good for Dublin city centre - a mere 10 minute walk from St. Stephens Green.",5,2023,05,08
216,Great stay at Number 31,"The room was beautiful (as was the whole place) and the bed very comfortable. The location was excellent - quiet, but easy walking distance to the main city areas. Staff were friendly and helpful. The highlight, though, was the breakfasts. Loads of choice, all freshly cooked and absolutely delicious. Would highly recommend!",5,2023,05,04
216,One of the best stays ever,An absolutely outstanding place to stay at the heart of Dublin. The professionalism of a large hotel combined with the personal touches of a family-run business - this really is the sweet spot. The rooms are comfortable and beautifully decorated and maintained. The breakfast was the best we’ve ever had in a hotel. If you often opt for the reassurance of a corporate hotel but fancy trying something with far more character then this is for you. ,5,2023,05,01
216,Great food and location,Really enjoyed our time here. The staff were incredibly friendly and attentive. The breakfasts were spectacular and the cook was always concerned you were satisfied. The only complaint would be our room was on the bottom floor and the room above was quite squeaky when anyone walked. We didn’t complain as it was only a couple of times in the evening and then a couple of times in the morning.  We loved the location as there were almost no street noises and we weren’t in the bustle of the city but could walk to the center in 20 minutes. We really enjoyed our visit. ,5,2023,05,01
216,Perfect place for a birthday celebration ,"This place really is a little bit of Heaven on earth!! If you want something that is not the run of the mill hotel/B&B then this place is for you. A 1920’s inspired place with oodles of charm and quirky decor. The rooms are clean, exquisitely comfortable and we could not have wanted more.

On to breakfast….Auntie Delia and her staff are truly amazing!! Nothing is too much trouble, the food….just beautiful and the full Irish is not to be missed. 

An amazing place that made my 50th birthday more perfect than I could have imagined! ",5,2023,04,27
216,Delia’s Breakfast,Delia’s breakfast is outstanding and made even better by her delightful personality. The staff is very attentive and the service is just as quick or relaxed as you need it to be.  There is a great variety to choose from. Makes you dream of extending your stay or returning soon.,5,2023,04,25
216,Hotel Masquerading as Air B&B,"Funky hotel made up of old Georgian houses in the center of Dublin with virtually no services
Good: Room had interesting decor, comfortable bed and pillows.  Breakfast was excellent
Not so good:  Charged credit card for the first night TWO days prior to arrival and charged the remaining on the day of check in.   Used Covid 19 as excuse not to clean rooms unless requested.  (How long are hotels going to use this excuse to reduce their operating expenses?).  Room carpet wasn't vacuumed daily.  Single pane windows were not sufficient to keep road noise from waking us early.    Thought we would be staying in a building in the mews depicted on the website and not a building on a main road.  
In short, I personally felt that I didn't have a hotel experience.  I would have had more for my money if I had stayed in an Air B&B in the center of town.  ",2,2023,04,21
216,Stay in the heart of Dublin,"Excellent. Lovely comfortable room. We did have to climb a few flights of stairs but the staff had kindly put our luggage up beforehand.  Friendly, helpful staff and beautiful fresh breakfast.  We also managed to get one of the parking spaces which was a bonus",5,2023,04,08
216,Great place to stay in Dublin,"The location is very convenient. Close to everything, but on a quiet street.
All the staff were friendly and helpful.
The room was beautifully decorated, well stocked with all you may need. The bed was extremely comfortable and it was quiet.
The lounge, where there is an honesty bar, is very cosy and welcoming.
The garden is lovely and secluded.
The breakfast, prepared by Delia, was delicious and served in a great breakfast area.
We will not hesitate to return to Number 31 when we are next in Dublin.
I will be recommending it to friends.
Thank you.
",5,2023,04,07
216,A beautiful gem in the heart of Dublin,"Stayed for one night, know the location reasonably well but hadn't come across this oasis before.
We were staying just for one night, attending a. Wedding in the equally gorgeous 25 Fitzwilliam just accross the road.
Lucky to secure a parking space outside, on the quiet lane, into reception and effortless check in. Arrived early, room not ready to occupy and luggage taken care of for us.
Room 42, a beautiful and tasteful room. Plenty of space, sumptuous bed, quiet and spotless. On to breakfast in the morning and an amazing breakfast.  Staff were so helpful and engaging. Lovely chat with Ray  as we checked out.
It's now our go to place in Dublin. Love it! ",5,2023,04,07
216,Amazing service and amazing food!,"We had a 7 hr layover from Canada and found Number 31 for breakfast off the street.

They were super accommodating for breakfast service despite having a full house that day. 5/5

The food itself was amazing. We never had fruit jam that fresh and amazing before. The eggs and sausage were delicious! Freshly squeezed orange juice and traditional porridge were also amazing. 

It was an amazing pick-me-up after a long flight and layover. Very glad we came to Number 31 and we hope to stay here for accommodations the next time we are in Dublin.",5,2023,04,04
216,Boutique hotel in Dublin,"Stunning hotel with a hidden garden and honesty bar just 5 minutes from Stephen's Green. The rooms in the Georgian house are beautifully appointed and very comfortable.
The staff were extremely knowledgeable and helpful and made our stay even more enjoyable. Special mention to the extremely talented and generous Delia; her legendary breakfasts did not disappoint.
Perfect base for a few days in beautiful Dublin.",5,2023,04,02
216,A true gem - so delighted I found Number 31.,"Number 31 is possibly the most unique place I have ever stayed - this is a hotel that is so lovingly curated and staffed  - truly stunning and if you like Georgian style, Art Deco, or have a theatrical flair, you will be in heaven!  The courtyard garden is a refuge from the city - absolutely beautiful to sit and read, or enjoy a drink from the honesty bar.  For me, this was the perfect location - along Embassy Row and very close to the gorgeous St. Stephens Green - it felt safe and quiet (I was traveling alone and walk a lot at all hours) and was near a number of fantastic places to eat and drink (I had a wonderful dinner at The Old Spot).  Also a shout out to the young, very kind and attentive staff - they were so sweet and so helpful  - I felt very comfortable asking for assistance.  My room was comfortable and beautiful - like stepping into another world.  This hotel provides so much  - including the delicious, gorgeous breakfast - bravo!",5,2023,03,31
216,Hidden Gem,"What a hidden gem, great location close to city centre. Had a wonderful sleep, in lovely surroundings.  Breakfast was perfect, in a spotless dining room. The honesty bar was great for a nightcap. Would definitely stay here again.",5,2023,03,31

The area around guest house is very nice we felt safe walking around in the evening.staff are friendly and helpful would recommend to other seeking a dublin weekend or longer stay,5,2023,03,23
216,Worth the visit ,"Location is great, the whole atmosphere is fantastic, loved the room, but the shower was a bit small. But that was made up for with the breakfast, which is second to none. The main building is such a treat to art deco",4,2023,03,22
216,Excellent,"Very polite, friendly and helpful staff. Chilled out atmosphere in the hotel (honesty bar to boot) and as good a breakfast as you'll get anywhere. I will definitely stay there again and will recommend to friends also :)",5,2023,03,21
216,Friends in Dublin,Fabulous place to stay room was gorgeous bed so comfortable. Lovely amenities in room and a complimentary candle left for us was a beautiful touch! Breakfast was delicious. Will definitely stay again. ,5,2023,03,16
216,Gem of a hotel.,Would highly recommend No 31. Room was spotless. Bed was really comfortable. Great shower. Cant say enough about the breakfast. Everything cooked fresh. All the staff in reception and at breakfast are very pleasant.  We managed to get a car parking spot which was very handy. We were going to a concert in the National Concert Hall so it was only a 6 min walk from the hotel. Stephens green and Grafton street are only short walk away.  ,5,2023,03,07
216,Completely heartless,Showed a complete lack of sympathy when I couldn't travel due the unexpected death of my mother.  They flat refused to either refund or transfer the booking to another date.  As I regularly travel to Dublin will simply stay elsewhere in the future.,1,2023,03,07
216,"Lovely boutique hotel, breakfast incredible","Stayed in intimate double room 43 recently. The beautifully decorated room was at top of several flights of stairs but away from noise of Fitzwilliam Street below. Would recommend booking room with garden view if you are a light sleeper. Toiletries topped up daily,Voya ... beautiful smells. Delia's breakfasts from 07:30 were absolutely fantastic. My wife had Eggs Florentine every day whilst I had omelette with bacon. This was accompanied with luscious fresh fruit salad and an assortment of home made breads. Delia's food is the absolute highlight of a delightful stay. We had a memorable time and hope to return before too long.",5,2023,03,06
216,"A great residence in a super location, with an epic breakfast!","No. 31 is my goto place to stay in Dublin.  It's a converted big Georgian house with a more modern annex across the courtyard that has an interesting architectural heritage. The rooms are really lovely, super comfortable beds and good amenities with a cosy luxe art deco vibe (in the Georgian part). Service is attentive without being overbearing and the staff are always friendly and helpful in my experience. Although breakfast is the only meal on offer, it is a particular highlight; delicious fresh ingredients prepared by lovely Delia who really looks after her guests.  Whether you want a full cooked breakfast or a bowl of fruit and yogurt, Delia will fix it!  No. 31 has real character. ",5,2023,03,03
216,Such a Special Spot,"Totally flawless experience :) Everyone who works there is lovely, helpful and the it feels like a very special spot. The breakfast is also AMAZING, if you are wondering whether or not to add the breakfast to your stay, I can say it is fully worth it. ",5,2023,03,03
216,Little gem in Dublin,Number 31 is a little gem located in the Georgian chic area of Dublin. The rooms are well equipped and the decoration is stunning. But what makes the charm is definitely the staff. The reception team is very welcoming and always keen to help you to discover the city. The must is the breakfast cooked by Delia. Every morning it’s a real pleasure to eat homemade food. Delia was very kind and always try to have a quick chat with every guest whenever she could. We definitely recommend Number 31 hôtel whenever you visit Dublin.,5,2023,02,28
216,Beautiful oasis,"Stayed in the beautiful Number 31 last night, from my first arrival to leaving it was fabulous. The friendly welcome from the receptionist was lovely. The room I stayed in, room 11, was lovely. The decoration of the room is really nice, the bed very comfortable and even a little garden! Plus the Barry’s Tea in the room was a nice touch for this Cork man!
Breakfast was so tasty, I had a bowl of really fresh fruits, followed by the best eggs Benedict I have ever had! The freshly squeezed OJ was so tasty! Friendly wait staff and a really warm welcome! I can’t wait to visit again!",5,2023,02,24
216,Superb,We stayed here for a rugby game- we will definitely be back. An absolutely stunning place with an amazing breakfast and such lovely staff. They were courteous enough to mind our luggage pre check in and recommended a lovely local restaurant for lunch!,5,2023,02,13
216,LOVED this place!,"We did just one night in Dublin at Number 31 but would have loved to stay longer. We were worried about parking but they seem to have about six spots there and we were able to grab one. They have a darling sunken common area with fireplace and bar. Our family had a precious happy hour there when we arrived. The breakfast is to-die-for. Really gourmet with lots of choices. I lost my glasses and was really desperate. They found them and had them at the desk! Location is great. Walk out and north and go through St. Stephens Green, the walking street area, and then Trinity College. All perfectly wonderful.",5,2023,02,12
216,A definite for a stay over in the city,"This is an absolute gem of an oasis in Dublin. We'll worth the visit. From the moment you arrive you are made feel special by the most customer focused staff I have come across they are a credit to this establishment.

216,Spot on; most perfect,"Stayed here for a short break on our first ever trip to Dublin. 
What a great place to stay at; we were so well looked after.  Building and grounds interesting; staff most friendly, knowledgeable and very helpful; Delia and her breakfasts are truly an institution.
We stayed in Sam's room. Spacious and quirky complete with a sunken bath.  No window but a roof light.
Location is perfect: an easy walk into the centre and on a direct bus route out from the airport.
",5,2023,02,05
216,Weekend in Dublin,"We spent a wonderful weekend in Dublin in Number 31. We loved the place.

216,Top notch accommodation in the centre of Dublin,"We stayed in a really lovely room for 4 adults - plenty of space, tea & coffee, Voya products and a huge TV. Very cool public space to hang out by the gas fire. Truly fab breakfast. The most ideal location. Had a great sleep too!",5,2023,02,02
216,City Break,Stunning residence to stay in . We felt we were in such a quiet and spectacular venue away from everything. Walk out the Front  door and your five mins walk from everything  Dublin has to offer . We received a Fantastic Welcome and standard of room is Five Star. Breakfast was one of the best. Delicious !,5,2023,01,31
216,What a marvelous experience!!,"From the moment we stepped into the property to the moment we left we encountered the most professional, warm, helpful, attentive and friendly staff. We wish we had taken note of each of their names!
The room was beautiful, super spacious, clean and comfortable! The bathroom was clean and huge! My children were amazed by the details of the cleaning staff who “made a bed” for our toothbrushes!
Chef Delia’s breakfast was to die for! Everything was delicious, fresh and big portions! Unfortunately, we were able to savor her art only one morning as we had to leave at 6am the next day, but Chef Delia and the gentleman in the front desk made sure we had a continental breakfast far better than any other continental breakfasts and helped us secure the taxis to the airport!
We wish we could stay longer! We loved Number 31 and we will come back whenever we come to Dublin!",5,2023,01,29
216,Wonderful hotel...wonderful staff,"The Number 31 was one of the nicest establishments we have stayed in many years.  Not only is the meticulously restored Georgian Townhouse a visual treat, it is comfortable like home.....made possible by engaged employees like Agatha and Mihai.  Combined with its fantastic location, No. 31 really deserves six stars.",5,2023,01,29
216,Just perfect!,I could sum No 31 up in one word - Perfect! From start to finish we were so well looked after by the staff; the rooms are beautifully decorated (we had a plush double); Delia's breakfast was the best we have ever had - you just have to go and try it! (from her homemade walnut/cranberry bread; porridge; granola; full Irish) all were the best of ingredients made/cooked to perfection. Thank you to all at No 31  with a special thanks to the lovely Agatha at reception. We can't wait to return!,5,2023,01,22
216,Couldn't recommend more!,"The hotel is gorgeous, and so close to everything in the city. The room was clean and spacious and super quiet. The staff were so lovely, even putting the fire pit on just for us to experience! The courtyard and conversation pit are great cozy communal spaces. Breakfast was so delicious, I'd recommend eating in the conservatory as the atmosphere was great. A wonderful experience overall, so cozy and gorgeous, will definitely stay again! ",5,2023,01,07
216,Great find!!,Number 31 was wonderful!!  Pictures do not do it justice.  We stayed in the building opposite of the lobby in a wonderfully spacious room and very well decorated.  Delia’s breakfast was AMAZING!  All of the staff were exceptionally friendly and welcoming.  Thank you for a great stay while we were in Dublin.,5,2023,01,02
216,Amazing time in Dublin & Number 31,"This was our first trip to Dublin. We absolutely loved Number 31! There are 2 houses. The house with the lobby and sunken in living area and bar. And then the other house (the townhouse) with nothing but sleeping rooms. Depending on the room type that you get, determines which house you get. Our room was located in the townhouse away from the lobby area. Loved it. Super quiet. 

Both houses were previously homes, so rooms are different and not a typical hotel. Almost feels like a large B&B because you also get breakfast prepared by Delia. Guests go to breakfast and have an amazing personalized breakfast prepared by Delia. You have a menu and Delia cooks your order. And it's amazing. French press coffee, freshly squeezed OJ. etc. Our ONLY complaint, was that because of our agenda, we could only do breakfast one day. We were SO disappointed as Delia somehow managed to cook and prepare everybody's breakfast to perfection, even though she was cooking everyone's at the same time. We wanted to be able to do breakfast every morning. 

On our last day, we couldn't make the breakfast, but they gave us a continental breakfast as it was just before the time they served breakfast. It was just enough to get us to the airport. 

The staff was incredibly helpful and delightful. We sent emails to the hotel ahead of time, and they answered every one of them. 

I recommend Matt the Thresher down the street for dinners.

We would absolutely stay here again, and don't miss breakfast and Delia. She was like the Irish mother we didn't have!",5,2023,01,01
216,Old fashioned with the modern service,"Good location off lesson street but limited parking of 4 spaces. Rooms are beautifully decorated in an Art Deco style. Hotel is a converted Old Style Georgian Dublin house. Ideal if you looking for something a bit different than the modern hotel.
We stayed in Room 21 which was bigger than some. Rooms have water & good coffee facilities. Shower was great.
Staff were very friendly 
Breakfast is cooked to order and was amazing.",5,2022,12,22
216,If in Dublin stay here.,"First time staying here and our only disappointment was for one night only. We were impressed. It was warm and welcoming, peaceful and quit. within walking distance city centre. Staff were helpful and friendly. The bedroom large and comfortable. The breakfast was lovely with a wide menu. If you are staying in Dublin and don't want a big bustling hotel, stay here we will be.",5,2022,12,21
216,Amazing breakfast!,"Stylish hotel. A little bit out of the way. Large room with very comfy bed. The best part of the stay was definately the breakfast! Made to order with lots of choices.

The tap in the bathroom was leaking and we hade some issues with the reception when ordering a taxi to the airport (largely depending on the very cold weather) so that makes me give a 4 and not a 5.",4,2022,12,21
216,Great stay in Dublin.  ,"A warm welcome, friendly service and great home cooked food are the order of the day at No31, not to mention the stylish and comfortable  accommodation itself.    I couldn't recommend it more highly.    ",5,2022,12,13
216,Beautiful boutique hotel,"Beautiful cosy boutique hotel with great service - Agatha gave us such a friendly welcoming on arrival. We had a plush double which was very spacious, the bed was so comfy. Well situated and very easy to get the Air Coach to and from Dunlin airport. Thank you!

The only complaint is 10am seems early to finish breakfast, especially at the weekend, and Deliah seemed very unhappy if you arrived at 9.55!",5,2022,12,12
216,Mary Fennelly,"Stayed in 31 .two rooms. Location fabulous. The best breakfast I have had in a long time. All freshly cooked. 5 star hotel standard. Cranberry and walnut bread, a bit hit along with eggs Benedict.  Thanks to Delia the chef.",5,2022,12,10
216,A wonderful place to stay ,"A really lovely place to stay . My room was great very very comfortable just right. The young staff were as kind helpful friendly efficient as you could possibly wish . It’s really central perfect for exploring Dublin. They are on a mission to make you feel at home and they succeed .
The breakfasts though are the star attraction . Cooked by Delia who is a delight and the best breakfasts  I have ever had . Incomparable. Really superb produce cooked to perfection not a single flaw . Stunning ..thank you so much I’m coming back ",5,2022,12,08
216,What a gem,"We booked this last minute midweek because we were bought due in town early the next morning. But I have to say what a find. The style is all done in an amazing art deco vibe.... really cool and never saw anything like it to compare.  The features in the room and the high ceilings were beautiful. 
A lovely feature of a fire lit fountain in the courtyard added and a really cosy feel to the place. 
The chef, I think her name is Delia brought my breakfast out to the table which i thought was pretty cool. Options on the menu were fantastic and although I 'only' opted for porridge, it may have been the nicest I have ever had. 
Met a John and Clara that really looked after us. I cannot wait to find an excuse to stay in this hotel again.",5,2022,12,06
216,Excellent Location in Dublin,"From the moment we arrived we felt most welcome and comfortable. Reception staff very helpful and friendly during our 4 night stay. The cooked to order breakfast is as good as all the rave reviews. The entire hotel was extremely clean.
The location is far enough from the crowds yet easy walking distance to many attractions and restaurants. Our room in the Georgian townhouse section was quite and helpful to have an exit out to Fitzwilliam Place. Wish we could have enjoyed the beautiful garden and patios, but not for November weather!",5,2022,12,04
216,Disappointed with Response to Room Problem,"I would love to give this B&B a great review - some great staff and excellent breakfasts. However, we ran into an issue on our last night. My family and I booked 3 rooms for 2 nights. On the second night, my daughter and her husband experienced an issue with a blower fan in their room - kept recycling every 5 minutes with a significant noise. They contacted the night clerk who came to the room to take a look at the problem. He verified the issue but could not fix it; and unfortunately, could not move them to another room. Suffice to say, they had a terrible night with no sleep. We checked out that next morning, reported the issue to the assistant on duty. I contacted the General Manager that following morning via email, summarizing the issue and attaching a short video showing the problem. The GM apologized and offered to comp some drinks and extend a 10% discount on future stays. I responded with a request to issue a refund / credit for that room night. I believe that's fair given the circumstances.  
Update after 2 months:  The hotel is refusing to issue a credit so it’s now our credit card company battling it out. That's unfortunate.  I was hopeful a business of this stature would stand by its commitment to superior customer service and do the right thing…",1,2022,12,02
216,Disappointed,"I visited recently and was so looking  forward to my stay. 
The hotel looks impressive at the entrance. The sunken bar area by reception is excellent as is the honesty bar. 

My room, number 10, looked very impressive on first site but sadly there are issues. You constantly hear banging doors from the main entrance as fellow guests return through the night. 
The net curtains provide little privacy from your fellow guests as they walk past your room to the front door of the hotel. 
The major issue was that the door to your exclusive ground floor balcony (really a cordoned off bit of the entrance path) had its access door left  unlocked before my arrival. I didn’t check the door. Well, you wouldn’t would you, expecting the upmost security and attention to detail from all who look after this hotel. So the first I had slept in a room with an accessible door to the entrance. 

The breakfast is excellent. The lady chef is superb with excellent service and customer approach. I’m less keen on the refectory style tables. On our first day, there weren’t enough seats for us all. 

Would I stay here again? No. There are better places in Dublin which have better service and attention to detail than Number 31.",2,2022,11,24
216,Adorable hotel ,So glad that I choose this hotel in Dublin! What an adorable hotel with unique rooms and a view of the courtyard. The hotel staff was amazing and accommodating. I also thoroughly enjoyed the breakfast as it was especially yummy 💚,5,2022,11,23
216,Beautiful building but the staff are the star.,"Definitely not your carbon copy hotel. From the outside at night the only visible bit of this unique hotel is the lighted gate. Once through this gate you enter into a beautiful little courtyard and the first of the two buildings that make up this hotel. 
Reception is a simple affair, tucked away out of sight behind a fireplace overlooking the sunken lounge. 
I stayed in the Georgian building which is located across another courtyard from reception. The room was large and beautifully decorated. All modern conveniences present but not in any way detracting from the historical features of the room. 
Despite its size the room was wonderfully warm and cosy, no mean feat in November. Nice quality bedding helped enhance this feeling of comfort, I slept like a baby. 
Breakfast was another lovely surprise. The moment I sat down the staff placed homemade bread with jams, fresh orange juice and a large fruit salad in front of me. The breakfast menu covers all the bases and staff are very accommodating to requests. 
Which brings me to the very best part of this hotel - the people who work there. I stay in hotels a lot and rarely have I met such a genuinely warm and welcoming group. They were extremely helpful and very efficient and from the interactions I witnessed appeared to enjoy working together.
I can’t wait to stay again.",5,2022,11,23
216,Fabulous stay! Highly recommend,"We randomly stumbled upon Number 31 on TripAdvisor and decided to take a chance, that certainly paid off! We stayed two nights in a plush double. The room was gorgeous- beautiful decor, super comfy bed. The staff were friendly and very accommodating. Delia’s breakfast was absolutely delicious!! Made to order, fresh, tasty, and set us up for the day. We loved every minute of our visit and would happily have stayed longer. We highly recommend this hidden gem in a great location. Looking forward to returning! Thank you for a wonderful stay.",5,2022,11,17
216,You will fall in love with this place!,"My wife and I stayed for five nights in November 2022. Great location in the heart of Dublin, unique period details, warm friendly service, and Delia's Irish breakfast – to die for! Our room was small, but very cozy and well appointed.",5,2022,11,17
216,Excellent Choice For City Center,"A wonderful, hidden gem. Convenient to downtown and the City center, we felt safe coming and going ( at ALL hours) in this fantastic location. Rooms were so comfortable, we fell asleep as soon as our heads hit the pillows. The staff were wonderful and accommodating  as well.

The real highlight is the breakfast included at Delia’s upstairs!  The food was fantastic and fresh.  Choices ranged from a full Irish to eggs Benedict to frittatas, plus a fresh variety of sliced breads, orange juice, and tea or coffee.  What an absolute delight to start each day with the smiling young ladies on the staff!  They welcomed us with a smile three early mornings in a row and the service could not be found wanting in he slightest.  A definite highlight of our Dublin visit (I recommend the eggs Benedict). What is I. The fried potato mash? Pure magic!",5,2022,11,14
216,Would advise avoiding,"Stayed here recently on a trip to Dublin. Horrid place. Tiny bedroom. Damp, tiny bathroom. Don't stay here if you want to sleep as there was loud noise all night from the road. Was staying in the attic on the fourth floor with no lift. Food was poor. Management was rude. Avoid.",1,2022,11,02
216,Number 31 is a GEM in Dublin!,"We wanted to share a gem of a special hotel in a victorian townhouse within walking distance of the heart of Dublin.  We LOVED our time there and the entire Number 31 family made us feel so welcomed all throughout our stay.  From the moment you arrive, they welcome you and help you with your luggage.  Number 31 is a victorian townhouse and so well-appointed with art deco pieces and wonderful art.  There is an unique area right, when you enter, where you can sit and relax and talk and it is so cozy.

We had special help from the general manager, Mihai and all in reception--thank you Agata, Clara, Dana and Marina! You made us feel at home every moment and helped us with all of our tourist questions. We looked forward to Delia's homemade Irish breakfast each morning...Delia has been there for many years and everything coming out of her kitchen is delicious! Luiza, Mary and Ciara are Delia's right hand angels who make all go right for a wonderful breakfast.

If we ever return to Dublin, we will definitely stay at Number 31....it is a gem in an amazing city.  We hope you will have this opportunity as well.
Cheers!

216,Very cool ambience and great location,"We were in the Georgian building across a beautiful courtyard.  The courtyard itself was worth spending time in and we did.  The room was tastefully done in a ""roaring 20's"" motif.  No problems at all with the necessities, electricity, etc.  The location of the place is ideal to get downtown and there are great dining options very close (House Dublin is a few doors away, hidden gem).  Parking is quite limited but staff was very accommodating for us especially as we arrived at 5 am!",5,2022,10,24
216,"Amazing hotel, fantastic experience!","Our stay at No. 31 was at least as much of a highlight as the event we were going to that evening. So comfortable, so amazingly decorated, with beautiful surroundings and such lovely staff.
I had read great reviews of the breakfast, created by the famous Delia, and I can very strongly confirm that Delia deserves all the praise!
Lovely food, and very friendly service. We met Delia, as she came out of the kitchen to check that everyone was OK. A true lady who takes great pride in her work, and obviously works very hard.
No. 31 is a treat, I am from Dublin and live in the outskirts of Dublin but we will be back. My most favourite hotel after a long list of hotel stays!",5,2022,10,23
216,Cute boutique hotel,I almost gave this hotel 5 stars  It is a beautiful boutique hotel with interesting art work.  The staff goes above and beyond to accommodate guests.  We requested a room change because my wife had a knee problem and were promptly shown a couple of other rooms to choose from.  The breakfast is cooked onsite with several delicious selections.  An honor bar was a nice touch.  The hotel itself was warm and cozy with a beautiful outdoor area to enjoy a drink or fresh air.  It is a slight walk to the center of town which we did but Uber was also helpful.  Beautiful place to enjoy Dublin.,4,2022,10,20
216,"Fantastic hotel, Amazing service",My wife and I stayed for two nights for our 26th anniversary.   Service was amazing from everyone. We received an upgraded room without asking.    Many thanks to Delia for her personal attention and best Irish breakfast in Ireland!,5,2022,10,19
216,Best stay ever!,"I needed a place to put myself and my mother up for the night and this hotel was so quaint! 
-their self service bar and seating area is so comfortable yet extremely sheek 
-upstairs breakfast was fantastic! Authentic breads with cream and jam, pots of tea, all inclusive menu (GF, vegetarian) home cooked for you right next to you!
-only downside we had was they do not have an elevator in their facility but we are both pretty fit so we gladly took the extra exercise! 
THANK YOU Mihai, we will be back!!!",5,2022,10,18
216,Amazing hotel a hidden gem! ,We stayed a few nights for my 40th and had the intimate double room. Although small we were barely there as off seeing the sights so it was perfect for what we needed. Location was great and everywhere was easy to get to mainly by foot. The room was lovely and clean and the bed and pillows were so comfortable! The only trouble we had was a dodgy toilet seat in the bathroom. The staff were very friendly and helpful. They even called us on the last morning to check if we wanted breakfast as we hadn’t been! I had heard the breakfast was good and it certainly was. I can’t believe that was included as you would usually pay a lot extra for the amazing food and service we received there. The sunken lounge and honesty bar is a lovely area where we sat and spoke to other hotel guests. This is the first I have heard of an honesty bar ever but it’s a great idea. Overall a fabulous stay and would highly recommend this hotel to anyone visiting Dublin! ,5,2022,10,15
216,Great stay,"Lovely Boutique hotel. Rooms are faboulus,loved the 20's jazz club vibe. Breakfast was excelklnt  and a good location away from city center but close to st  stephen's green
Friendly staff.would recomnend trying the Sussey street resturant nearby
Highly recomnended",4,2022,10,08
216,"Not like your usual hotel, in all the best ways","Number 31 was truly unique; a hybrid of a mid-century modernist home and a Georgian townhouse, connected by an outdoor seating area. The staff was very (if I could italicize ""very"" I would) accommodating. The public areas (lounge and fireplace, outdoor area etc) are really special. A few observations: our room was up four flights of stairs (no lift), although the staff lugged our bags up there while we were happily plied with prosecco. So if you have any mobility issues, you might want to confirm exactly where your room is located; not all of them are quite that far up. The room has the usual tea prep equipment, but no coffee maker. And the outdoor seating is lovely, but remember, this is Dublin. So if the weather isn't lovely, you'll just be looking at it as your scurry past in the rain. They do provide umbrellas for guests crossing from the townhouse to the modernist side. 

And that's where breakfast is served (modernist side) which was a highlight of our stay. Lots of options and great service. Delia's ""famous breakfast"" more than lived up to its billing.

The location in south Dublin was handy for lots of sightseeing. And despite the altitude of our room, I'd happily book again.",5,2022,10,07
216,The best B&B in Ireland!,"We spent 3 weeks going around Ireland and number 31 was the best. Location, decor, staff. And Delia’s breakfasts.   A real jewel in A great part of Dublin. Walk over the canal and discover local restaurants a laundry and everything you need within 10 minutes walk.   Enjoy the walled garden and sunken lounge too.",5,2022,09,30
216,Fantastic hotel in Dublin,"A beautiful hotel with gorgeous furnishings and decor. The king bed was so comfortable and our room very spacious with a view to the courtyard. 
The staff were all so helpful and polite. A special mention to Delia and her kitchen! She makes the most amazing breakfasts and each morning we had fresh fruits, breads, and full cooked breakfasts - thanks Delia.",5,2022,09,30
216,Hidden jem,"Quite surprised to find this hidden gem at last minute. Super friendly staff from front of house, house keeping, to catering breakfast staff. 
Room decor fab and spacious, comfy and warm. 
Would not hesitate to stay here again. 10/10",5,2022,09,28
216,Beautiful secret in the heart of Dublin!,"My group of 7 friends stayed here for 3 days at the start of our visit to Ireland. It was lovely in every way! The rooms were super comfortable and I can’t say enough about Delia’s wonderful breakfasts! From omelette to Benedicts to custom orders, Delia can whip up a delicious breakfast that will last you all day. This is not some basic continental breakfast but a full Irish breakfast with wonderful coffee, tea, and juices.

Agatha and her team were wonderful as concierges and guided us to great pubs, called taxis for us, and generally helped us make the most of our Dublin stay. Highly recommend.",5,2022,09,28
216,Fabulous stay,From the moment we arrived until the moment we left the staff were attentive. Our room (22) was amazing. The breakfasts were just wonderful & the chef was really friendly & helpful. The whole atmosphere was relaxed yet professional. Will definitely return.,5,2022,09,28
216,Everyone loves Delia!,"I would have given this hotel the full five stars as it is just the sort of place I like to stay, but, there were one or two issues....
We stayed in room 11, comfy bed and a sweet little private patio.  However there was very little hanging or drawer space for our clothes and no lighting suitable for putting on make up.  Also nowhere to plug in the hairdryer near a mirror.  We overcame the inconviences but the design could have been so much better.
 There also seems to be no sound proofing between the rooms and I was confronted by a very irate American guest next door at 11pm who said she couldn't sleep for the sound of our TV news program.  She returned, even more irate, after I turned the sound down to a whisper and demanded that we turn it off.  (She also demanded the same from the room opposite)  The concierge on duty was apologetic and polite but I did feel uncomfortable using the room from then on.  
After the negative comes the positive...We were made to feel very welcome by the staff, loved the sunken lounge, garden and honesty bar and  I'd die for those beautiful brass and leather rocking chairs!
Then, best of all, DELIA!  What a star both in and out of the kitchen.  As almost everyone else has written, the breakfasts are absolutely delicious and the communal seating makes for a friendly start to the day.  (We avoided the sleepless, irate American lady!)
As well as cooking everything to perfection, Delia made some Barm Brack especially for us on the last morning, as my Irish friend had said how much she missed it.  As we left Delia presented us with a package each of her Brack so we could enjoy breakfast for the next couple of days at home.  THANK YOU DELIA xxx
If in Dublin again I would definitely stay at No 31, but maybe in the town house on either the first or second floor.",4,2022,09,27
216,Doesn't get better than Delia!,This is a charming hotel in a convenient location. Rooms are beautifully designed and spacious. The bed was the most comfortable we had in 10 days in Ireland. One minor issue was the noise from the adjacent property. Thankfully the thick curtains and a sound machine app on our computer saved the evening. The one amenity this hotel did not have on hand was a sound machine for a rare loud party next door. The star of this hotel is Delia. This woman truly cooks with love. It was BY FAR the best Full Irish Breakfast that we had in our 10 day tour.,4,2022,09,25
216,Couldn’t be happier with this delightful place!,"HANDS DOWN BEST BREAKFAST in Ireland!! Chef Delia‘s special touches and homemade breads are something you don’t want to miss! All subsequent breakfasts pale in comparison. I highly recommend the spinach Portabella mushroom eggs Benedict!

The staff here goes out of their way to make guests  feel at home. The main gathering area is inviting and cozy, with the sunken-floor sitting couches and fireplace, not to mention the well-stocked honor bar. The daytime reception staff were so helpful in every way, and the little touches like the wonderful complimentary espresso machine and the delicious cookies were like icing on the cake!

Our room was a wee bit small, but very adequate and had a lovely private sitting patio attached. Easy walk to Saint Stephen’s Green to catch any bus into town. Also easy to walk into downtown for those that are more energetic.

We’ll be back!!",5,2022,09,25
216,"We had 2 nights in Dublin, it was our first time. Great city!","We had room # 33, absolutely fantastic! Lovely view into the garden.
Very nice welcome lady at the reception desk!
Great breakfast, nicely served.
All in all, a great experience, absolutely to be recommended!",5,2022,09,19
216,Delightful respite in busy Dublin,We loved our time at this hotel because the receptionists were also so helpful and friendly. We loved the Nespresso and cookies available 24/7 and the healthy breakfasts offered every day. It was a good location with easy walking distance to where we wanted to go including a bus to the airport on the same street.,5,2022,09,17
216,Extremely overpriced,"I stayed here recently and was incredibly disappointed. Prices are in line with top Dublin hotels but the quality was nowhere close. We were staying on I think the fourth floor in the attic room. There is no lift. The room was tiny and stuffy with barely enough room to fit the bed.

We unfortunately found the staff to be rude, dismissive and unhelpful.

There is much better value to be had elsewhere in Dublin.",1,2022,09,13
216,The best hidden treasure I've ever been to,"This hotel is amazing, especially for architecture and interior design lovers. Very smart hotel, chick, beautiful, and unique. The staff is super friendly. The atmosphere is cool, 20's style! Design with thought on every detail. Super comfortable. Got upgrade to a bigger room for free without asking. THE BREAKFAST - was the best breakfast I've ever eaten in Ireland. DON'T MISS. I recommend it with all my heart. Stay in this hotel, you won't regret it.",5,2022,09,11
216,Beautiful bespoke accomodation  with fantastic breakfast,"We were offered a n upgrade to beautiful room on the 4th floor ,quiet ,very comfortable with complimentary  pillow mist and  great quality toiletries .
Breakfast was cooked to order and perfection on a plate !! 
All the staff were very pleasant and helpful, will definitely be back again .",5,2022,09,09
216,The hotel is spectacular! Don't you dare skip breakfast!,"This hotel is magnificent. Sam's room is beautiful and cozy. I would recommend this room if you're looking to book. 

Make sure you don't skip breakfast. The food is amazing and Delia is like your Irish mum. She's always making recommendations on things to do and see. She cares about the people that walk through her doors. 

I would make the trip back to Dublin just to stay here again. 

Highly recommend adding it to your list.",5,2022,09,06
216,Lovely for a short visit,"Generally speaking we were quite happy with the location and beautiful common spaces of this boutique hotel. The staff could not have been nicer, especially allowing us to arrive at 6am and rest our jet lagged souls on the sunken built in sofa in the mid century modern lobby until the delicious breakfast was opened at 7:30. Our room, 42, was quite pretty but quite small and a hefty walk up 4 flights each time. And the shower was absurdly small. I’d hesitate to stay longer than our 2 nights but would absolutely recommend for a short visit. Perhaps seek a larger room than our plush double. That said, thank you to the very friendly staff!",4,2022,09,05
216,Beautiful building and friendly staff,The room was great and they have a beautiful courtyard in between the two buildings that is open until around 11.  They gave us a lavender spray for our pillows which we were both tickled by.  The breakfast was fantastic with very friendly staff.  The only faults for us were no parking available and the shower was set up in a way that water got everywhere in the bathroom.  We would definitely recommend this place however.,4,2022,09,03
216,Disappointing - Never Again,"I have seen the excellent reviews below, so perhaps we just had a bad experience but it was very disappointing.
We stayed here in August 2022 as we were attending our sons wedding across the road at Number 25 which was truly fantastic. The wedding was at 2.30pm and we asked for an early check in well in advance. We were asked to phone that morning as a reminder and we did that. On arrival at 1pm we were told it would be 30 minutes, after lots of haggling we eventually got a room at 2.20pm. The lady on reception was rude, dismissive and unhelpful.

The room No 9 (I think) was directly off the dining room and quite frankly was not fit for purpose, it was tiny, no dressing table or any room to even unpack bags.

The following morning, breakfast was excellent and the staff very pleasant. However, our the married couple arrived slightly after the 10am deadline and were refused breakfast. Bear in mind there were 10 of us staying there and some staying 2 nights.

So all in all it was a disappointment to say the least, not to mention there is only parking for 4 cars so be prepared to feed meters for the duration of your stay.

Lots of good hotels with better facilities within walking distance.",1,2022,09,02
216,Wow!,"We stayed for just 2 nights, but the service we received was amazing. First and foremost a big THANK YOU to Delia for the delicious breakfasts. She was so warm and friendly, we felt like we had known her for years! If we had to pick just one reason to visit again, it would be Delia 🙂.

That said - and I'm sorry for not asking his name, we were also given a tour of some of the rooms and history of how number 31 came into being. So fascinating and what a lovely touch. It was very apparent how passionate the staff are about the hotel. We came away and enthused about our stay to all our friends. First excuse and we'll definitely be back.

Thank you to everyone!",5,2022,08,30
216,Stunning!!,"Wow what can I say! I had the most amazing stay! The staff and the management could not have been any nicer and more welcoming, breakfast was delicious, so much attention to detail throughout the hotel. The rooms there so clean and well presented. Have recommend to all my friends and family and anyone coming too Dublin. Thank you too all the staff for my amazing stay.",5,2022,08,22
216,Quirky gem,"We stayed for 4 nights and there were lots of lovely things about our visit. Service was top notch, breakfast was absolutely wonderful as well. Location is superb as you can walk to most nearly everything. 
The downsides of our room was the bathroom was way too small. The shower cabin was near impossible to get in and out of and it was far too tiny for an average size adult. It’s also a shame you can’t open the window all the way. We were visiting during rather warm weather and found the room extremely warm and stuffy even with the small dyson fan we had in the room. 
We’ll be back in Dublin in September but won’t be staying here again.",3,2022,08,21
216,Phenomenal!!,"If I could give more stars I would. Phenomenal attention to design detail, delicious breakfast, 5-star service, my trip to Dublin was made spectacular because of this hotel. The garden courtyard, in particular proved to be the best way to unwind after if day of walking tours.",5,2022,08,13
216,Super little hotel in great location,We had a one night stay here.  It was a lovely room.  Service great and breakfast superb.  Loved the little garden and the general quirkiness.  The honesty bar was a great touch.  The location of the hotel good too.  Not far from airport bus stop and close to bars and restaurants.,5,2022,08,11
216,Amazing Stay,"Such a surprise - never knew it existed - staff were excellent, so professional and also so warm and engaging - they listened carefully to our requests in advance of our stay and followed through with them all. Breakfast was a wonderful experience also. One thing was the shower in our room was very tight, I am sure it was just our room. Enjoy your stay there, I will be there again.",5,2022,08,09
216,"Hidden gem in Dublin, great find & super chuffed with our choice!","We stayed at hotel 31 for 2 nights. Absolutely loved the place, from the quirky interior, history of the building, beautiful decorated and luxurious bedroom to the quaint courtyard. 5 star experience! 
Ray and his team were so helpful and friendly!
Delia’s breakfast was delicious and well executed! Fresh fruits, freshly squeezed orange juice, eggs Benedict, Florentine and full Irish, I could go on.
I’m n a nutshell I’d highly recommend this place, I’m super fussy and this ticked all the boxes!",5,2022,08,09
216,Very elegant and excellent hotel in a perfect location.,"Very elegant hotel. Beautiful and with very nice style, much more elegant than most hotels. Fantastic breakfast and good service, also nice staff and comfy rooms. Clean and good rooms, good selection of toiletry accessories like balsam.",5,2022,08,08
216,Annette,"Our stay at no31 was such an amazing one, this hidden gem in middle of Dublin, the rooms are so different to other hotels, pure luxury, the colours, furniture, facilities. The staff are most welcoming and helpful. The breakfast is top class, we have booked to return in September, treat yourself to abit of luxury",5,2022,08,08
216,Great choice!,"Number 31 is in an ideal location for walking in Dublin, close to St. Stephen’s Green, Grafton Street, and good pubs and restaurants. Staff is very helpful both before and after arrival. Delia’s breakfasts are exceptional!! (So is Delia. . . So friendly and welcoming.) Would be nice to have mirrors near outlets for hair-drying. Clean, comfy and very quiet. Will definitely go back!",5,2022,08,07
216,Lovely spot with character,"Thoroughly enjoyed our stay at Number 31. We were here for five nights in August 2022, and stayed in room 32. 

Some highlights: 1) The breakfast was lovely (as everyone has said!), and the hotel was very kind with accommodating if we had to take something to go or eat at a different time. 2) They also have an ideal courtyard, it made for a really nice place to have an end of day drink and get to have fresh air. 3) We stayed in the Georgian house side of the hotel, and the room has beautiful high ceilings and nice light. 4) Lastly, the location was easy — St Stephen’s Green is a 7 minute walk and it’s very flat around there. 

A few things that are worth noting that would get them the fifth star from me: 1) The bathroom in room 32 was odd — the rain head shower sprayed all over the floor every time we used it. It led to us using a lot of towels to keep ourselves from falling on the very slick floor. Our sink also dripped steadily. 2) Housekeeping missed a day, even with the sign to make up the room. Not the end of the world, just with the water issue in the shower, the towel refresh would have been nice. 3) While the front desk was generally helpful (especially with calling cabs), we asked a handful of questions they were stumped by, like how to take the bus. The man who spoke to us wasn’t even sure how to ride the bus, or where the nearest stop was. 

If you choose to book and have any mobility issues, definitely let the staff know. They were always willing to come get our bags from the top floor, and just be aware it’s a climb of about 50 steps to get up there. 

Overall would absolutely stay again, the hotel is cute and has character!",4,2022,08,06
216,Hotel with Lovely Courtyard,Number 31 Hotel is centrally located in the city. I loved my private courtyard and the larger communal courtyard was delightful. I would end each day outside. The staff was wonderful and the breakfast incredible. I will suggest this hotel to my friends.,5,2022,08,02
216,hidden gem,"Unfortunately we just stay there for few nights and it wasn't enough.The staff is extremely courteous and goes out of the way to help you and accommodate any requests .We were warmly welcome by a gentleman who is the General Manager < Myhi >, then he offered us a glass of chilled Prosecco  making us to feel so spoiled .He walked us through the history of the place and we loved his idea of creating the vibe of ''home away from home''.His great customer service made us feel that we knew each other for ages and we could chat for hours .We had the smoothest check in with Agata which showed us to our Fabulous room and it's not just a description it was a fabulous throw back in the Art Deco era .Next day we had the pleasure to meet Delia and her breakfast was just amazing .We have been traveling for the last decade around the world and we finally found the place that ticked all the boxes .We cannot wait to be back and next time maybe we get the chance to experience Sam's room .",5,2022,07,27
216,Wonderful stay in Dublin,"We had a wonderful stay at Number 31 in Dublin. The rooms were clean and comfortable with a retro Jazz age vibe. The receptionists Claire and Agnes were extremely helpful and accommodating. The hotel is located just a few blocks from St Stephen’s Green and an easy walk from all the sights of the City. It was safe, comfortable and convenient. We slept with the windows open and a cool breeze, even in July. The breakfast in the upstairs kitchen was delicious and the chef Dahlia could not have been more accommodating or helpful. She always made great suggestions about where to go and what to see. The staff was extremely helpful and we highly recommend your trip include Number 31.",5,2022,07,24
216,A haven in the centre of Dublin,Stunning boutique  hotel in the heart of Dublin.  Rooms are beautifully decorated.  Lovely terrace for sitting outside to enjoy something from  the honestly bar.  Beds are very comfortable and the breakfast is one of the best I’ve ever had.,5,2022,07,17
216,Exquisite Boutique Bed and Breakfast,"We stayed for one night in Number 31 while attending a show in Dublin. It was a wonderful experience. From the time reception buzzes you in to a small courtyard to the delicious breakfast next morning you feel transported to a little oasis of calm and tranquility. Location is ideal for those who want easy access to Dublin’s shops, bars restaurants…etc. We walked to Grafton street through the beautiful St Stephen’s green (10mins). Additionally there is public transport and/or taxis. Our room was an intimate double, tastefully decorated in Gatsby era. One drawback being an intimate room it was small, therefore the large wing back armchair was superfluous - making it difficult to access the wardrobe. The bathroom was dark as per the decor. The shower-head was a fixed rain type shower-head, not ideal when you do not want to wash your hair and putting shower cap on wrecks the style! On arrival I requested an  iron and ironing board; this was delivered to me in minutes! There was a very well stocked bar in the foyer, it was self service, based on honesty. You served yourself and then documented your drinks. What a lovely idea! Breakfast was served upstairs. There were three areas, inside, a sunroom and outside. Wonderful staff here too and the food was really excellent. The small little niggles of the excess furniture and the shower - head did not overshadow the charm, tranquility and the service which Number 31 offered. Definitely will return. 
P.S. was not aware of any wheelchair access/the layout of Number 31 would create difficulties for those with mobility issues.",4,2022,07,10
216,Great Stay,"Thank you for a lovely stay. Room was absolutely perfect. Couple of small  things, as you probably have heard a million times is all the flights of stairs, which we were no way aware of, the entrance is very hidden and no way stands out, wasn't sure if we were in right place or not for a while, i hate to say it but Brian shouldn't be front of house on reception, he doesn't have a welcoming manner, nor thus he know how to speak on a phone in a manner appropriate to his position. 

Other than that breakfast was amazing, best i think i ever had, so well done to the team both serving and in the kitchen on that. 

Location should be noted as well as great, within walking distance to so many amenities. 

Definitely would go back again

Thanks again
Rose D",4,2022,07,04
216,Great vibe for our last night in Dublin,"We stayed at Number 31 on our last night in Dublin before returning home.

We picked the hotel because it had a fun vibe and we wanted something a little special before our long flight home.  It did not disappoint.  We were greeted with champagne in the sunken sitting area while we checked in.  The rooms were stylish and comfortable.

The location is very nice.  Our taxi driver pointed out several well known pubs out as we drove to the hotel.  It is a relatively quiet street, but still walking distance to the main commercial district and very close to St. Stephen's Green and Iveagh Garden.  We walked from the hotel to Teeling Distillery, then got dinner around Grafton Street, and walked back to the hotel.  It was a fairly short taxi ride on Sunday morning to the airport.

The breakfast in the morning was fantastic.  The service was efficient.  We ate in the wonderful open air area at a farm house style table.  The food was delicious and very filling.  Just what we needed before flying home.",5,2022,07,04
216,Number 31,"The hotel is cute but there is no elevator and we were on the 3rd floor. I booked a deluxe double and my room, while comfy  was quite small. The breakfast was great and the kitchen staff were nice but there was an unfriendly front desk man who seemed annoyed to see us and show us to our room. Not the most pleasant way to be greeted at a hotel. My room was not made up even though I left a please make up on my door.",3,2022,06,26
216,Good choice for Dublin,"Number 31 is a boutique hotel/guesthouse comprising two buildings and a connecting garden.  The building with reception was formerly lived in by the architect who designed  it.  The modern design might not suit everyone's taste, but we liked it.  The other building is Georgian and we did not go into it.  First the good things.  The hotel is just off a fairly busy street, but is perfectly quiet and we slept well.  The room was comfortable but quirky, at ground level on the back with a small private terrace.  The service was excellent, friendly and helpful.  Breakfasts were superb as so many have commented.  There are outdoor sitting areas on a deck and in the garden.  There is also a lovely sitting area near reception with a fireplace and comfy seating. 

   We felt that the fixtures in the bathroom needed upgrading.  The toilet was underpowered and the water pressure in the shower was low. Also I prefer a shower where you can wash without getting your hair wet.  One sink tap was leaking, although it was not a bother.  All this was minor, but it should be dealt with.

Notwithstanding, we very much enjoyed our stay and would recommend the hotel.

  Some advice about getting around.  Although the hotel is very well located, many would wish to use transit.  We bought a LEAP pass for unlimited travel and were very glad that we had.   Several buses stop just outside and they all go to the city centre.  Write down the numbers of the buses to facilitate getting back.  There is also a nearby tram stop, just along the canal.",4,2022,06,07
216,Opulent Dublin Hotel with showstopper breakfast,"We have visited Dublin many times and this boutique hotel was one hidden gem in the upmarket south side of the town.  

When you walk in you are immediately immersed in an opulent mix of Great Gatsby style decor and modern furnishings which continues throughout the property.  

The hosts/ reception staff are more than amenable and we were given a room which was compact but perfectly furnished.  One thing to note is that if you have difficulty climbing stairs ask to be placed on a lower floor.  We had a top floor room which was a challenge to climb but such is the nature of town houses!

The breakfast is superb- in fact the best breakfast we have had in any hotel - ever. All home made - down to the Granola and bread with an exceptional Full Irish Breakfast.

We will return and if you want a slice of Dublin with a very Art Deco feel this hotel will not disappoint.",4,2022,05,28
216,Charming and comfortable,"What a delightful surprise this lovely Georgian townhouse is. We had a one day layover in Dublin and wanted something close to city center and comfortable. Number31 fit  the bill. The architecture is gorgeous, the decor is charming, and the beds are so cozy. The courtyard and the lobby offer lovely areas to sit for a cocktail, rest, or to read.  A stay includes breakfast - don’t miss it! The coffee is served in a French press - a good strong brew. you can order off the menu anything from eggs Benedict to a full Irish. All served with wonderful brown bread and good Irish butter. Tables are community style, so we got to meet our fellow house guests and share travel notes. 

The staff were warm, welcoming and eager to help make our stay a success. 

Our room was a dream. The bed & pillows were so comfortable. The bathroom is modern and well-equipped. The shower was perfect. 

One thing to consider - some rooms include a steep climb up stairs. If you have any issue with stairs, just ask for a room in a lower level. 

There are plenty of good restaurants nearby. We had dinner at Matt the Thresher just down the street. The staff offer great recommendations.  We walked to Grafton St easily in less than 10 minutes.

This is our go-to for future trips to Dublin.",5,2022,05,25
216,Gorgeous hotel,"We only stayed for one night at the Number 31, but we thought the hotel was absolutely gorgeous.  We loved the old Georgian mansion converted into a hotel.  We had a ""fabulous double bedroom"" and it was absolutely beautiful with very high ceilings, old fireplace, and large windows.  We had a window looking out onto the lovely courtyard.  The rooms were very comfortable and beautifully appointed with period touches.  The bathroom is a little small with little sink space to set toiletries, but it was of minor concern to us for one night.  There is free WiFi, of course.  There was a Nespresso machine and an electric kettle for instant coffees and tea.  

The hotel is on the south side of the city and not in the hustle and bustle of the Temple Bar area.  It was a nice quiet location for our first night in Dublin.  There are plenty of bars and restaurants within walking distance.  And, as mentioned, they have a lovely little courtyard with a fountain and some tables which is probably pretty rare in the heart of Dublin.  

The staff was so nice and accommodating.  Check-in was easy and fast, and they give a complimentary glass of prosecco upon check-in.  They also have an ""honesty bar"" where you can pour your own mixed drinks or take a bottle of wine and just write down your name/room number to be charged later.  We also got Delia's breakfast with our stay and it was well worth the price.  An excellent breakfast with a number of options.",5,2022,05,24
216,One night stay,"My Husband & I stayed at Number 31 last Friday. We really enjoyed our stay. The hotel is in a Georgian House, it is run by a very lovely friendly staff. Such a great set up, & just a stones throw from Stephens Green. The Breakfast was amazing with plenty of choice.  We highly recommend it to anyone looking for a welcoming hotel. We will definitely be looking to stay there again the next time we have to be in Dublin. Our thanks to all the staff for making our stay so pleasant. 👍",5,2022,05,23
216,Gorgeous boutique hotel with gourmet breakfast,"Number 31 is a lovely, well decorated boutique hotel in a quiet Dublin neighborhood. The rooms are huge and well-appointed with some nice details. The common spaces are comfortable and clean and the breakfast is a work of art! The hotel is a bit of a walk (~15-20 min) from the major Dublin sites but in a nice, quiet part of town.",5,2022,05,20
216,Great city-centre stay,"We had a very enjoyable time at Number 31 and wouldn't hestitate to return. Highlights included, the location, the garden, the sunken bar area, breakfast menu and very attentive staff. Our only reservation was the capacity of the breakfast room which, when the townhouse was full, became too crowded and a bit stuffy. Communal tables are fine up to a point. The other, minor, comment is that it could have been clearer that guests need to opt-in to have their rooms made-up.",5,2022,05,17
216,The Perfect Stop,"This is a wonderful place to stay. The breakfast is simply delicious, the staff are so friendly, the tea plentiful and the honor system at the bar lends for the perfect excuse to relax and chat by the fire.. The perfect home away from home",5,2022,05,15
216,Hidden Gem,"Stayed here for one night with friends, fabulous place with interesting decor. The location is 5 mins walk from Stephen’s Green so easy to get to and got free parking right outside. The breakfast was delicious and Delia went out of her way to serve it quickly as I were under pressure to get on the road. Great staff, well done to the team at No.31 for providing 1st class service.",5,2022,05,15
216,Hidden Gem,This gem of a boutique hotel did not disappoint.  The staff was so attentive and the manager went out of his way to make us feel welcomed.  The breakfast In the morning was all homemade and delicious. It was a short walk to the center of town and close to many of the attractions.  I would stay here again and would highly recommend it,5,2022,05,14
216,Meh. Disappointing.,"While the room is nice, the bed and pillows comfy, the visit and service was subpar. We were really never folks what the amenities were…we were there 2 days/nights and our room wasn’t serviced and we’re told it was because we didn’t ask for it…but no other place we stayed in Ireland had such a requirement and we were not folks to ask. It was the least friendly staff we encountered in our 1 week and 3 hotels in Ireland. I’ll also add the breakfast was disappointing too.",3,2022,05,03
216,Amazing experience in Art Deco hotel,"The ambiance of this hotel was incredible. Was wowed from the first glance. Adored the 70's style couch pit in the foyer, the courtyard garden was so beautiful and even the corridors leading to our room were beautifully decorated. The breakfast was the highlight - fresh juice, fruit salad and yoghurt, bread and cake and then a menu with excellent selection. I had eggs benedict with spinach and mushrooms, my partner had eggs benedict. Best coffee I've had in a hotel. Staff were accommodating of the fact I was working that day and didn't mind me taking calls in the foyer after I'd checked out. Only negative - Double bed was just two single beds pushed together.",5,2022,04,26
216,Art Deco haven,"We are just back from 3 nights in this beautiful small hotel and it was superb. Well located, a short walk from St Stephen's Green and the airport Aircoach stops close by. For a longer stay, you could also make use of the bus routes to the seaside towns south of the city. We loved the beautiful decor of our Art Deco room, 21. Huge space and excellent amenities. 
We had a late night cap from the Honesty Bar and admired the sunken seating that was a feature of the originally converted mews house. My brother told me that Sam Stephenson, the architect who owned and designed this was a controversial character in Dublin history. Worth a read.
 Breakfast was sumptuous and all staff were friendly and efficient. An excellent place for a stylish city break.",5,2022,04,19
216,Romantic & Inviting,"Not only is Number 31 in the perfect location in the city center, but the rooms were also clean and comfortable. They were also able to accommodate our vegan diet with a delicious breakfast. Highly recommend staying at Number 31 for your next trip to Dublin. It’s the perfect, romantic place for couples. We look forward to visiting again!",5,2022,04,18
216,Beautiful place!,"I stayed here for one night with my boyfriend, and we had a lovely time. It's decorated very nicely and in a good central location. The staff were very friendly and welcoming, our room was lovely and had everything we needed. We really enjoyed the included breakfast- it was delicious!",5,2022,04,11
216,Awesome,"My second stay at #31 this time with my family - couldn't ask for more , okay maybe a sauna ! But honestly, staff are amazing , breakfast is superb and we had a split stay withour second part in the family room which is quite special !",5,2022,04,08
216,Incredible,"This is the coolest hotel I've ever stayed in. 
My wife and I booked a room based on a recommendation by a work colleague and we weren't disappointed. 
This is a hotel of two halves, one side is the beautiful Georgian building with amazing rooms with gorgeous high ceilings with incredible detailing and the other, where we stayed, is the fantastic original 60's architects house with a sunken lounge by the fire and even an honesty bar. We stayed in ""Sam's room"" which I believe was the architect who designed the buildings original bedroom and it's bathroom alone was worth the visit. The room had the most comfortable bed I've ever slept on and for the first time ever I was sorry to be getting into my own bed when I got home.
The staff were so friendly and helpful all the way through our short stay and the breakfast was cooked to order in the morning and it was delicious.
This will be our go to spot every time we stay in Dublin from now on. Cant recommend highly enough.

Phil",5,2022,03,30
216,Delicious breakfasts in beautiful surroundings,"A really enjoyable stay in a beautiful Hotel. 
A breakfast sets you up for the day, generous portions and really delicious.
The courtyard was an ideal place to enjoy the complimentary Prosecco where I took the opportunity to paint a little sketch (see enclosed image) 
Thank you. 
PS a trip to Powerscourt Gardens was a bonus recommendation.",5,2022,03,30
216,Simply superb,"Number 31 is a brilliant base to stay and explore Dublin. The hotel is run by a very friendly and efficient team who couldn't have been more helpful. The rooms have been refurbished in a jazz, art deco style and are very comfortable.

Breakfast is taken on communal tables and is more of a feast than a simple meal to start the day. The food is freshly prepared to order and, in my humble opinion, the best I have had anywhere. Don't let 'communal table' put you off - we spent a wonderful hour with six other guests who had also been to see Sam Fender the night before. 

I cannot rate Number 31 highly enough - would love to return some day.",5,2022,03,29
216,Nice place - shame about the noise!,Great location and lovely room. Unfortunately our room seemed to have an exposed water tank and it was constantly refilling throughout the night. It was like sleeping next to a bathtub filling up. Staff were already aware of the problem when I mentioned it at checkout.,3,2022,03,15
216,"Just avoid ""Sam's Room"" and do not bring luggage.","Hard to give this a score. One room was great, the other not so much. We stayed on a Saturday night which is a massive premium. Apparently if you go to Dublin any other day of the week and it is literally half the price. Felt a little ripped off really. 

One of the most annoying things was not being able to leave luggage for a few hours until we got our train in the evening. We had to spend a long time in a taxi touring round the city organising somewhere else to leave them so we could visit some places. If I had known beforehand we could have organised it better or booked somewhere else! Nobody wants to tour Dublin with a suitcase. Crazy. Be warned. 

We had two double rooms. One was a lovely room in the detached house at the back and the other was Sam's Room in the main building.  These were the only two rooms left on the website. We had been before a few years ago and had a lovely stay so swallowed the price and looked forward to it. 

Sam was the architect that built the house several decades ago. For some reason this room is being kept as a museum to him including the bathroom which hosts cracked and filthy mosaics all over it. It is a massive bathroom but a bit like an old Turkish bath. Not at all lovely. There is no window in the room except a skylight, which I would hazard is a modern upgrade. 

Breakfast was nice but not as amazing as it used to be. The homemade bread was gorgeous. Fruit was served which was lovely, but the main course was very salty. 

All in all a disappointment at the same cost as the Savoy in London! Will give it a swerve for a few years to see if it gets upgraded and then go on a Tuesday....",3,2022,03,08
216,a wonderful and welcoming townhouse,"We had a lovely time in this elegant townhouse. Our family room was spacious and lovely, the art is tremendous, especially in the reception area, and Delia and the kitchen staff are the nicest of people.  Delighted to have discovered Number 31 and we will be back.",5,2022,03,03
216,My first visit to Dublin,This hotel hotel was fantastic. The rooms are so well designed and the decor wonderful. The breakfast was the best I have had ! From the choice to the service all first class . The staff are so helpful and friendly. A really great place to explore Dublin from . Will return .,5,2022,02,25
216,"Number 31...Exquisite, warm and very special","I have stayed in many hotels over the years, but have yet to stay in one that measures up to the unique elegance and comfort of 'Number 31'.

We entered through the unassuming, seclusion of the close, which lead us to the infamous sunken lounge. I was hooked!

The glass walled reception area is proudly positioned looking out over the enclosed courtyard and has the Georgian facade of the main building in its sights.

We stayed in 'The Fabulous Double' . I have to say that this room title was no understatement, as indeed it was a  'Truly Fabulous' room.
Everywhere we looked oozed 1920s glamour and style. From beautiful artwork, to elegant furnishings that seems to have been carefully selected and positioned by a keen eye for detail. 
Each and every staff member that we met throughout our stay was friendly, welcoming and extremely helpful.

Now, I have to mention 'Delia's breakfast' . It was simply delicious! Great ingredients, well executed by an accomplished cook.

I look forward to my return to Number 31....It won't be long before I stay again!

A big ' Thank you' to Ray and the team.",5,2022,02,22
216,Great base to explore Dublin and rest up,"The hotel has a great, relaxed atmosphere where nothing seems too much trouble.

Hopefully returning soon.",5,2022,02,22

216,Great place & great people,We stayed for two nights at Number 31 and had a great experience. The people are friendly and are always willing to help. The breakfast is fantastic. We had a room on the 4th floor of the older building and that was a bit small but hey we only have to sleep there. There was a lot of noise in the morning between 7 and 8 and I think that it is a fan on the roof or something.,4,2022,02,21
216,For sure we will be back,"We really enjoyed our 2 day break which was so restful and enjoyable from start to finish. Great staff especially a young chap that's the manager in there Mihal ,he helped us with the bags to the 4th floor while he told us about the unique style of the Georgian building and the design of each room. Reception staff was amazing , really kind and helpful . We really enjoyed the honesty bar but the cherry on top is Delia's breakfast , I mean you have to try it to be able to talk about ,I really loved the cranberry bread its just amazing. A peaceful stay so close to the city center of Dublin with an excellent room, a comfortable bed and quality facilities. We will be definitely back for summer.",5,2022,02,16

216,Charming and comfortable Dublin stay,"My husband and I were so fortunate to book a great room in the Number 31 hotel —cozy, great bed and bathroom, truly delicious breakfasts every morning. Every room is unique, ours even had an outdoor patio! Comfortable chairs for reading a book after a long day of hiking around Dublin. All the major sites are within walking distance of the hotel, but it’s in its own cool neighborhood which made you feel less like a tourist and more like a local. We’ll definitely stay there again next time we’re in Dublin.",5,2022,01,31

216,The breakfast is amazing !!,"First time to stay at number 31. From arrival to checkout, everything was excellent, staff were so helpful & friendly and not too suffocating like in some 4 & 5 star hotels. Delia’s breakfast was, undoubtedly, the highlight of this business trip for me. Delia herself made time to chat and make recommendations - I’ll be going home half a stone heavier thanks to her and her brilliant kitchen team. Just too class -  would highly recommend this hotel.

216,Sadly not the best stay,"Booked well in advance for my partners 40th birthday as special occasion. I had called ahead to ask if the one room I really wanted us to stay in was available and then confirmed it was free so we stayed in one of the Fabulous rooms. When we got there everything seemed fine, we asked if we could store our luggage as check in wasn't for a few hours but they said the room was ready so we could check in earlier which was great. The room was lovely and we were excited to make the most of our 3 day stay in Dublin and partners birthday so headed straight out. We got back around 8pm to the room and after an early start with flights just wanted to chill out with food in the room and watch some TV. This is when the problems started. The TV didn't work at all and the room was freezing as the heating wasn't working. We managed to get the bedroom radiator to work a bit but had to close all the doors so it was pointless having the room I had chosen as we couldn't use the foyer as it was so uncomfortably cold. We called reception and someone came up quickly to see if they could fix it but sadly they were not able to fix either and so we were offered to move rooms. Sadly, no other rooms were as good as the one I had specifically requested. 50% in size. But the same price for some reason. I explained this was not their fault and moving room was a nice gesture but it was an inconvenience as we had unpacked and were exhausted and doing this at 9.30pm after a long day wasn't good but no compensation was offered. Nothing was explained to us regarding a plan for the morning to see if we could get back into the room for our final night's stay either, we had left the conversation with the lady that evening that we would wait to hear more from them when they had an update. We had paid for breakfast but after a late and unhappy night we woke up too late to attend so skipped. Still no communication from anyone. We had a tour booked at 10.30am so tried to make the most of the day and enjoy ourselves but it was in the back of our minds and tarnished our experience, not to mention my partners 40th that he'll remember for a long while. We finally got a call at midday from the manager starting with a bad tone saying ""why didn't you come for breakfast, we were waiting for you"". I explained the situation and also reminded her that she had my mobile number on record so could have called at any time. She said we can move back into the room as it is fixed but need to do it now because they need the other room. This was no help to us as we were an hour away from the hotel about to have lunch which we had also booked. So we were left with no choice but to stay in a room we were unhappy in. There was no empathy or understanding from the manager, it felt like she was accusing us of being an inconvenience and whilst she did say sorry, she offered nothing to apologise. I was shocked and upset, as was my partner. At this point I explained our disappointment that no one had made it clear we would need to hang around to check out and back in again but this fell on deaf ears. I asked if we could have some money back for the inconvenience as it was not the stay we had hoped for and she said no. I pushed this and she said she would discuss with the team and get back to me within the hour but no call came. We waited 4 hours and couldn't enjoy our day with the suspense and unsettlement and then I decided to call again and was met with an aggressive tone and begrudging refund of €40 which in Dublin will get you very little and is nothing in relation to the cost of the room. As a result of all this we felt too uncomfortable to sit and have breakfast the next day with staff along with sitting in the evening at the bar as it is right next to reception so we didn't use any facilities and get the use out of the stay. I can honestly say if you are contemplating staying here, it's at your own risk. The manager knows nothing about basic politeness or customer service and should anything go wrong you will not feel supported. I think this was the worst day in a hotel we have ever had and we will be going out of our way to make sure this doesn't happen to anyone else so avoid at all costs. There are so many amazing places to stay in Dublin, this is not the one!",2,2021,12,17
216,Axel in his review was correct,"We had a room on the 4th floor. My partner is pushing 70. Even the young woman who showed us to the room was visibly and audibly out of breath by she time she took us there - luggage and all. 

Bathroom tiny. Shower cubicle - well I am glad we are skinny.

The bedroom looked out on the main street. At 1.10am a car alarm went off. That's when we discovered the windows were not double glazed. The alarm went off at 1.40am. Then it went off again before dawn. Then buses, car horns, you name it. 

They need to warn people about the 4 floors and they need to add secondary glazing to the bedrooms over-looking the street. 

The good news is that it was cheap, we managed to get free parking and the breakfast was good. 

I wouldn't stay there again though. 
",2,2021,12,14
216,Nice experience,"As an option for a visit close to Dublin City Centre, this place ticked a lot of right boxes. A comfy room in the old Georgian House tastefully decorated. The breakfast offering is just perfect. Provides a nice seating area to relax beside the honesty bar. A couple of small issues. 1) the stairs to the 4th floor is a strenuous test if you are less than fully fit and forewarned on same might have be advised. 2nd floor seems a good option. 2) the ensuite shower in our room was designed terribly. Cubicle is tiny and the low large over head shower makes a very uncomfortable experience as you can't side step the flow. It appears this is not an issue in all rooms, so you may have a better experience based on different rooms. That said we would happily return.",4,2021,12,12
216,Fab hotel,"Really nice hotel the pictures online really don't do it justice,from the individual bedroom doors to all the chandeliers the style throughout is faultless.
Staff where extremely nice and helpful. Definitely the nicest breakfast have ever had in a hotel. Will stay again!",5,2021,12,07
216,Dublin regular,"Really worth seeking out this smashing place as an alternative to the big expensive hotels in same area. Good sized rooms with comfy beds, walk in shower in our plush double was super. Polite, efficient, smart staff. Breakfasts cooked and served by Delia and her team were better than in some 5 star hotels nearby! Good location, short walk to St Stephens green. Air coach 700 drops of and picks up near 31, return ticket only 9 euro
Maybe a little attention is due to be given to some fixtures and fittings but same could be said of many establishments.
Number 31 is highly recommended and our new first choice when staying in Dublin.",5,2021,12,06
216,A hidden gem,"This is a lovely place to stay. Close enough to the city centre to walk to the sights (5mins to St Stephen’s Green), but tucked away enough to offer peace and quiet. 
We stayed in a ground floor twin room. It was nicely furnished and the beds were very comfortable. It also had a cute little private patio area where we would have enjoyed sitting had it not been late November. 
Every single member of staff we met was absolutely lovely and made us very welcome. The breakfasts were fantastic, I wish I could eat them every day.
Highly recommend booking Number 31 if you are looking for a city break in Dublin.",5,2021,12,01
216,What a great hotel!!,"We like staying at special hotels, the smaller ones instead of the large ones. We found it at Number 31, what a nice and great place when you are visiting Dublin. The building has amazing rooms (with very comfortable beds), a lovely garden and the breakfast is the best we ever had in Dublin so far; thanks to Delia!! It is only a short walk to the city centre and on the opposite site of the street you can have a really nice evening at Dublin House.",5,2021,11,30
216,Best Breakfast in Dublin City,"We recently stayed at No31 to get away for a night for Dinner & Drinks with another couple. This hotel has it all! The lovely Lucia greeted us at Reception and showed us to our rooms that were so comfortable and chic. Love the added convenience of the Nespresso machine in the room. There were 4 of us so we had two spacious rooms on the second floor with the most stunning decor & bathroom.
After a short chill and using the lovely VOYA products in the room, we enjoyed a bottle of prosecco downstairs in the sunken seating area by the fire before heading out for Dinner nearby. The following morning we enjoyed what I can only say is the tastiest and coolest breakfast in town cooked by chef Delia! The Eggs benedict were delicious and the service and little touches of loaded fresh fruit pots and sliced muffins were just so tasty.
Well done to Ray and all the team at Number31. This hotel is a gem and we will be back for sure. We have no hesitation in recommending it to everyone and giving it a 5 star rating.",5,2021,11,27
216,"BEST Hotel in Dublin , not #7 out of 177 , should be #1 out of 177 !!","I have lived in Dublin since 2000 ( I am originally from top of the country, N.I )  and friends /family often ask me, when they not staying with us that is, ""What hotel should we stay in for a weekend in Dublin ? ""  I always hesitated with a recommendation slightly , as I do not stay in Dublin City hotels too often but now I will not give it a second thought ..... THIS IS THE ONLY HOTEL TO STAY IN DUBLIN .....  It was a classic one of those fortunate finds.  I had friends in from the UK at the weekend and we chose to stay in Number 31.   First to last , we had an amazing stay. .  ALL the staff, were the most courteous and polite guy's I have ever met ,in the Hotel hospitality industry.   I was blown away by the decor , rooms, staff and value.  Not to rave on too much , as the picture is surely set.  Well done to all at #31 , we all loved it and cannot wait for the next 'any other excuse' to stay in town, for a night !  

I simply have to add though, breakfast was probably one the best I have ever, ever had ( Eggs  Benedict like no other I have tasted)  Thank you once again Chef, for accommodating our slightly late ( hungover ) attendance at 10:20am.  10+/10 !!",5,2021,11,22
216,Ire v NW Stay,"We had our first stay in No31 for the Ire v NZ Autumn International. From the moment we were greeted by Lucia in reception to check out with Ray and Ana the next morning, we had a fabulous experience.  Our room was cool, with a seaweed parcel and VOYA products.  There is a ease to this property, a chic, cool ease.  We absolutely loved it and are planning our return trip already.  Our memories of post match bubbles on the garden veranda on an causally warm November evening was our highlight. Fab-U-Lous.",5,2021,11,16
216,Fabulous,A fabulous stay.  It was my Dad's 80 birthday so wanted to treat my parents to a night out in Dublin.  We were so well looked after. My husband and I stayed in the mews and my parents stayed in the Georgian House.  I wanted to experience Sam Stephenson's minimalist style while I wanted the luxury of the opulent Art Deco style for my parents.  Breakfast was delicious.  I recommend this boutique hotel.,5,2021,11,15
216,When you discover a hidden gem!,"I’m not sure I can say enough about Number 31. From the moment we arrived and came through the slightly mysterious front door, it was literally like stepping into our own personal Narnia (a gorgeous boutique bed & breakfast with no snow type of Narnia). 

A warm welcome from everyone, including Ray, who couldn’t have been more helpful & genuinely interested in stopping for a chat with his guests.

The sunken lounge, fire place and honesty bar, which is housed in the modern mews side of Number 31, is a sight to be seen - & I won’t be able to do it justice in this review. 

We were all staying in the Georgian townhouse rooms, which were just a short walk across the most beautifully contemporary garden from reception (in the mews). 

The rooms were really well appointed and beautifully decorated, couldn’t have asked for more.

Breakfast was plentiful & delicious, we had Delia’s famous Full Irish, and there was also freshly squeezed orange juice, fresh fruit & breads brought to the table as well.

Number 31 is truly a hidden gem, an oasis in the city & I can’t wait to go back again! Superb stay from start to finish. 

Thank you to Ray & all the team!",5,2021,11,13
216,The perfect little oasis,"My 2 friends and I spent 24 hours in the luxury, calm and beauty of Number 31, we were left alone to enjoy our break, no fuss, the honesty bar was a lovely touch and the breakfast was amazing. The decor, hand painted wallpaper, art deco furnishings and quirky touches were beautiful. We will be back again, this place beats some of the 5 star hotels we have used for these little catch ups before. Thank you Number 31",5,2021,11,10
216,Quick trip to visit son studying at UCD,"My husband and I spent a wonderful 4 nights at Number 31. I chose it for its charm and small size and for it’s quiet elegance. We were not disappointed. The hotel is a mix of Art Deco and mid-century-modern decor and was unlike anywhere else we have stayed. Our room looked out on the beautiful terraced garden with fountain and fire pit. A little chilly to make good use of, but beautiful to pass through each day. Our bed was incredibly comfortable and a delicious breakfast was served in a bright modern perch over the entryway for the handful of other guests. The spot is perfectly located and just a 10 minute walk through St. Stephen’s Green to the shopping and hubbub of Grafton street. We had asked for a room on a higher level which they accommodated and we got used to the stairs up as there is no elevator.  We look forward to returning to Number 31.",5,2021,11,09
216,Excellent hotel with SUPER breakfast!,"Really excellent hotel - room was lovely, bed was SUPER comfy and bathroom was great. Breakfast was definitely the best part though - great selection, everything was really yummy and helped set us up for a lovely few days in Dublin. Staff were lovely and helpful- reception even helped source some safety pins for me to prevent an awkward wardrobe malfunction! All in all, great stay!",5,2021,11,08
216,Good experience but…,"On arrival we loved the beautiful space, excellent design and interesting art.  We liked the informality of the honesty bar and the sunken seating with the lovely fire but we didn’t like it when the fire was turned off without any consultation while we sat enjoying a drink.  The breakfast was excellent.  Overall a good experience but a little more attention to detail would make it perfect.",5,2021,11,08
216,A wonderful stay,"Fantastic Hotel with great service and wonderful breakfasts. Slept well in a huge comfy bed and the hotel is located  in a quiet area.  The internal garden is  charming and the lounge cosy and beautiful complete with fire and honesty bar .The perfect place as within easy walking distance to all the sights etc. Thank you Delia and staff , it was our first trip since the beginning of Covid and it was a real treat.",5,2021,11,05
216,Terrific high-end home-away-from-home feeling for a combined five-day stay,"Stayed here with my partner for three days, then returned for a further two days after a whirlwind tour to the west of Ireland. No. 31 was the perfect spot to start out at every day and come home to every evening. Warm, comfortable, stylish and unpretentious, it gave us a terrific high-end home-away-from-home feeling. Attentive staff added to an overall fantastic experience.",5,2021,11,05
216,customer is king,"Dublin is a great town, we'll come back for sure - and in this case we'll come back to Number31  just as sure. The staff is really very helpful and always friendly, the bus stops are next to the door, the rooms  are beautiful with individual design and very comfortable beds and the breakfast is delicious, thank you also for the vegan option. See you again.",5,2021,11,03
216,A rare find,"We were impressed with Number 31 as soon as we walked through the door into the courtyard. It is an oasis of calm in a busy city. The hotel is split into 2 parts. We stayed in the modern part. For an inner city hotel, the bedroom was spacious with windows that actually opened! Decor was first class, bathroom perfect. All the staff that we met were professional, polite and very helpful. We were excited for breakfast having read previous reviews and it did not disappoint. The bowl of fruit was so fresh, the breads delicious and there was a wide selection of cooked breakfasts to choose from. 
The location of Number 31 was excellent. A short walk to St Stephen's Green. 
We will definitely be back and look forward to staying in the Georgian rooms next time.",5,2021,10,28
216,Very relaxing,From the start at check in the staff were very friendly and helpful. The reception area is very welcoming and the link garden to the main house is a place you can sit back with a glass of wine relax with a group of friends or reading a good book. The room I stayed in was 31 at the top of the house and as you walk up through the house it's all fabulously decorated. The room was clean and fresh and truly it was a great night sleep as it was quiet and no noise from outside the room. The breakfast room was well services and a great choice of foods for breakfast. The location is good and the fact it's not in the centre of the city is good because no noise which was great but still less than 10 mins walk to St Stephen's Green. I'd highly recommend number 31.,5,2021,10,26
216,Perfect spot,Fantastic staff and accommodations. Breakfast is a must so do enjoy it. Great location in center of city. Very relaxed sunken lounge to have a cocktail. We stayed in room 19 and it was very quiet and comfortable. We would gladly stay there anytime we visit Dublin!,5,2021,10,25
216,What a Gem!,"First time staying in this fabulous hotel. Handy location for city centre shops and local restaurants.
Rooms were nicely decorated and spotlessly clean.
Intimate  room  was plenty big for two persons for a short stay.
Ground floor rooms can be noisy if other guests late returning or gathered in the lounge area, so might be best to ask for a higher room.
Delicious breakfast with such an amazing choice served by very attentive staff.
Many Thanks.",5,2021,10,23
216,Pleasant surprise ,"My friend booked our stay here so I really didn’t know what to expect but what a pleasant surprise. It reminded me of the secret garden...we were greeted by friendly staff & checked in quickly. Our luggage was taken to our lovely room with trendy decor. I never sleep well when away but I found the bed and pillows extremely comfortable. The location was also perfect. Overall, I had a lovely experience and found the staff really polite, helpful and friendly. I will definitely stay here again.",5,2021,10,20
216,Fabulous!,"Hidden gem in a great location.
Staff professional, helpful and friendly.
Hotel and rooms spotlessly clean.
Beds and pillows really comfortable.
Breakfast was amazing.
I will definitely return.
I highly recommend!",5,2021,10,17
216,Fabulous & Fantastic,"Fantastic hotel, with a cool & funky vibe. Decor & layout is cool with the added bonus of an “honesty” bar. Breakfast was delicious, Ray & staff went above & beyond.. The location is excellent. We will definitely be back ! !",5,2021,10,17
216,Wonderful hidden jewel!,"Beautiful building, refined, clean and well positioned. Breakfast is excellent and the staff is extremely professional and friendly (we were attended by the charming Lucia!). Overall very pleasant stay. Highly recommended.",5,2021,10,16
216,Lovely hotel - everything about my stay was perfect!,"I've been coming to Dublin regularly on business for 5 years, and have stayed in many hotels. This was my first stay at Number 31 and I'm thrilled to have found it - My new favourite!  It is just a lovely place, decorated well, super comfortable and large room, very relaxing and cozy common areas. And the staff was nothing short of spectacular. It really made my ordinary work trip a spectacular experience in Dublin.  I highly recommend and look forward to my next stay!",5,2021,10,13
216,Great stay!,"Cute hotel in a great location (close enough to the busy areas but far enough to get away from it, too). Delicious breakfast and friendly staff. Our room was nice but was difficult to keep cool. There was a fan provided, which helped, along with keeping the window open. However, we were on the ground level so we didn’t feel like we could keep the window open while we were out. Overall, would recommend this place to stay as a good center point for exploring Dublin.",4,2021,10,13
216,"No 31, a hidden gem","Hidden down a narrow road way off Leeson Street you will find No.31. As soon as you step through the door into the Mews part of this hotel you will be impressed. You will first encounter the “sunken” sitting area which also has an honesty bar. This area leads out into the garden which has seating and a fire pit. Beyond the garden is the Townhouse where most rooms are. Rooms are decorated in an Art Deco style. The whole establishment is kept immaculate and the staff are very warm and helpful. Breakfast is exactly as other reviews have described, fabulous. There is limited parking (4 cars) on first come first served basis. We availed of the current offer with a meal in Dax which was exceptional. Overall a great find in Dublin .",5,2021,10,10
216,Great small elegant hotel with outstanding breakfast ,"An amazing hidden gem. Interesting building with modern and classic  features. We had the Cotton Club room which was fitted out with 1920's glamour features. Generous ante room and a lovely bedroom and en suite bathroom. Staff were very friendly helpful and attentive. Breakfast was memorable. Freshly cooked with a lovely choice of unusual items. Fresh fruit salad, home made cranberry and walnut bread . Several choices of cooked items to please anyone. 
 .Served in a lovely dining area by very professional staff. A beautiful terrace between the old part and the new with a fire and water feature. Delightful.  Highly recommend this first class hotel. ",5,2021,10,08
216,A hidden gem with real character and charm,"My wife and I stayed at No.31 for two nights whilst on holiday in Dublin. The hotel is a little tricky to find, but the secluded entrance is part of it's intriguing character. The reception staff were very friendly and welcoming and the lobby is stylish, with a retro 1960s feel. The hotel has a 1920s/1930s theme throughout which makes it a genuinely distinct experience in an age of chain hotels. We opted for the Fabulous Double room which lived up to its name. Large and spacious, with a big cosy bed, retro furniture and beautiful decor. Delia's breakfast was the highlight. Freshly baked bread, freshly sqeezed juice and a selection of hot dishes served in a lovely airy dining room. No.31 is a stylish hotel, well located, with old fashioned good service. Would definitely stay again!",5,2021,10,06
216,Wonderful Dublin boutique hotel,"Everything about this hotel was positive- the quiet location,the high quality of the accommodation, the excellent and very friendly customer service, and the yummy breakfasts.

We stayed in Room 21 in the Georgian part of the hotel, which has been afforded an art deco/jazz age makeover.

There was a fine restaurant virtually opposite and an agreeable canal-side path in close proximity.

You are well away from hen-party central.

The staff and management of Number 31 are to be highly commended!",5,2021,10,05
216,Unique in Dublin!,"The breakfast is indeed great, the decor is fun and hospitality is fantastic (got a free upgrade). The  location is a mere 15m walk to the heart of Dublin. Only the pillows need upgrading to be supportive. Very good experience!",5,2021,09,29
216,A Gem in Dublin,"We stayed for one night before leaving on a trip around Southern Ireland, and then on a second night at the end of our journey. These two nights at Number 31 compared very favourably to a 5 star hotel we stayed in in Killarney, high praise indeed.
Staff are very friendly and helpful.

We had two different rooms. The first was on the ground floor in the new part and was excellent for amenities, including a private outside area for relaxing in. The second, room 21 , was like a suite with a sitting area. The decor here was outstanding in an art deco style, very tasteful with beautiful touches.

The breakfast is legendary from other reviews, and they are not wrong. These two breakfasts were the best compared with anywhere we stayed on our two week trip in some outstanding hotels.

Parking is limited at the property but staff are most helpful in making it work out.
In the future we will certainly return to Number 31 and will not consider any other property in Dublin.",5,2021,09,24
216,Amazing stay!,"We booked 7 rooms to celebrate a soon to be bride and had the most fabulous stay here. The team working were so lovely and couldn't have been more accommodating. The rooms are spacious and the decor is fab, beds were super comfy and we made full use of the dyson fan and Voya products! We used the conservatory for an organised activity and it was just perfect! 
Would definitely recommend. 10 out of 10!",5,2021,09,24
216,Beautiful stay,"My daughter and I had the best stay here. Everything is top class. The beds are so comfortable along with the soft, fluffy quilt. The voya products are gorgeous as is the bathroom. The breakfast is amazing and the staff are so great too. I couldn’t recommend number 31 enough. We had our own balcony too with a small garden area. The foxford throws and cushions brought luxury to the room. The location is perfect, right in the middle of the city centre. The garden area and the honesty bar are spot on too. It is spotless and the quiet area is pure relaxing. Perfect from beginning to end. Loved it. Can’t wait to come back.",5,2021,09,24
216,Visit to Dublin,"No. 31 can only be described as simply fabulous!  I loved everything about it.  The room was perfect, it had everything one would need but nothing excess, plenty of room to move around.  I loved the ambience of the whole place including the lobby seating area and the garden.  The location is excellent.  It was quiet at night but within very easy walking distance of the city centre.  There  is a convenient bus stop right outside.  The breakfast is justly award winning, probably the best ever!  Staff were very friendly, professional and helpful.",5,2021,09,23
216,Solo female traveller - incredibly comfortable and safe,"I had a wonderful stay at Number 31. They could not have been more accommodating, the famous breakfasts were definitely worth it and the atmosphere was lovely. 

I chose to stay in the area because it appeared safe and close enough to everything. I easily walked into central Dublin for all the tourist spots, restaurants and bars. It's only a short walk from St Stephen's Green and easy to catch the bus from too. 

I had one G&T from the honesty bar which I thought was a brilliant touch. I spent most my time outside the hotel but it was a really comfortable place to relax and the breakfasts kept me full until mid afternoon, Delia definitely did not scrimp on the portions. 

I'd say my only criticism was the shower, I don't tend to wash my hair every day and it was a slight struggle to shower without getting my hair wet  as it was slightly on the small side, but if that's my only issue then it's hardly a reason not stay there! They have everything you need in the room, even a dyson fan! 

As a solo, female traveller I felt incredibly safe. The staff were really friendly and have great knowledge of the area. The bed was so comfortable, as one person it was huge and luxurious. 
I would absolutely stay here again. I will be recommending Number 31 to anyone planning a trip to Dublin.",5,2021,09,21
216,Excellent Place to Stay in Dublin!!,"The room was very modern and clean with all the amenities we needed. The people were all extremely nice and welcoming. Bathroom was clean and modern with nice rainforest shower option or hand held. The breakfasts were one of the better ones we had on our trip to Ireland - all in all a great value, loved Number 31 and will be back!",5,2021,09,20
216,Perfect option for visiting Dublin,"We stayed at two different hotels while visiting Dublin and Number 31 was definitely the winner, in large part because of chef Delia's outstanding breakfast and genuine hospitality. She quickly remembered things like our names and how we take our tea and coffee, and also made great recommendations for our trip. It's obvious that she cares a great deal about guests having a positive experience and she really made us feel at home. The hotel is beautiful and thoughtfully designed with nice rooms and friendly staff who are happy to help with whatever you need. It's also a very convenient location for seeing the city and has plenty of great restaurants and pubs within walking distance. The hotel has 4 parking spaces available for free on a first-come, first-served basis. If the spaces are taken, there is plenty of paid street parking around the hotel that isn't terribly expensive.",5,2021,09,20
216,Next time I'll stay longer,"This Inn has mastered hospitality.  My stay was the final night after several weeks in Ireland, and was only meant to be a quiet sleep before flying out the following morning.  Next time, I'll stay longer. Staff were extremely cordial and helpful; the breakfast was one of the finest of the entire trip; the room was immaculate and cozy; the entire atmosphere and experience was a grand finale for my first visit to Ireland.",5,2021,09,12
216,Fabulous Hotel,"We stayed for one night and I could not fault the Hotel. Lovely quirky decor and garden area. The staff were fantastic very friendly and welcoming. The bedroom was perfect, very spacious. Breakfast was gorgeous.",5,2021,09,12
216,Small but perfectly formed,"We stayed at Number 31 for two nights in Sept 2021 and had a fabulous time.

The hotel is small, but so beautifully decorated that I was in awe. Tasteful and classy, not like most Irish hotels. The staff were friendly and helpful, without being too much. Our room wasn't very big, but had a private garden and perfect sized bathroom. The bed was comfortable. There was even a fan which we were glad of as it was warm one night! 

The breakfast deserves its own paragraph. Fresh fruit, freshly squeezed orange juice, breads, and a really impressive menu of hot foods. It was stunning. The coffee was even good, which is rare.

We also loved that everyone was following public health measures, but the hotel wasn't covered in reminders of the pandemic. People wore masks, but mostly the guests were trusted to know the guidelines and stick to them. No big yellow signs everywhere. We felt safe, but in a subtle way. 

We will absolutely be back to this hotel, we have found a favourite in Dublin!",5,2021,09,12
216,Ten out of ten experience,"My daughter and I stayed in this hotel 
It’s a real gem … soo happy with our find. 
Staff, the room and the breakfast was amazing. 
We would definitely recommend it and will stay there again. 
The rooms are really nicely decorated, the court yard is class.",5,2021,09,10
216,Delia's breakfast was excellent!,Really lovely 2 night stay in August. Breakfast was a highlight for us and Delia was so friendly and also had spot on recommendations for dinner and activities. Very well situated within easy walking distance to the main tourist areas.,5,2021,09,09
216,Amazing spot,"Front desk staff were all exceptionally friendly and helpful, chef Delia’s breakfast is AMAZING especially served in the conservatory. We loved our room, reading by the fire out in the courtyard and very close proximity to St. Stephens Green, shops and restaurants.",5,2021,09,09
216,"Number 31, More like Number 1",From the moment we checked-in we were welcomed so warmly by the staff and had a drink which we had in the garden by the fire pit. The room was absolutely gorgeous and the whole experience was beyond our expectations.,5,2021,09,05
216,Perfection,"Everything about Number 31 is special. The building, the decor, the gorgeous staff, the bed ( the best sleep I’ve had in a bed that’s not my own) the thoughtful carefully prepared breakfast. I have stayed in most of Dublin’s hotels at this stage,  I’m only annoyed with myself that it’s taken me this long to discover Number 31. I have already booked my next stay. Utterly Charmed.",5,2021,09,04
216,This is no ordinary boutique hotel.,"All attendees at our daughter's wedding stayed at number 31.It was a brilliant decision. The hotel  staff ooze hospitality. Nothing was too much trouble. It provided the perfect setting for mingling. Family and friends could relax in the well ventilated sunken"" lounge with its ""honesty"" bar or the sun drenched court yard . The latter was a real magnet by night with its fire pit.The lovely friendly atmosphere set the perfect tone for the wedding.
       Delia's breakfast was simply amazing. The ""fabulous "" bedrooms certainly lived up to the title with plenty of space for hairdresser and make-up artist alike. The vola products were a lovely  additional touch.  A special word of thanks to the manager Ana Maria.",5,2021,09,02
216,A hotel run by people who have seemingly never actually stayed in a hotel,"Please, for your own sanity, do not stay here. 

3 night stay, couple, booked direct. 

Where do I begin? 
Perhaps the quite rude email demanding new credit card details as my card had declined after repeatedly inserting the wrong details (quite happy to admit I probably put it in wrong when booking online, although they did also keep addressing me by my surname). Took a good 10 minutes to persuade the receptionist to readback the details they had on file so I could verify. Lo and behold amazingly it worked. But this put me on the back foot immediately. 

Arrival and check in - 'sign here. These are your keys. This is your room' followed by something mumbled about breakfast timings. No mention of a WiFi password or any other pertinent information (as will become clear). Before we could ask she was gone. 

Sam's Room - the prestige room of the hotel. Ignore their photos. It's not great. We settled on 'Scandi prison chic' as the best description. No windows other than a skylight. I've seen more imaginative use of space in IKEA. There is a completely enclosed sofa and tv area which is just bare and depressing. The whole room feels bare and claustrophobic. The TV did not come with a remote control. There were a generous TWO nespresso capsules to keep us going. Why voluntarily leave more when you can just get the guests to come ask?

Oh and you will have to go to the reception physically because there's no guest manual in the room, or indeed a phone list. I know the reception's not 0 at least. Maybe you can find out by randomly dialling a bunch of numbers and seeing what happens. You'll find the reception hidden behind a pillar. 

The exposed and whitewashed brick has metal conduit piping giving an impression of a regional technical college more than a luxury hotel. Plenty of plugs on display though. Probably useful for doing the hoovering. The bathroom has tiles peeling off. The worktop is cracked and broken. The toilet seat doesn't fit. The sinks leak (heavily) because the taps don't reach over the basin. 

The finish and detailing in the bedroom and bathroom are atrocious. The conduit piping has been drilled through the walls with a hammer.

The ceilings are about 6'3"" so be careful if you're tall. The nights are surprisingly noisy (bearing in mind the Leeson st clubs aren't even open again yet) with the skylight open. Also the room door is directly onto the corridor between hotel entrance and reception. And you share a wall with the hotel bar, which is actually cut out of your room. 

Full marks to the very large and comfortable bed however. 

The breakfast of which such a big deal is made: adequate at best. I don't like to say this as Delia the chef seemed to be very nice and welcoming to guests. The Irish fry was lipid. Came with toast one day, without the next for no apparent reason. Two limp sausages. The eggs benedict were dry. The (traditional) soda bread was not great. Be prepared to repeatedly ask for more milk, butter, tea, coffee...

To top it off the waitress asking for our room number looked completely blank when we said we were staying in Sam's Room. The room named after the hotel's architect and previous owner. The room that is front and centre on the website. ""But what's your room number?..."" Why are you asking us ffs.

Returning to the hotel on our second day we found the room had not been cleaned. ""Excuse me but it seems our room has not been made up"" ""You didn't ask. You have to ask. Because of covid."" ""Perhaps someone should have told us we have to ask"" ""Yeah I guess"" Blank faces. 
No apology! No how can we make this up to you?! 

Next day - ""We're going to be out for two hours. Can someone please do up the room while we're out so that we can come back to relax here this afternoon?"" ""Sure"". Did they do it? Starting to see a pattern. 48 hours into our stay and now we're out of towels and loo roll. It's getting like lockdown all over again. 

We left to give them another two hours to do the room. They kindly left the door unlocked to let us know they had been in. 

Incidentally Room 9's door opens into the breakfast area so hopefully people in that room enjoy early morning conversation through their walls. 

The absolute killer with this hotel is that NO-ONE GIVES A HOOT! We encountered one responsible adult in our three days there. Everyone else seems to be on a gap year or part-time job. The idea of trying to give anyone a special stay is just not considered. Perhaps I'm petty, but when you can see that the staff don't care about the small things, the big things fall apart too. 

Upon leaving (possibly the happiest of my experiences at the hotel) they weren't sure whether they had messed up our bar charges (lower than expected) or if they had been comp'ed. However they also charged the room in separate transactions so I got 2 different currency transaction fees. 

All in all, E500 for a grey, bare room with an unmade bed, a disappointing breakfast, and a massive headache. I never realised staying in a hotel could be such hard work. Do yourself a favour and stay anywhere but here.",1,2021,09,02
216,Wonderful experience,"My sister and I have just enjoyed a great stay at Number 31. Warm welcome from Receptionist Ellie and Gaston. Delicious, freshly cooked breakfast by star chef Delia Bracken who took such great care of us.",5,2021,08,23
216,Amazing,"This is an absolutely beautiful boutique hotel. The rooms are gorgeously designed with personality, balancing both a modern and period theme. They were perfectly clean and flawless. The staff are very friendly and happy to help with any queries. The outdoor area with a firepit is a nice touch and a lovely place to sit and relax on a warm evening, Breakfast was delicious, a special thank you to Delia who made our stay complete. I will definitely stay again if ever in Dublin.",5,2021,08,18
216,A special occasion,"Our small holiday in Ireland has been our wedding trip and it's been a pleasure to spend a day in this particular,  comfortable hotel.  We did appreciate a drink in the garden at night and the delicious breakfast in the morning.  We definitely hope to come back again!!!",5,2021,08,17
216,Super stylish and hospitable boutique hotel,"The Team at Number 31 were so extremely hospitable; Manager Ana Maria corresponded with me about how to look after family who were joining us in Dublin on the day we were leaving -- her efforts ended up with a fantastic family gathering hosted by Delia in the sunny, airy breakfast room. We had a great time on our visit and would recommend Number 31 with real enthusiasm!",5,2021,08,16
216,Mother & daughter break,"We recently had the pleasure of five nights in Number 31, a wonderful hotel in the heart of Dublin. The staff were very friendly, without being intrusive. 
Many things helped make the stay very relaxing: the rooms are luxurious, Voya products are a lovely touch, the little outdoor private seating area off the room was a lovely surprise but the highlight was Delia’s breakfast. The reviews do not do it justice! Fresh fruit & orange juice to start with homemade brown bread and Delia’s cranberry & orange nut loaf (worth the trip alone), followed by cooked option from the menu, it set us up for the day. 
Although there is limited parking, we were able to park the car overnight on Fitzwilliam Place free of charge. 
This is a place we look forward returning to. Thank you all",5,2021,08,15
216,Delia saves the day!,"Visiting from New York, we found our recent stay at #31 in Dublin  a perfect choice. Comfortable room and lovely sunken communal lounge. 

The  breakfast and attention to detail by Delia transformed a pleasant stay into an exceptional one. 

In addition to her exceptional cooking and attentiveness in the dining room, I would like everyone to know about her kindness and willingness to help.

Delta’s 22 years of experience and wonderful Irish personality are well worth a visit.",5,2021,08,13
216,Amazing breakfast! ,"We stayed here for the first couple of nights for our honeymoon and nothing was too much trouble for the staff. We arrived very early and they were able to check us in early (for a fee). They helped us with car parking, a fan for our room, iron, recommendations for places to eat, they called the places to check they were open for us etc. I know most of these are standard things, it’s just the way the staff handled our requests so quickly and in such an efficient way! 

We had a little issue with the air con in our room making a noise and the staff found a solution almost immediately on us mentioning it to them. 

To top off what was already a lovely stay and what stands this stay apart from others in my opinion is the breakfast. We were initially given some home baked banana bread and another loaf with some jams, then a bowl of fresh fruit and yogurt, together with fruit juice and coffee and then chose an option from the hot menu. 

I had the full Irish both days, which is unusual for me two days in a row, but after the first day I couldn’t resist ordering the same on the second. The ingredients and cooking are second to none in my opinion, and the only downside is that we’ve had this at the start of our holiday so it’s unlikely to be topped for the remainder of the holiday. Delia who runs the kitchen and cooks everything is really friendly and so efficient. I would whole heartedly recommend! ",5,2021,08,11
216,Breakfast is a highlight of No 31,"We have returned to No 31 four times because of the central location, the unique rooms and the beautiful courtyard. We love the fabulous breakfasts, made to order by the lovely Delia. The breakfast menu is excellent but it is the little extras and friendly, helpful service that make breakfast such a highlight of a stay in No 31. Delia is the treasure of this hotel.",5,2021,08,06
216,Trip for a couple.,"Fantastic stay at Number 31, the staff are so helpful and responded promptly to any requests that we made, they gave us a warm welcome, showed us to our room, gave us some historical information on the building in which we stayed, carried our bags to the room and made sure we were happy before leaving us to relax. 

The rooms are perfect for a couples stay, cosy and well decorated. We stayed in an Intimate double and found the room and bathroom perfectly maintained and clean. 

Delia’s breakfast was just as delicious as advertised, it’s made to order and has all the heartiness of a homemade breakfast. Best breakfast I’ve had to date in hospitality. 

After dinner in Dublin City, we really enjoyed a quiet drink from the Honest bar at the sunken couch by the fire and out in the immaculate terrace at night. 

Cannot recommend Number 31 highly enough for a couple stay.",5,2021,08,04
216,Amazing hidden gem,"Overall experience was very very nice. We went just for one night with my boyfriend and stayed in the Fabulous room. Friendly staff, excellent breakfast, clean room and very comfortable bed. Will definitely recommend it to friends! 

Just a few small comments for the hotel:
1. We wanted to watch a movie, but there's no possibility to connect your device to the TV which was disappointing. Only TV channels and music were available. 
2. There's no welcome note or guide in the room – we had to call reception each time we had a question, like WiFi password, TV, etc., and we had to use a reception number instead of a room phone for the same reason. 

Thanks for a lovely stay anyway, we loved it :)",5,2021,08,03
216,"Great venue, staff and location","Great venue in a central location. Staff were very accommodating and friendly! Breakfast was also very nice with a great selection on offer. Rooms are spacious, comfortable and decor was unique and stylish. I Would definitely recommend staying here!",5,2021,08,03
216,Excellent Experience,"We stayed for our wedding for two nights in July. 

Overall, our experience could not have been better. The view of all our wedding guests was that the hotel was one of the best they have ever experienced. The rooms, the courtyard and the mews are stunning and are extremely unique to the city. On the lead up to the wedding, Ana was extremely friendly and made the whole process stress free. Ray went above and beyond what was required of him on the day and we could not have asked for more. The breakfast was the nicest hotel breakfast we have experienced and Dehlia was excellent in this regard also. 

This is a special place for us and our families now and we can't wait until we stay again. Thank you all for everything. 

Brian and Jane",5,2021,08,03
216,Fantastic stay in great city centre location,We had a fantastic stay in Number 31 for a midweek stay in the city. The decor and rooms are so unique and we had one of the best breakfasts we have ever had in a hotel! We will definitely be back for another stay.,5,2021,08,01
216,Professor,"Very professional, friendly and kind staff. 
Very good breakfast. Very comfortable and clean

Very central and close to all amenities including the beautiful st. Stephen’s park. 
Would definitely recommend to my friends and go again",5,2021,08,01
216,Booked for a wedding stay,"We booked Number 31 for two nights for our wedding guests, 25 in total. We really appreciated how accommodating the hotel were and the ease with which they responded to our requests. All our guests loved their stay and loved the hotel!

Delia was fantastic on the morning of the wedding looking after guests' breakfasts and making sure the day got off to a great start. Ana the general manager was very helpful and friendly. Everyone in the hotel was, and we are very glad we booked in Number 31 for such an important occassion.",5,2021,07,29
216,Perfect romantic city get away,"Perfection. We stayed for our honeymoon for two nights - initially planned one but immediately extended because of how much we loved Number 31. Beautiful hotel from head to toe, we especially loved the Art Deco rooms with modern amenities. Fantastic service from every staff member - who went out of their way for us. The eggs Benedict were the best I’ve ever had. Really a hidden gem, can fully recommend for any romantic city get away!! Will definitely be back.",5,2021,07,28
216,The most ideal place to stay when visiting Dublin city centre,"We had such a lovely 2 night stay in number 31. The location is just a short walk from grafton Street and there was free limited parking available which was amazing. We had a toddler and baby with us and staff were so accommodating, we felt very relaxed and welcomed. A highlight of our stay was the delicious breakfast cooked by Delia, she has a delightful manner and the eggs benedict was the nicest I'd tasted! Will definitely be back :)",5,2021,07,27

216,"Charming, modern hotel with stunning architectural design.","From the moment we stepped through the solid  wooden doors, past the beautiful stone wall draped with ivy, I knew this place was somewhere special. The first thing that caught our eye was the sunken seating area looking onto a beautiful fire. The show stopper for both of us had to be the stunning courtyard where we enjoyed a delicious picnic. We stayed in Sam’s room. We loved the modern design- the highlight being the sunken bath tub in the fully tiled bathroom. Our stay was topped off in style with a 5 star breakfast cooked by the lovely Delia, an Offaly nice woman. The fruit bowl was to die for, followed by an excellent cooked breakfast- top class! 12 check out was another added bonus. The staff were very friendly and accommodating throughout our stay. We cannot wait to stay here again- I couldn’t recommend it highly enough.",5,2021,07,22
216,The Perfect Getaway,"Number 31 is just jaw dropping. From the beautiful hotel design, to the staff that couldn’t seem to do enough. I would highly recommend it to people of all ages. Myself and my girlfriend enjoyed a wonderful short stay at the hotel, our room was gorgeous and the breakfast was amazing. We will definitely be returning.",5,2021,07,21

OL",5,2021,07,19
216,"Quirky, comfy, and oozing with laid-back charm","We did a brief overnighter in Dublin to celebrate an anniversary and a milestone birthday with our family. 

Where to start - the place is quirky from the outset with a slightly ""in the know"" entrance to the sunken seating in reception - this is not your average hotel.

We had a lovely warm welcome before being led to our two well appointed rooms in the main townhouse. Comfy beds in a quiet but central location meant we had a fantastic sleep. 

Breakfast was A-M-A-Z-I-N-G! Delia could not do enough for us (vegan, vegetarian, full carnivore) and the flavours!! Cranberry bread is deservedly famous. A big shout out for the porridge (believe us, it was really different) all served with a dose of warm hospitality and some great advice for local excursions.

A real gem of a place.",5,2021,07,14
216,"Stunning room, cosy stay close to town",We had an amazing time at Number 31. The bed was so comfy and the room really special with stunning interiors. The breakfast was spectacular- we had a full Irish and an eggs benedict- both were delicious as was the colourful fresh fruit bowl to start. We will definitely be returning to Number 31.,5,2021,07,07
216,Fabulous place to stay,Gorgeous townhouse right in the city centre. We found it last minute and couldn't believe our luck! Delia's breakfast was amazing! Definitely will stay here again. Amazing outdoor area too with a fabulous outdoor fire.,5,2021,07,07
216,Hidden gem in Dublin,"We stayed in number 31 for three nights. The hotel decor is great, the rooms are lovely. The beds are very comfortable. The outdoor garden is a lovely place to sit in. A real winner for the hotel is delias breakfast. Its superb. The fresh orange juice, fresh fruit salad and the homemade bread are wonderful. The shower door in our room wasnt big enough so lots of water got on the floor. But otherwise everything was perfect and we cant wait to go back again.",5,2021,06,30
216,"Number 31 ""what a hidden gem in Dublin city""","We booked this place for 1 night away to celebrate our 4th wedding anniversary. Were so sorry we didn't book for longer.  Just off leeson st. Its the perfect location to explore Dublin.  We booked a ""fabulous"" double room and that's what it was and more. From the tranquil garden to the breakfast we thoroughly enjoyed the place and we will be back. Enjoy.",5,2021,06,30
216,Amazing stay !,"Went for just one night with my husband, the room was really cozy, the deco was exquisite. All the staff was really friendly even the night porter (we arrived at 1 in the morning after dinner in the city). Best of all was the breakfast! Can wait to stay there again!",5,2021,06,26
216,A hidden gem,"We have just spent our anniversary weekend in this fabulous hotel. Such a treat to be surrounded by such affordable opulence within easy walking distance of the city centre. We loved the whole vibe of the place, from the luxurious rooms to the courtyard garden -  a peaceful spot to read or enjoy a tipple from the honesty bar. The staff were friendly and were on hand for all our needs, without being OTT.  We would love to come back with friends to enjoy an evening in the conversation pit. Delia's breakfast was to die for. Everything was fresh and homemade. I loved the potato cakes and the cranberry loaf, in particular. Nothing was too much trouble for her. When she discovered that my husband was vegan she went out of her way to make him a hearty vegan breakfast (with extra potato cakes for me!) We will definitely be back.",5,2021,06,22
216,An oasis of calm ,"An oasis of calm and opulence in busy bustling Dublin. So central and yet hidden behind a gorgeous door leading into a courtyard. The property itself is so tastefully decorated, and so comfortable. Lovely pillows led to a night of great rest. The breakfast is to die for, we dined in the bright sunny conservatory. Even with all the Covid regulations, the staff managed to make us feel as 'normal' as possible. The attention to detail is everywhere in this hotel. We spent some time following breakfast in the gorgeous garden, listening to bird song and just taking in the colours everywhere in the garden. We feel we have stumbled upon a real gem here, one that we will be sure to return to on other trips to Dublin ",5,2021,06,20
216,Lovely restful jewel in Dublin city,"Just spent a really lovely night in the urban oasis that is Number 31. It is immaculately kept, and clearly painstakingly maintained in both the Georgian and Modernist part. Our twin room was huge and on entering on a humid day, we were greeted by a welcome cool temperature. The  bed linen/ bath robes etc were all top quality, A drink in the ""pit"" later followed an hour sitting out in the tranquil Zen garden, it really was so relaxing. We were looking forward to the renowned breakfast, and Delia's efforts did not disappoint . It was one of the nicest breakfasts have ever had in a guesthouse , Eggs Florentine to die for, Everything clearly very fresh. The staff could not have been more helpful - a special mention to Philip who was so accommodating, even showing us some of the other beautiful rooms for the next time we we return, Both myself and my friend are intending to buy vouchers for friends to stay ... it is a place that deserves lots of business, but not too much so that we cannot come back! Thank you for a really lovely stay.",5,2021,06,11
216,Fabulous Hotel with warm welcome and delicious breakfast!,"We stayed at Number 31 on the June Bank Holiday for my brothers wedding which took place at 25 Fitzwilliam Place, just across the street. Can say without doubt, we were so happy to stay in this beautiful hotel. The staff were so helpful from the moment we arrived. It was so lovely to get up for breakfast the following morning and to be greeted by Delia who made sure we were well fed with her amazing breakfast, there was so much to choose from on her breakfast menu and absolutely loved the cranberry loaf, all the food was delicious, thank you Delia! Both families were so grateful to be so well looked after. Thank you so much for making our weekend so special. We will definitely be returning to this lovely hotel.",5,2021,06,11
216,No 31: A hidden gem,"We have stayed here multiple times over the years and consider No 31 an oasis. I travel for business regularly, but have rarely felt as warmly welcomed. The staff goes to great length to make sure we had everything we needed.

216,"Lovely place, lovely staff but attention to detail needs work.","We stayed one night just before Christmas. The location is great, decor is really interesting and different from the usual stuff you see. 

The staff were very friendly and accommodating. 

Our room was clean and very comfortable. Being on an upper floor, road noise was not such an issue. I wouldn't want to have been on ground or cellar level.  

Breakfast was excellent. Set up for the day.

One thing that did take away from the stay was all of the UHT milk in the room was six months out of date. Not what you'd expect from this...or any hotel for that matter. This was relayed to staff and they gave us some fresh milk.",4,2020,12,26
216,"Clean, close to the city, amazing breakfast, lovely decor!","This was a very enjoyable stay. It was a great location, very close to the city centre.

216,Gorgeous bolt hole in Dublin,"We had a very rare night out in Dublin (blame Covid plus a new puppy!!) and stayed in Number 31. We had a room in the Georgian part (there is also a newer part in the mews) which was likely one of the most comfortable rooms I’ve ever stayed in! Huge comfortable bed, equally huge TV, beautiful decor. Very quiet and restful. The location is convenient to south city centre with lots of restaurants close by. 
Breakfast deserves a special mention - cooked to order. Fresh fruit, homemade breads, all delicious! 
Staff are very pleasant and welcoming. We would highly recommend and would stay again.",5,2020,12,15
216,Beautiful stay in a friendly hotel,"We had a lovely nights stay in No.31. Staff were incredibly friendly, breakfast was delicious and both houses are worth to see alone.

216,Just wow,"You always like to think you know the little hidden gems around; & even though I thought I knew this place fairly well as its across the road from work, I did not have the pleasure of staying over until last night when work commitments dictated.  

Stylist, bespoke & the most relaxed of atmospheres! 

Beautifully appointed rooms with lush bedding, gorgeous touches everywhere with authentic 1920’s pieces including those chandeliers in the main house. 

And then the breakfast! That lady is a star.  Fresh & tasty and that eggs Benedict with mushroom and spinach made my day. Sitting in the conservatory looking out at all the georgian heritage I thought at that moment it was quite possible I could have been the happiest person in Dublin. 10/10 ",5,2020,10,11
216,A true hidden gem!,"We're both from Dublin, and chose  to stay at Number 31 as 'visitors' to our own city for a few days. It turned out to the perfect place - an oasis of calm in the heart of Georgian Dublin. What a privilege to stay in such a beautiful Georgian house, and lounge by the fire in the super-cool modernist mews. 

The staff were great - friendly and relaxed. The breakfasts were amazing and set us up for the whole day (don't plan a lunch!). Perfectly placed for lovely autumn walks up and down the canal, Stephen's Green and the Iveagh Gardens. 

Loved also having the key to the front door on Fitzwilliam Place and coming and going as if we lived there! Treat yourself to a 'Fabulous Double' room here instead of a generic hotel room elsewhere.",5,2020,10,06

Not saying anymore except thank you Jack and team, find the rest out for yourselves!",5,2020,09,15
216,Full of surprises....,"We arrived at number 31 looking for a short weekend getaway to Dublin as we live in Belfast. By far and away the best thing about this terrific boutique hotel is not only 
 the decor but the team who manage this beautiful property with care and affection. From the moment we arrived we were made to feel very looked after and most welcome by Jack. 31 is the perfect springboard for exploring this beautiful city!. We ate at Sole Fish Restaurant (amazing!!) . Breakfast the next morning was prepared by Delia who served up a beautiful breakfast - fresh fruit, yogurt, home made breads and then....the cooked irish breakfast, this will set you up for the day ahead of further exploring. After breakfast we met Ray who manages the hotel and gave us a little sneak peek of the other rooms - they were stunning! - the selection of furniture and detail takes you back in time but your breath away. This place is truly a treasure. My husband and I will ABSOLUTELY return and have now adopted Number 31 as our little Dublin secret escape that we are wanting to share with others, Enjoy enjoy this is by far one of the nicest to places to stay in Dublin.",5,2020,09,13
216,Charming mix of Old World & Modern,"We stayed here for 3 nights! Just a few minutes walk to Stephens Green so a great location. This is an interesting property, a Georgian house with spacious old world styled rooms connects via a charming courtyard to a modern house with cosy contemporary guest rooms, Reception & sitting areas. Our room was a large, beautifully appointed Georgian room with a huge window overlooking the courtyard.  I stayed in a modern room here last year & although It was much smaller & different In style , both rooms are equally comfortable, warm & cosy so next time I’ll be hard pressed to choose which house! Delia’s breakfast is a highlight, fresh fruit, homemade bread & cranberry loaf along with a great choice of savoury dishes. I chose the mushroom frittata each morning, perfectly seasoned, generously filled & so tasty, this lady cooks with love! With no compromise to comfort, I find this hotel a bit more environmentally conscious than most & I like the fact that towels & shower products were not replaced daily which is so wasteful however should you want that or need anything, staff couldn’t be more accommodating. All in all, Number 31 is a gem & I would highly recommend.",4,2020,09,12
216,Unforgettable experience,"My boyfriend and I stayed here 3 nights. First time in Dublin. Hotel central, decorated with taste, staff extremely friendly and helpful, immaculately clean, I could go on with positive notes... 

The breakfast by Delia deserves a special mention. Like dining at the best kind of cafe. Lovely service, delicious plates made with care and skill. 

Would highly recommend Number 31.",5,2020,09,11
216,Amazing hotel,"Me and my fiancée had lovey days in Number 31 last week. First, we were greatly welcomed by all the staff, then when we got to our room, one of the Georgian style bedrooms, we were impressed with the comfort provided.

The breakfast is another point we need to mention, as it offers different mouthwatering options and we’ll definitely miss having it for some weeks.",5,2020,09,07
216,What a find!,As a single traveller this is a perfect place to stay (though great for couples too). Everyone is so friendly and helpful - the breakfasts are yummy - there's a great selection to choose from and Delia takes such good care of you. The dining area is really open and airy space and the hotel itself is quite quirky and unique - little delights round every corner!  It is also  handy to the main shopping area as well as being within striking distance of lovely walks along the canal.  All the necessary the health and safety precautions are in place and the supply of  good umbrellas for your use is a real bonus - just in case you get some traditional Irish weather - which I did I was there!  Thank you so much to everyone in No 31 for such a wonderful stay.,5,2020,08,30
216,Who knew Heaven was tucked away off Leeson Street,"Last year my American friend stayed in number 31 & had a week of Bliss in this hidden gem. How had I never heard about this hotel before!!!!!! I visited and vowed to be back as a guest. Lucky me... I have stayed twice this August. Simply Unique. What a FIND!!! I stayed for work... and I’m secretly hoping to be in Dublin more often.Firstly the hotel is super Clean and staff adhere to all health and safety precautions. Dublin is EMPTY... so it’s the best place to be! How do I describe what a phenomenal experience Number 31 is. The lobby with its sunken seating area is such a wow factor on entry. The terrace garden has a stunning view of Dublin’s Georgian buildings. I sat outside and sipped a glass of red enjoying the tranquility of this hidden spot. My room was chic, stylish & comfortable. I had the best nights sleep... perfect pillows & comfiest bed. The bathroom products are all voya!!! Loved the shower. Breakfast was my Best breakfast experience in a very long time and I travel for work. Thank you Delia for the care and attention you put into your food. Jack thank you kindly for the warmest of welcomes. I unfortunately can’t recall the names of the lovely gentleman & lady in reception on my first night and second night ... I had them run off their feet. So helpful and courteous. This hotel is such a beautiful experience. It’s in the Perfect Dublin City location , staff are so genuine and friendly and this hotel has the wow factor, I LOVE the eclectic yet rustic vibe. A millions thanks to all at 31. I will be recommending Number 31 to ALL my friends and family. Well Done 100%. I left your hotel very content , nourished and with glowing skin!",5,2020,08,29
216,Amazing hotel with a fantastic location,"Just returned back from a wonderful weekend at number 31. Such a beautiful newly renovated with lovely decor! I stayed in room 12 which has a lovely outdoor patio with a great view of the stunning courtyard! The hotel is in a great location close to St. Stephens green and the city centre. The staff in number 31 were so friendly and extremely helpful! I enjoyed an amazing breakfast by Delia, that was delicious and wonderfully presented. Looking forward to visiting again in the near future!",5,2020,08,25
216,Simply the best!,"My Fiancé and I spent a week at No 31.   We had a room on the Mews side that was absolutely gorgeous.  Decor is luxurious, beds are really comfy with good pillows hand the room is spacious and very comfortable (which was essential as we ended up working from here a lot).  The area was exceptionally quiet and the only morning ""noise"" we could hear were the seagulls.

Aside from the magnificent rooms, the hotel has a lovely ""home-away-from-home"" feel.  There's a beautifully manicured garden to relax in, a sunken sofa area with a fireplace, perfect for enjoying a glass of wine from the honesty bar of for reading a book and a lovely conservatory for some quiet moments.

What makes No. 31 THE hotel that we will go back to time and again is the staff.  They are wonderful:  A perfect balance of polished professionalism and friendliness.  We really felt like nothing was too much trouble for them and they made us feel so welcome.  Delia whips up the most PHENOMENAL breakfasts and has the kind of energy that is so uplifting to be around.  

I highly recommend No. 31!",5,2020,08,21
216,5* service and unique accommodation,Stayed here with our families for our wedding in August 2020. The staff were endlessly helpful in accommodating us and organising our stay with Covid uncertainty. The hotel is unique and absolutely beautiful in the centre of Georgian Dublin. It's a hidden gem and offers a completely different experience to any other 5* hotel in the city. We booked out the Sam Stephenson mews house and also took some rooms in the Georgian house. The conversation pit and courtyard are beautiful communal spaces. Can't wait to return as soon as we can!,5,2020,08,19
216,Hidden little Gem,"On a beautiful Friday afternoon I walked into  Number 31, this is a small hotel hidden in the heart of Dublin 2. I received a lovely welcome. My room was beautiful “Sam’s Room” with a beautiful bath. The hotel is very calm & relaxing. I have to give a BIG mention to the breakfast wow it was amazing. I have stayed in lots of hotels & this is my winning breakfast.  I will be booking again soon, like in September 🥰",5,2020,08,17
216,Boutique unique & hidden gem ,"This small profesional run hotel has everything going for it, bang in the Centre nice design, original , best breakfast in town , very nice rooms , and the staff are spot on   I travel to Dublin  all the time for busness and family and will definitely stay in number 31 in the future. 
",5,2020,08,14
216,"Fabulous atmosphere, location and staff","Close to Stephens Green and easy walking distance to various hubs of the city, absolutey wonderful breakfast ,best omlette ever, incredibly helpful and friendly staff and a sense of history, tasteful architecture and atmoshpere about the whole hotel, highy recommended",4,2020,08,09
216,Little oasis just round the corner,"We stayed in Number 31 as a special night away on our own without the kids.  Although we were 15 minutes from home, it felt like a world away - great rooms, cool atmosphere and historic architecture, lovely staff, drink on the terrace, all topped off by Delia's fantastic breakfast. It's a real treat.",5,2020,08,07
216,Best breakfast in town!,Had the most relaxing night here enjoying the quiet courtyard. Nestled in the city centre but a peaceful haven nonetheless. Lovely welcome and an amazing breakfast by Delia! I’ll be back! Would highly recommend a stay if you’re visiting Dublin ,5,2020,08,06
216,When you want something with style & quality this is the best boutique hotel around,"When you are tired of the generic 3-5 Star hotels, where every room is the same and breakfast is easily forgettable Number 31 brings back the excitement and joy of a night away. From beginning to end, it was a superb experience. The beautiful architecture embraces new and old, the interior design pays special attention to every little detail throughout including the amazing artwork furniture, and the staff were exceptional and could not have been nicer to deal with and the location is perfect. Topping our visit off was the delicious homemade breakfast which comprised of top-quality ingredients which once again sets Number 31 above so many other hotels. The cranberry & walnut bread, fresh fruit, natural yogurt, excellent coffee was just to begin with. I would highly recommend a stay at Number 31 to anyone visiting Dublin and look forward to revisiting sometime soon! Thanks, to all the team for doing such a great job!",5,2020,08,06
216,Hidden gem!,"We stayed at number 31 last night as a anniversary treat. I knew it had recently been refurbished, but I was blown away by the hotel. We had a beautiful room in the Georgian part of the hotel- the decor was stunning. Every item of furniture is beautiful and the attention to detail in the design makes it very special. The bed was so comfy and breakfast the next morning was a real treat. The chef Delia prepared a delicious and homemade breakfast- eggs florintine for me and kippers for the hubby. They have really dealt with making the hotel safe very well with plenty of room for social distancing and sanitising stations throughout. I would totally recommend this hotel- a real boutique feel so close to the city centre.",5,2020,08,01
216,"Number 31, an excellent staycation",We stayed for 3 nights in this gorgeous hotel. We had everything we needed and were so well looked after. The hotel decor is gorgeous and it is obviously very well maintained. The breakfasts were amazing and the staff were all friendly and nothing was too much trouble. Location wise this is perfect if you want to be close to the city centre but also enjoy walks along the canal. We can’t wait to stay again.,5,2020,07,29
216,Really recommend it,"Had a beautiful stay in No 31 for two nights. Really great vibe and nice decor. The staff were super nice and added to the stay. Room was very spacious, very clean and quiet. Right in city centre! Would definitely stay again and can’t recommend it enough!",5,2020,07,12
216,Just perfect place to stay,"My mother and I have just returned from an 80th birthday trip back to my mum's childhood in Dublin. I booked No 31 based on previous reviews and it more than exceeded my expectations. The location is perfect - very central and in old Georgian Dublin, beautiful. The staff bar none were all delightful, warm and friendly and could not do enough for us. The rooms were lovely and comfortable with all that we needed. The breakfasts were outstanding - thank you Delia! I have travelled extensively and been fortunate to eat some great food but Delia's breakfasts are the best I have ever had. A lovely, intimate eating space with an abundance of fruits, cereals, cheeses, homemade cranberry loaf, breads and scones. Then the a la carte menu which I defy anyone not to deliberate over because there are just so many fabulous options. Everything cooked perfectly and with a generous heart. We counted our stay in breakfasts rather than nights! Don't hesitate to stay.",5,2020,03,02
216,Just Magic,"Wonderful, quiet, calm,  perfect location that gives you a space to enjoy Dublin. The staff are extremely personable,  helpful but non intrusive which adds to the whole experience.  The breakfast was delicious and the best porridge I have ever had.",5,2020,02,22
216,"Lovely, Unique Property, as good as I had hoped","I had read about Number 31 and was eager to try it.  I tend to be very detailed in my research, and have to admit that some of the older reviews about the property did give a bit of doubt.  Perhaps those reviews were valid at the time, as they have recently done a refurbishment of the property, so I cannot speak to older reviews, but I have to say I was so pleased with this charming little boutique/guest house.  My room was lovely and in wonderful condition, the bathroom was luxurious (and I thought the brown marble was lovely - that had been another reviewer's quibble).  I also fail to understand how anyone could think the rooms are noisy from the street.  Mine was incredibly quiet, with a charming view of the inner courtyard.  The breakfast really is as good as all these reviews say, and the honor bar and fireplace was perfect.   The staff was INCREDIBLY helpful and friendly, and all in all I would not hesitate to stay here again (and am actually planning on it when I return in the spring).   

One additional note - someone in one of the reviews had mentioned that they stayed in a room with only a skylight and was complaining about that fact.   The clerk at the hotel actually showed this room to me as we were chatting.  It's the original room of the architect Sam Stephenson, whose home this once was.  They have kept that room and the bathroom attached to it as he designed it - which I think is a wonderful touch.  I actually think they should play this up more - and include a plaque in the room explaining it.  I love that they have respected his artistic vision with this room while so many other places would have changed it to be more in line with every other hotel room out there.  I was charmed by the hotel even more that they kept his vision intact in that room.",5,2020,02,21
216,A nice stay,"We only stayed one night. Very positive experience. Nice staff available at all hours,  breakfast like at home in a quiet and small setting, room very clean and spacious, with great bathroom and shower.",5,2020,02,18
216,Best Breakfast in Dublin!,"We always stay at 31 when we visit Dublin. The hotel is unique to the city, comfortable, friendly and welcoming, a real home away from home. The breakfast is always the highlight, home cooked delicious food, served with a smile and a chat in a beautiful setting. Could not recommend more highly.",5,2020,02,08
216,City hideaway ,"Lovely quiet building, old Georgian house and quirky modern mews with disco style bar and sunken sofas. Breakfast was delicious and the highlight of the stay.
Slightly expensive but excellent location and staff.",4,2019,11,11
216,Bathroom Not So Grand,"I enjoyed my stay at Number 31, the casual atmosphere, helpful, kind staff, nicely refurbished news room.  Interaction with staff was particularly good, and the breakfast room  is perfect, set up for friendly. conversation with other guests. 
My room was overall very comfortable. But it lacked surface space, so nowhere to make a real/coffee, even though this facility was provided (hidden in the cupboard).
The bathroom was very unfortunate, and after ten days I was glad to leave it behind.  Bad planning made it almost impossible to get into the shower recess, don't book this room if you're a large person, and the shower head sprayed water everywhere except where needed.  It's hard to understand how this could happen in what appeared to be a recent renovation,  I put it down to quirky Irish thinking.
I stayed in July and paid 312 euros for a standard double room, an astonishing amount.
Despite this I recommend Number 31, but stay in the non tourist season if you don't want to pay through the nose.",3,2019,09,14
216,Magical Honeymoon at Number 31,"Number 31 is the perfect hidden-away gem in Dublin. It is beyond cozy, but still chic and elegant. We stayed here on our honeymoon in April and could not have been more pleased. Centrally-located with friendly staff and a beautiful courtyard, it was a perfect home while we explored the city. And you absolutely won't find a better breakfast!",5,2019,09,11
216,Always grand,"Have stayed here twice.  Location is fantastic, easy 15 minute walk to Trinity College through St Stephen's Green.  Staff friendly, helpful and accommodating, with good tips for eating and drinking.  The sunken lounge, courtyard and buiding are all lovely but the glory of the place is the excellent breakfast in the conservatory on a sunny morning.  Enjoyed our stay again.",5,2019,09,08
216,my absolute favorite boutique hotel in Dublin,"No. 31 has been my hotel of choice in Dublin for the past decade. Its the type of experience where one feels as if they've been at a favorite artsy friend's home rather than a boring corporate room or faux ""elegant"" place. Lovely Delia's cook-to-order breakfasts are amazing, she offers something for everyone: from full Irish to mushroom fritata, plus a healthy buffet of fruits, yogurt & cereals. Her cranberry tea bread is something I dream about when I'm back home in the states! 

The range of rooms on offer are lovely: one part of the hotel is a proper Georgian townhouse with an elegant blend of past & present, the other part is a uniquely renovated former architect's home. The two spaces are joined by a lovely green courtyard. I had the fortune to stay recently, on the last night before they closed for renovation. I can't wait to see the refreshed beauty at No. 31. when I return in November.",5,2019,09,08
216,Very Charming & Good Food Too!,"Always nice to stay somewhere that reflects where you are rather than generic corporate digs.  The breakfast is also quite good, and they are happy to make what you want instead of just what’s on the menu (I asked for eggs with portobello mushrooms and a nice pile of arugula instead of the “Full Irish” breakfast - no problem at all).  The staff are all quite helpful without being in your face. Would definitely go back.",5,2019,09,04
216,Meh,"Old hotel, so-so design, musty room, expensive, not so worth the money. I would stay at the Green next time.  

I was in Dublin on business, and I got the room closest to the front of the hotel. Large variation in room quality, this one surely needs a good renovation. 
",1,2019,08,28
216,Quiet location close to downtown Dublin,"Located in the Georgian area of Dublin and a few minutes walk from St Stephens Green, Number 31 is a welcoming city hotel. The sunken lounge area with an honesty bar is a pleasant place to have a chat and wind down. The breakfast is excellent with a healthy buffet of fruits and cereals and a cook to order menu. French press coffee just right. Respectfully renovated. If you prefer a unique stay to a generic chain hotel this is a good choice. Minor irritations could easily be fixed such as more lighting in bedroom and bedside table seemed a bit small. ",4,2019,08,27
216,A great stay in Dublin!,"Number 31!!!! Charming, close to downtown, good variety of restaurants within walking distances, The most helpful staff one could ever hope to meet.  Fabulous breakfast (included with stay)!  There should be a ""Delia""  in charge of every good hotel kitchen, but there is only one of her and she is the greatest!  Enjoy fresh natural ingredients, perfect Eggs Bennie, the best cranberry citrus bread ever, and so much more. Hope to come back again!",4,2019,08,22
216,A Fascinating Place to Stay....,"""Number 31"" is a modestly-sized upmarket Guest-House, located very close to Dublin's landmark St. Stephen's Green, and an extremely interesting place to stay, for a variety of reasons.

First, the older part, is a renovated Georgian House, looking out onto the fairly well-preserved Fitzwilliam Place, which dates from the late 18th/early 19th centuries.The newer part - connected by a Courtyard - is a redevelopment of what was probably a Coach-House to the original Building. Entry to ""Number 31"" is through this newer section, where the Reception & Public Areas are located, as well as a number of relatively modern Bedrooms.

What's of further interest is that this combination of old and not so old spaces came about through the efforts of a famous, controversial and colourful Irish Architect, who located his Offices in the Georgian House, and constructed his living-quarters in the Coach-House/Mews area, back in the 1960/70s. Sam Stephenson was responsible for the design of a number of significant Buildings in Dublin's 1970s : most notably what became The Central Bank Building on Dame Street, the Electricity Supply Board's HQ on Fitzwilliam Street, and Dublin Corporation's Offices on Wood Quay.

These additions to Dublin's skyline were all regarded as exemplifying what's called ""Brutalist Architecture"", and were generally quite controversial. It's particularly ironic that Stephenson's design for the ESB Headquarters on Fitzwilliam Street, unapologetically razed a series of Georgian Houses, destroying a truly beautiful streetscape, while he practised his profession from a preserved Georgian House, just a stone's throw away!

We stayed at ""Number 31"" for two nights (Bed & Breakfast at prices quite similar to some Boutique Hotels, it should be said) on an August Weekend - we were celebrating a Birthday as ""Tourists in our own City"" - and, overall, quite enjoyed the experience.

The layout is a bit disconcerting and frustrating : there are lots of steps on the way from the modern bit to the Georgian House (with malfunctioning lighting along the way), the decor is a bit dull and depressing, and clearly it is timely that the Guest House is about to undertake major refurbishment in the next few months.

But, it's fair to say that, apart from location and history, there are reasons to recommend this establishment. A major one is the effort they make at Breakfast, which is served at communal tables in the newer section : Delia (who has, apparently been here for 22 years) makes a huge effort to not just deliver tasty, fresh fare, but also engages warmly and helpfully with guests, suggesting how they might best enjoy the City of Dublin, and we also found Reception Staff Shannon & Adriana pleasant and interested in engaging with those who stay here - which is not that common, it should be said.

We hope to have the opportunity to visit the refurbished and renovated ""Number 31"".",4,2019,08,18
216,Mary Sheridan,We love No 31.  It is so well situated for Shops and Restaurants and a short walk to Stephan’s Green. The Staff are wonderful and very helpful. The breakfast has to be the best in Dublin.  It has the added bonus of a City Garden which is lovely to sit outside!  Our favorite place to stay in Dublin.,5,2019,08,16
216,Laid back!,"Lovely quiet hotel in pleasant area. Not far from the centre of town, location for us was ideal. Very clean tidy room, small but sensibly furnished. Good shower. Great breakfast, cleverly laid out breakfast room, inviting guests to sit together and chat!! Staff were super smart, polite and helpful without being intrusive giving the hotel a laid back friendly vibe. Would stay again but choose a room in the older part.",5,2019,08,12
216,Charming hotel with excellent service ,"We really enjoyed our stay in this charming hotel.The decor is stylish and individual rather than bland and corporate.Service was excellent from all the members of staff we encountered including arranging an early breakfast on our departure day.
The breakfast menu is great, all hot dishes cooked to order and amazing cranberry bread. We would definitely return.",5,2019,08,09
216,The Good and the Bad,"First the good.  High level of service and availability of staff, good sized rooms, good access to common areas even after hours, tasty & timely breakfast and pretty good location - 20 min walk to Grafton Street in downtown Dublin.  Now the bad.  Ceiling paint in our room was peeling/flaking, tile in hallway near stairs had a sizable hole and was indented and chipped, no individual cooling unit in room so had to leave window open but no screens and next to fire escape which is not comforting, and there was virtually no parking,",3,2019,08,05
216,Second time was even better,"From the moment you arrive at #31 it’s special. A hideaway. A glorious mews and Georgian house a stroll away from Dublin’s elegance. The staff cannot do enough to make you welcome and we had a family room that felt like our own suite. Breakfast was sublime and there was joy everywhere in the hotel. An honesty bar, sunken couched area, lush garden and light everywhere. Car park on site and a 12 o clock check out. Perfect. My partners first time in Dublin and it couldn’t have been better. I can’t wait to stay at #31 for a third time and lap it up. Top place in Dublin.",5,2019,08,05
216,Quiet hotel in a central location,"Location
The hotel is located centrally, a 10 minute walk to St. Stephens Green. Nevertheless, it is in a quiet neighborhood as it is on the south side of the Green. The hotel entrance is on a side street with free hotel parking for 4 vehicles. Most tour buses pick up tourists from Stephens Green.

Hotel
You ring a bell to be let in to the hotel compound (the front desk is staffed 24/7). The hotel is made up of two buildings, one modern (in the front) and one Georgian (in the back), connected by a garden. The lobby is funky with a sunken sitting area, and a Nespresso coffee machine. 
Rooms
We stayed in the Georgian part of the hotel as we needed larger rooms with an extra bed. The double room we stayed in had 15-foot ceilings. It was quite large with a desk, a chest of drawers, and a tall cupboard for hanging clothes. The cupboard also had a safe. There were enough hangers. Overall, there is enough storage space for clothes. The room also had an extra bed, two chairs and a chaise lounge. The bathroom was of adequate size. It had a single sink with sufficient shelf space for two persons’ toiletries. Hot and cold water comes mixed from a single faucet in the sink, unlike in countryside hotels. There was a shower stall with a glass panel covering half the side (expect some water splashing outside the shower area). There are no elevators on the Georgian side which was not a problem for us.

Breakfast
Breakfast is served in the modern side. There are three large tables, two inside and one on a lovely patio. There were about half a dozen hot breakfast items, all of which were excellent. Make sure to try Delia’ cranberry bread. You can order egg preparations not on the menu (example, fried eggs). Cold items such as cereals and fruit are also available although the selection was not large. Coffee and tea are served at the table. The coffee was quite good.

Service
Service was always friendly and courteous, both at the front desk and the breakfast area. The front desk staff helped out by taking our luggage up to our room and calling cabs for us.

Irritants
Our room was somewhat dark as the lighting was inadequate for such a large room. Be aware that there is no air-conditioning on the Georgian side which was not a problem for us as we kept the window open at night. None of these were deal breakers for us.

Overall
We highly recommend this hotel. We will stay here again if we were to visit Dublin. Our overall rating is 4.75 stars.",5,2019,07,30
216,Don't miss Delia's delicious breakfast!,"Behind the wall in the center of Dublin opens another world.
It is not far from the Stephens Green.
Everything is nicely arranged and clean and in between the both houses is a little beautiful garden.
The receptionists were very helpful with tips and bookings.",4,2019,07,29
216,Noisy summer seagulls,"The toilet and reading lamp didn't work properly. Bring ear plugs during the summer seagull season. Breakfast is first class. Try for a Georgian room, they have impressive architecture and interior design. Lovely courtyard.",3,2019,07,24
216,Shabby,"Something is wrong with Number 31.  How can this hotel possibly be rated 4 stars?  It’s old and tired – in need of a major renovation.  Some of the floor tiles are broken, furniture is dinged, wallpaper and paint are peeling off the walls, etc., etc.  As noted by another reviewer, the modernist double room is not as advertised.  This place feels more like a hostel than a hotel.  The breakfast is average – nothing special.  Overall a major disappointment.",3,2019,07,24
216,Not all rooms are born equal,"I would have liked to give a higher rating as the hotel is well located, the staff is very friendly and they serve a great breakfast. Unfortunately the quality of the main item, meaning the room, was quite poor and appears to be inconsistent as there seem to be some very nice ones. We were unlucky I guess and got stuck in the basement, and I mean basement, with two opaque windows one of which could not be opened and I was unsure about the other. It was situated right below the creaky entrance to the building so we could enjoy the sound of people entering and leaving. We did get a defective light bulb replaced in the bathroom but it did not last long due probably to some short circuit. 
It started off well with a welcome tea when we arrived but we had of course to wait for the room to be ready at 3PM, and it was not worth the wait.",3,2019,07,23
216,Perfection at Number 31,"From arrival to check out we had a magnificent experience at Number 31.  The public spaces, including the sunken living room of my dreams, are well thought out and beautifully executed.  The ""family room"" that we stayed in had plenty of space and was very well designed.  The Hastens beds are excellent.  Number 31 is centrally located and a gem!  And breakfast...wow!",5,2019,07,22
216,A Very Pleasant Hotel,"If you want a chain hotel room, forget this hotel.  We enjoy staying at hotels that have character and we were very pleased with our room.  The breakfast was excellent and the staff was very helpful whenever we needed something.  Also, the location is convenient.",4,2019,07,20
216,It's a gamble,"I feel I should write two reviews. We booked a Modernist Double. First night the room we were given did not match the photos. It was tiny, on the fourth floor of the building across the garden. There was no room for us to unpack our cases. The shower was so small I couldn’t move, or get my head from under the water. It was clean and the bed comfortable. The lady on reception was polite, and caring, but she couldn’t move us that night, but she’d try for the next night. A 1 star night. 
Before breakfast we asked to be moved. She showed us another small room, that wasn’t worth moving too. Then she said a room was being cleaned. We looked at it, and it was marvelous. It was large, with plenty of room to unpack. Much more like the photos. The shower was large and there were two sinks in the bath room. There was even a patio door to a private mini-garden. A 5 star night.
The breakfasts were excellent, and the staff were wonderful. There must be a large variation in the rooms, and it is a gamble which one you get. Good luck.",3,2019,07,16
216,disappointed,"The images and marketing do not accurately describe the B&B. The room was dark, small and poor layout. The shower was open and dangerous as water spray all over the floor. We had an upgraded room. There was no elevator and we had to climb 3 flights of stairs. i had a broken wrist so this was not easy. We had to also cross outside to get to our room and the ground was all uneven with stones and brick and hard to transport luggage. They advertise that their food is outstanding at breakfast but it was nothing extraordinary. We would not stay at this property again.",2,2019,07,14
216,Nothing good to say!!,"I booked a stay for the 6th of July, they emailed me and I didn’t understand what it meant, so I called to confirm the booking but when i arrived they had given the room away, the lady I spoke to was rude and told me it the room was the last one, I nearly missed my concert. She refused to help me with anything else and rudely asked me to leave. I will never book this place again, I had travelled from France just to see the concert and I don’t appreciate being spoken to in that manner, i would appreciate if I talked to someone with more sense and manners. The customer service needs to improve!!",1,2019,07,09
216,Delia’s Cranberry cake the best thing,"Delia’s cranberry cake tops off a great breakfast at this slightly faded elegant Georgian townhouse hotel. Well situated, lovely staff, we had a large room which was beautifully dark and quiet with great pillows. Our neighbours, with the street view, weren’t so lucky. Hotel structure our favourite kind of building, tall ceilings etc but does need some attention. Outside space limited but welcome and private. Not sure if it’s worth the price, expected slightly more but I could be out of touch.",4,2019,07,09
216,Very Disappointed ,"We had very high hopes for our stay at number 31. We are a couple with young children and we made a long journey to Dublin to enjoy a special night away together. 

The room we were given should not be utilised as accommodation in our opinion as it is directly below the entrance to where many of the hotel rooms are located. The traffic in and out of the building generates loud noise which continued through the night until approx 4.30am and recommenced at approx 7am. 

We advised reception of our sleepless night and the staff member advised she would speak to the manager. We were provided a credit of approx 15 Euro on checkout which we advised was not a satisfactory resolution. The manager did not take the time to speak to us. We paid 270 Euro for a sleepless night and began our long journey home.....we won’t visit here again. We left very unhappy with this experience - very poor customer service when you have a problem. ",1,2019,07,04
216,Truly Wonderful Stay,"What lies behind door ""Number 31"" is simply WONDERFUL!  Within minutes of our arrival dinner reservations were being made on our behalf, received the warmest hospitality, enjoyed delicious breakfasts and will definitely be returning.  Within great proximity to restaurants, pubs & shopping.  Booked both the family & a king room in the  Victorian section.  You'll be greatly pleased visiting this gem!",5,2019,07,03
216,"Great ambience, great staff","It consists of a couple of small villas connected by a garden. A bit old, with squeaky floorboards and aged decor. But that’s exactly what made it quite enjoyable. It felt a bit like being at my gran parents home, surrounded by a lovely staff and a very good à la carte breakfast (keep that in mind if you think it is seems pricer that other options).
Large clean room, wonderful bed, and nice bathroom. Can’t really complain about anything about the room.
It is very close to the city center, but not super close (about 10 mins walk). However there is a bus stop just in front of it.
I would definitely go back if I were to stay in Dublin again.",5,2019,07,02
216,Our stay at Number 31,"We had a lovely stay at Number 31. Very accommodating and friendly. Comforting atmosphere and guest services. All employees were helpful and genuine. The breakfast is to die for. So many fresh, clean options all perfected. Getting to talk with the chef, Delia, was a true treat. We would recommend this place as a great little getaway, tucked away, right in the city of Dublin.",5,2019,07,02
216,2 great visits,"We stayed at 31 at the beginning and end of our trips to Dublin - enjoyed it both times.  Staff were really great - Ireland was the last leg of 3 on our trip and we flew thru Dublin on our way to our 1st stop in Athens.  We had heavy luggage for a bike trip that we didn't need to lug around Europe, the Staff at 31 sent a drive to the the Airport to grab our extra bags from us during our 2 hour lay-over.   The bags were in our room 10 days later when we checked in.

Breakfast is awesome.",5,2019,07,01
216,"Comfortable spot, Great location","Very tidy and comfortable room, great location For walkers, extremely tasty breakfast, warm and helpful welcome as we arrived early from overseas, helpful recommendations, many good restaurants nearby.  We would definitely use again.",5,2019,06,25
216,Enjoyable,"This property is quite old but very quaint, our room was on the top floor, which was quite a track with no lift available, however young lady did offer to carry bags up. Breakfast was in a dining room which had 2 long tables, whereby you sat down next to other guests , this was quite nice as the close proximity enabled you to chat to others, however this could be off putting for some people who like their own space.  Breakfast was nice , but I wouldn't say any different than any other good guesthouse.  Orange juice was not available in jugs, the waiter brought out a glass when I asked for it.  I was so looking forward to the selection of breads I had been reading about, however my husband & I were given 2 slices of bread between us, one wheaten & one cranberry , this was quite disappointing , as I had expected a selection which we could choose from, we had to ask for toast .  When we went down to check out , the lady had already taken the bill from my credit card which I had made the original booking with , when in fact I had a gift voucher to use.  She had to then proceed to cancel the transaction which took sometime.  Location of the propert is excellent , 10 minutes walk to Stephens green , grafton street etc. while we enjoyed our stay I feel it's too expensive for a guest house facility only.",3,2019,06,24
216,Lovely. Delia!,"This spot is comfy, lovely, great location. But the highlight is Delia’s food! I have never had cranberry loaf done like that! I couldn’t get enough of it. 
Beautiful little touches around this whole spot.",5,2019,06,18
216,Loved it!,"Really enjoyed our stay here.  We had a large family room at the back of the property, that was very quiet and comfortable.  The breakfast was superb.  The staff were extremely helpful and welcoming to our two rambunctious girls, ages 10 and 12.  There is a lovely, quiet courtyard where you can sit and just enjoy the breeze.  So relaxing!  The only minor complaint I would have is the shower had no way to control the water that got everywhere.  However, I would still stay here again and would recommend it to anyone traveling to Dublin.",5,2019,06,17
216,You need to stay here!,"I had read the reviews prior to arriving and knew it would be nice. However, it far exceeded my expectations! 
Phenomenal staff, spacious and beautiful rooms, and quiet. Well located. Short walk to Trinity College, Grafton street and many other desirable places.
",5,2019,06,17
216,Perfect stay,"First trip away with our new born and picked this spot for its good location, parking and beautiful setting anticipating spending more time in the hotel than normal. It did not disappoint!! Incredibly helpful staff, stunning room with super cosy beds, gorgeous breakfast, just all round great! 
Highly recommend and I hope we find an excuse to come back.",5,2019,06,12
216,Spacious rooms and a delicious breakfast,"Number 31 is conveniently located just a short walk from St. Stephen's Green (and steps away from a Starbucks). The rooms are spacious, quiet, and comfortably furnished but the star of the show is Delia and her delicious breakfasts. Each of our mornings we were greeted to coffee from a french press, a choice of many egg dishes including poached eggs, omelets, or scrambled eggs with smoked salmon. We loved talking to Delia and receiving her insider tips. As far as we're concerned, Number 31 is the only place to stay if you're visiting Dublin.",5,2019,06,10
216,Great customer service and wonderful breakfasts!,My husband got sick and they made a doctor's appointment for him on the same day! Brought a dinner delivery to our hotel room and Delia's breakfasts were just delicious! Staff could not have been more gracious yet knowledgeable as well. Good for you all Number 31!,5,2019,06,07
216,Breakfast is prime; Number 31 delivers,"Delia's kitchen is the ace in the deck, as far as I'm concerned! Yes, the sunken mod living room, back garden, comfortable cosy rooms, and a good out-of-the-way yet convenient location to the city centre and to the Grand Canal all add. But what wins me over is Delia's personal touch when it comes to serving Number 31's guests.",4,2019,06,05
216,Fabulous Night Stay,"My family had just 1 night in Dublin and selected Number 31 after the reviews we read.  We were not disappointed! The hospitality we received from everyone we interacted with was amazing and the room (4 single beds) was spacious enough for all of us and included a small sitting area.  Our flight out of Dublin required us to check out at 4:30 AM, but the hotel still provided us with hot coffee and breakfast pastries to take to-go. If we're ever back in Dublin we'll definitely plan on staying at Number 31 again!",5,2019,06,05
216,A remarkable and memorable stay,"Greeted by charming Bernardo at the front door at 6AM, we were home-- served coffee in the charming courtyard as the sky lightened.  The accomodations were clean and comfortable; breakfast was exceptional-- service kind and attentive.
The location is excellent-- a stroll to St Stephen's park for your introduction to Dublin; excellent restaurants were recommended; National Concert Hall around the corner.

However, it is the staff at Number 31, under the watchful and caring eye of the manager, Jenny, that creates the responsive and helpful spirit: Patricio, Shannon, Telethia--and another staff member whose name, with my apology, escapes me, effortlessly storing our luggage as we departed for a getaway to Dingle.   A truly outstanding team.The challenge is how to linger in the charming, sunken reception area, when touring awaits!  
Your home away from home while you visit Ireland.  

Tom",5,2019,06,02
216,Hidden Gem in Central Dublin,"We walked through the beautiful doors of Number 31 to a efficient, warm and caring welcome.  Both the friends we had brought and my husband and I, had a wonderful stay in this hotel.
We stayed in the mews, the beds so comfortable, bathroom beautiful, our friends in the main georgian house, with larger rooms, a walk across a beautiful garden with seating areas.
Breakfast was delicious with a wonderful cook, Delia, who absolutely topped the morning of my birthday by cooking a perfect breakfast but added a delicious glass of Buck’s Fizz.
I felt a little pressure bringing friends to show them my country but would have no hesitation in recommending this hotel.",5,2019,06,02
216,Fabulous little find,"We have just had 3 nights at number 31, the location is a short walk from all the major attractions, the beauty about this place is that it’s so convenient but not in the middle of the full on tourist traps... staff fantastically helpful and friendly, and breakfast an absolute winner- Delia not only a Masterchef but also an excellent itinerary planner...!! She deserves a serious salary increase..!!😋😋👍👍",5,2019,06,01
216,Becky and Sam Compton,We're so pleased we've discovered No 31! We were shown around by a wonderful young lady as we want to return with our parents late summer. Heard too that it's being revamped in the Autumn so it will be even better. A great breakfast in a lovely bright room. Thanks to you all!,5,2019,05,29
216,You'll leave feeling like you have a family in Dublin!,"Staying at Number 31 was by far one of the best parts of our trip to Ireland. The rooms are beautiful and very clean. Delea is an absolute treasure! She is such a kind soul and is able to prepare some of the best breakfast you will ever eat. The Staff is so helpful and treats you like family. Several times my father and I would just stand in the lobby and laugh and carry on with whoever was working that day. I hope everyone at Number 31 knows how special you made our trip to Ireland. I'll be back one day and there is no place in all of Ireland I would rather stay! 

- Love from Tennessee, Charles Tyler Peek",5,2019,05,25
216,It's all about the personal service,"Number 31 is our favorite place to stay when visiting Dublin. Of course location, ambience, uniqueness and an amazing brekkie by Delia are part of the reason we continue to return. The larger draw is the way the staff, under the expert leadership of Jennie Cotter, provide care and comfort to guests, ensuring that they have everything they need to make the most out of their stay at Number 31 and in Dublin. One ritual in particular stands out as Jennie checks in with guests during the morning meal to see how they got on the previous day and also offer ideas, assurances and alternatives to the adventures ahead.  This is precious insider info she offers freely to all her guests. That her interest is genuine and sincere makes her stand out from other hotels where management is merely polite. Jennie treats visitors and staff as if they were family. Leading by example, her staff then does the same. The combined efforts provide guests with a home away from home rather than a night at a hotel. Which makes sense since it was originally a Georgian home... it takes a dedicated and personable manager to maintain the hospitality of that era, bringing it everyday to the modern world. My advice is to treat yourself and book your room here now.",5,2019,05,20
216,Lovely stay at Number 31,My husband and I stayed in early May for 2 nights. We had a lovely view out on the garden and at the back of the Edwardian townhouses (one of which also has rooms connected to Number 31).  We were welcomed in the lobby by the fire with fresh tea and coffee - which was much appreciated having just done the overnight flight from the US. The breakfasts were yummy! Thank You!!,5,2019,05,18
216,Very helpful hosts.,We stayed for 3 nights. Very comfortable accommodation and friendly and helpful staff. Delicious breakfast with good range of options.  Well sited for access to most attractions and only 5 minutes walk to an excellent restaurant - Suesey St.,5,2019,05,17
216,A highlight of our trip to Ireland,"Great hotel - Great service, great food, great staff. Example 1: When we showed up, they made us feel welcome by offering and serving us tea/coffee before they even started checking us in. It was so and relaxing. Example 2: Delia (the chef) made a fantastic breakfast and then took the time - on her own initiative - to help us plan transportation to the airport. Highly recommended.",5,2019,05,15
216,Great service.  fun place.,"This is eclectic, but really nice.  Our room was in the adjoining Georgian home, which had huge ceilings and windows.  Everything is modern, however.  Inexpensive too.  Breakfast is very good, served on an enclosed outdoor terrace.  The staff here went above and beyond to wait on us.  Wouldn't dream of having you carry your own bags, etc.",5,2019,05,09
216,Amazing first stop in Ireland! ,"We just had the pleasure of staying 3 nights at Number 31 to kick off our Ireland vacation. The staff was more then welcoming and helpful. I suspect Delia's phenomenal breakfast will be hard to beat during the rest of our trip! Our room was very comfortable and spotless. We enjoyed the old world charm of the Georgian townhouse. They plan on renovation in the fall, but we were very pleased with the current state. The location is excellent to see the sights of Dublin. Far enough away from the hustle and bustle but all the sights are in easy walking distance still. We highly recommend staying at Number 31 and will come back should we stay in Dublin again.",5,2019,05,08
216,It's all about the service and the breakfast!,"Delia serves up delicious breakfasts including amazing rhubarb compote and the best oatmeal in Ireland along with many terrific egg dishes.
Staff is very attentive and offered good restaurant suggestions for lunch and dinner, i.e. Canal Bank Cafe.
The property is in a great area of Dublin. The rooms are due for a refresh.",4,2019,05,05
216,Georgian Enjoyment,"This beautiful glimpse of a more gracious era was our base for a week in Dublin. The location was superb - away from the throng yet only a short walk to St Stephen's Green. While all of the staff could not do enough, the heart of this boutique hotel is the kitchen. Each morning the wonderful Delia, ably assisted by Edan, sent us out fully fortified to face our Dublin day. Just brilliant.",5,2019,05,03
216,Beautiful boutique hotel,We had a lovely 2 nights in one of the deluxe double rooms. The breakfast was the best I've had in any hotel. Staff are friendly and welcoming and it was a very handy location near at Stephen's green.,5,2019,04,28
216,"Charming property, superb staff","Number 31 was a treat after two weeks of B&Bs around Ireland.  Our initial room (14) was not to my liking.  It had no windows, only a skylight, which made me feel claustrophobic.  The next morning the staff graciously moved us into the Georgian wing.  We left our belongings packed up and when we returned from a day of sightseeing they had it all done for us!  New room, with a window.  The place is very nicely appointed, I loved the fireplace in the lobby.  We sat with a final nightcap upon returning from dinner one night and didn't want to leave.  The property is showing a little wear, but I understand renovations start in September and I'm guessing it is going to be even better than it currently is.  The breakfast was excellent, interesting menu choices, all delicious. It's also an excellent location, two blocks down Leeson Street from St. Stephen's Green.  You are close to everything, but far enough that you get some quiet for your evening.   But mostly Number 31 is special because of the staff--attentive, welcoming, helpful--they make you feel at home and go out of their way to make your stay fabulous.  Highly recommend.",5,2019,04,25
216,A well located jewel with the best breakfast in Ireland ,"This stylish boutique hotel is hidden away right where you want to be to explore Dublin on foot or by transit.  
It is quiet and very mid-century hip. 
Jeanie and her staff will brighten your day and make things easy. 
The Irish breakfast is the best ever. Don’t miss the eggs Benedict with mushrooms. They are perfectly cooked. Light and al dente. Worth every penny. ",5,2019,04,24
216,Wonderful stay and lovely staff,"Thank you to all the staff at number 31! We are a group of 8 with grandparents and kids. Enjoyed the stay, staff are very helpful with moving luggages, suggestion for restaurants. Conveniently located. Ambience is great at the hotel, cosy and comfortable. I would recommend the bigger rooms on the ground floor if you have big luggage. High ceiling and lovely overall! Thank you everyone for making our stay so memorable!",5,2019,04,24
216,Amazing staff and amazing hotel,"I can't recommend Number 31 highly enough. They were so attentive and welcoming, Our plans chopped and changed a few times but Number 31 were able to accommodate everything. The rooms are beautiful, the breakfasts are amazing but best of all are the people who work there. Haven't got a single bad thing to say about them, will definetely book them again next time I'm in Dublin.",5,2019,04,23
216,Wonderful boutique hotel,We had a wonderful stay at Number 31 for a short week-end break. The boutique hotel is delightful and all of the staff charming and most helpful. We were given  excellent restaurant  suggestions and also enjoyed the superb breakfasts at the hotel. Really nothing was too much trouble and we would highly reccomend  to others. Linda and Paul.,5,2019,04,19
216,Best breakfast,"We just had our Second stay here staff couldn't do enough , they as so helpful and friendly .room was lovely and clean and the breakfast is unbeatable,I would definatly recommend anyone to stay here !",5,2019,04,18
216,Great breakfast and delightful staff,This hotel is in a lovely old Georgian house renovated nicely. The staff were friendly and hospitable from the moment we arrived till the moment we left. There is a bus stop within metres but we chose to walk everywhere as the weather was dry if somewhat chilly. The city attractions were within walking distance. The staff made good suggestions for restaurants and pubs. The breakfasts were outstanding with an a la carte menu rather than the usual buffet each meal was cooked beautifully. The only drawback was that we were on the third floor which meant four flights to climb. If your knees are ok this is not a problem it in facts help work off the delicious breakfast if not it might be best to ask for a room lower down. We recommend this hotel where all the details are attended too diligently it was a delight to stay for three nights. ,5,2019,04,15
216,A secret oasis in a great location,"My fiancé and I stayed for one night whilst visiting Dublin for the first time. From the moment you arrive to the moment you leave this luxurious feeling guesthouse you’re treated with warmth by the staff. There’s a real personal feeling about everything from the sunken lounge with its various large coffee table books to peruse at your leisure and the ‘honesty bar’ where you can help yourself to alcoholic drinks just by leaving a note of your room number. Our bedroom was gorgeous and the bathroom more so with it’s dark opulent panelling and large rainfall style shower that had an abundance of pressure (important point for me when rating rooms). 
The breakfast was as good as they speculated if not better. I had the Eggs Benedict whilst my fiancé had the Eggs Florentine, both delicious! I didn’t have the renowned Cranberry and Walnut loaf due to my ‘Jeff Goldblum from the fly’ allergic reaction I have to nuts but my fiancé reported it was amazing! 
After we checked out, they let us leave our bags with them whilst we went exploring Dublin. We ended up coming back earlier than expected due to the persistent rain (no fun when walking around Dublin Zoo) and we spent an hour having complementary tea and coffee by the roaring fire while we dried out and charged our phones before they sorted out a taxi to the airport for us. 
All in all Number 31 made an already good weekend into a great weekend with their hospitality, great food and accommodating our every need! Would recommend to anyone visiting the great city of Dublin! ",5,2019,04,08
216,Another memorable stay st Number 31,"We decided to spend the last night of our trip in Dublin and stay at Number 31sfter remembering it’s great location and Delia’s delicious breakfasts. We were not disappointed. The property is stylish, comfortable, clean, well located, and can be a great value. Our greeter, Shannon, could not have been more welcoming, warm and accommodating. We watched her, alone that afternoon, handle the checking in of guests, popping up to answer the doorbell, carrying luggage, while offering us suggestions for dinner and letting us know she’d inform the breakfast staff that we’d need to eat and leave a bit early in the morning. She handled everything so cheerfully and with grace. As with the country of Ireland, famous for it’s beauty and it’s hospitality, it truly is the people that make the place. These two ladies really made us so glad we chose Number 31, and helped to make our last night day/night a trip highlight once again.",5,2019,04,08
216,"Wonderful, cozy home-base in Dublin (+incredible breakfast!)","We stayed at Number 31 for 5 nights while we explored Dublin by foot and neighboring cities and towns by train. It is a wonderful establishment -- great location, fantastic restaurants close by, thoughtful, kind, and friendly staff. And the breakfast truly is superb. We ate our way through the menu and tried everything. Delia, Number 31's chef, is the heart and soul of this inn -- she's a talented chef with attentive kitchen staff who make every guest feel extra special every single morning. I can't wait to visit again.",5,2019,04,07
216,Lovely Boutique Hotel in the heart of Dublin ,"We had a fantastic stay at Number 31. This beautiful little boutique hotel is very stylish, cozy and well situated in the heart of Dublin. The entire staff was helpful and super friendly. We really enjoyed the breakfast and the relaxing atmosphere. Special thank you to the GM Jennie who was very accommodating and welcoming. We will be back! ",5,2019,04,07
216,Excellent place to stay in Dublin,This is a very lovely place to stay in Dublin. It is centrally located and we were able to walk to many museums and historical sights. The rooms are very attractive and well maintained. The common living area is beautiful and there is always a fire burning. The staff are exceptionally welcoming and helpful. They know their guests by name and offer very helpful suggestions about what sights or areas might be of interest to visit. The morning we arrived we were greeted with a pot of tea and lovely cranberry bread to enjoy until our room was ready ( about 30 minutes--we arrived early). The daily breakfasts prepared by Delia are fabulous and filling--you wont need lunch. Overall this was an excellent experience and we will most definitely stay here whenever we return to Dublin.,5,2019,03,31
216,Great stay,"Located in the trendy neighbourhood of Portobello. Not far from all the action (Temple Bar, museums, galleries, etc.) Peaceful, quiet, cozy and tastefully done. Good breakfast. Loads to things to do around.",4,2019,03,31
216,Lovely guesthouse with really friendly staff,Loved my visit here from having a parking space right outside the front door to friendly staff. Lovely cosy room and an absolutely belting breakfast. Eggs benedict to die for. Great coffee and really moreish cranberry bread. Really well positioned close to Dublin City centre,5,2019,03,31
216,Hidden treasure,"We enjoyed our stay at number 31 for a lot of reasons: the incredibly heartily and helpful staff, the cozy and modern interior design, Delia's amazing breakfast and the location very close to the city center. Thx for being so accommodating when we had to change plans! ❤️",5,2019,03,29
216,Didn’t want to leave,I’ve been coming to Dublin for years and I don’t know how I didn’t know about this place. It’s a real find. The building was the home of modernist Irish architect Sam Stephenson so it feels like being in someone’s very cool house... because you are! The staff (esp manager Jenny Cotter) were so helpful and warm and breakfast by Delia was delicious - don’t know what she does to the porridge but it’s the tastiest I’ve ever eaten. I stayed in Sam Stephenson’s former bedroom complete with sunken bath - it was fabulous. A real original. Xx,5,2019,03,28
216,2 night stay,"This is a true gem!  It was a treat for my Mum; we had such a lovely stay here in this beautiful hotel.  I really couldn't fault the service or the location - a short walk to Grafton Street through Stephens Green.  The breakfast was without doubt the best we have had anywhere - and I really mean anywhere! Everthing was cooked fresh and perfectly, and the choice on the buffet table was incredible.  The lovely chef even packaged us up some homemade cake to take to my poorly Aunt.  These kind of personal touches were typical of our stay.  This recommendation can't come highly enough.  I look forward to returning to enjoy the stunning lounge area again, sitting by the open fire with a drink from the honesty bar - oh, and of course another Number 31 breakfast!!",5,2019,03,27
216,Girls Weekend,"Return trip to Number 31. Lovely as always. The sunken living room, the peat fire, the honor bar, the comfy beds and pillows + Delia’s delectable brekkies. We’ll be back sooner than you think! Happy St. Patrick’s Day.",5,2019,03,26
216,"Outstanding service, amazing people, wonderful location","I never write reviews, but I am for Number 31. Lovely space in a great location. The people, however, were the best part. Jennie, Delia, Shannon, and others, made our stay exceptional and the breakfasts are truly extraordinary. 

We miss you all already and your lovely city! Can't wait to return.",5,2019,03,26
216,Just as wonderful as eight years ago!,"I first stayed at Number 31 eight years ago on my first trip to Ireland, and after considering a few other options for this trip, decided to stay here again when I came back with my husband. So glad I did! The breakfasts are just as amazing and the hospitality is even better. They’ve created such a warm and welcome place, it feels like staying at a friend’s home rather than a B&B. Will definitely stay again when we come back with our kids someday! ",5,2019,03,25
216,Customer service done right,"I rarely write reviews, but for Number 31 I feel it is necessary. From the moment we arrived at the hotel we were looked after. We arrived at around 10am, not expecting our room to be ready so was pleasantly surprised when it was. The room was lovely and clean and the bed super comfy. The hotel had such a nice quaint feel to it, not over-crowded and a relaxing atmosphere. As a meat-eater, the breakfasts are outstanding. Made better by the friendly service and great conversation with the staff. The only thing throughout our trip is possibly having more hot options at breakfast for veggies and vegans. Ultimately, if you're looking for a nice hotel to stay in on your own or as a couple, this place ticks all the boxes. I'll definitely be returning if I ever get back to Dublin, and I've already recommended Number 31 to friends and family.",5,2019,03,24
216,Superlative Care and Cuisine,"Number 31 is irreplaceable. Cool and spacious with a retro chic, it is designed to take you away from the mundane. Our group relished every day there. My personal experience far surpassed any of the good experiences I’ve had in multiple fine hotels. I’d injured my hip, and steps and stairs caused pain. Immediately the manager, Jenny, put me in a lovely first floor room at no extra cost. Since I couldn’t climb stairs to the breakfast room, she decreed that breakfast be brought down to me. It was served in a beautiful foyer by the fire. 

A word about the breakfast. It was simply the best I’d eaten anywhere. I imagined the chef to be a tall French genius with a white fluffy hat. Instead a smiling redhead named Delia came down the stairs one morning to introduce herself. She was the chef. Like Jenny, and receptionists Teadora and Shannon, Delia embodied the informal warmth that made me feel so uniquely cared for. The unusually delicious food and very attentive service (Hiram was a great example of this) made it wonderful to come home to 31 after a marvelous day in Dublin. I miss this great place with the exquisite breakfasts.",5,2019,03,22
216,More shabby than chic,"The main area has a kind of cool retro vibe but our tiny room on the 4th floor had peeling paint, uneven flooring and no room for two people and luggage. The carpets and furniture are worn and breakfast was forgettable.  I would give fewer stars but for the staff.  Everyone was very nice and hospitable.",3,2019,03,22
216,Felt like home,"I'm at expat who travels a bit so I am use to staying in hotels.  I rarely leave reviews but, I have been absolutely blown away by the 5 star service and hospitality that I have been shown.  I was welcomed by a lovely lady who couldn't be more helpful.  The room was great, I suffer from insomnia so a comfy bed and pillows are key and I was not disappointed. Now for my faveroute part, the breakfast is 5* no question!  Delia and the staff are like a family and you can see how much personal pride they take.  The food, service and staff in my opinion are exemplary and this the only hotel I will stay in when I return to Dublin again.",5,2019,03,22
216,A true definition of excellent hospitality!,"When we arrived, we were greeted by the friendly GM, Ms Jennie Cotter and her friendly and helpful team. The check in was smooth and quick and we were ushered to the lovely high-ceiling room with such comfy beds and pillows, just what you needed after the long flights! Breakfast was excellent, again encountered with great customer service oriented and polite staff! Perfect location. Could not fault our stay. Everything was perfect. Will definitely stay here if we ever be in Dublin again. So all in all, this property is highly recommended!",5,2019,03,19
216,"Great Stay, Perfect Dublin Getaway","Room at the top floor overlooking the courtyard. The service was great, someone was always there to help, day or night. The breakfast is amazing. There is a great common area to lounge while you wait for taxis/transportation.  The location is ideal for walking to Grafton Street as well.  The staff helped with our bags right away and offered assistance with directions and food recommendations.  The breakfast really is out of this world.",5,2019,03,15
216,Amazing find & Breakfast,"We loved our room and stay at Number 31.  The hosts were extremely helpful and got us a reservation at Matt the Thresher on Valentine's day last minute.  Best seafood we had during our trip!

Great Shower and bed.  Breakfast every morning was our highlight!  Everything you could want and so fresh.

I could not recommend this place more for it's service, location, cost, and food!",5,2019,03,14
216,Cosy and friendly central location,"A long weekend in Dublin was made all the better by staying at Number 31. Conveniently located South of Stephens Green but and easy walk to the centre, this converted pair of houses, joined by a narrow garden is a gem. Universally charming and friendly staff were helpful and welcoming. The room (11) was at garden level, quiet, comfortable and cosy with doors out onto a small patio. The breakfast is indeed very good, although a little bit busy and rushed at peak time on a Sunday morning. An honesty bar is a nice touch and offers of freshly made tea and coffee were well received. Ideally located for the National Concert Hall and there is an airport coach stop (757) a short walk away.",5,2019,03,12
216,Hidden gem!,We really enjoyed our stay at Number 31. The staff are warm & welcoming & walked us to our rooms. The rooms are beautiful. We stayed in the Georgian house. Rooms had all the amenities you need & the beds are really comfortable. Breakfast was amazing & the highlight of our stay. We will definitely be returning.,5,2019,03,12
216,Our favorite hotel in Dublin.,"A secret boutique gem hidden in a fantastic, safe and central part of Dublin.  I do corporate bookings for our company, and all our guests demand to be there. Not only is it convenient, but it's oozing with unique charm, interesting history and pleasant hospitality. Everyone raves about the delicious breakfast and the fun 'honesty' bar. Stay here. You won't regret it!",5,2019,03,08
216,Right at home!,"This one of the friendliest, most guest-focused hotels I’ve ever encountered, and I have traveled a great deal for both business and pleasure. The staff is delightful. Extremely friendly, helpful, and knowledgeable. Breakfast with the wonderful Delia is not to be missed - it’s every bit as delicious as promoted, and Delia and her staff go out of their way to check in on plans for the day and share some tips and insider details (example:  ask her about rhymes related to the magpie).  The manager Jennie is also a pleasure - exceedingly gracious and helpful. Very well run little hotel. 

Number 31 is an excellent base for exploring Dublin, on foot or otherwise. 

We stayed in the Georgian wing and would recommend it over the contemporary wing - the newer rooms do have something of a musty smell that I’m sure will be corrected with the renovation in the fall. We struggled to get the heat right in the Georgian rooms, and the shower has an oversized shower head that creates water issues no matter how careful you are. My travel mates missed having electrical outlets in the bathroom or near any of the mirrors.  Minor annoyances that will be addressed I’m sure. 

We will happily return!",5,2019,03,02
216,Lovely stay,"Great location for staying over in Dublin, warm welcome, lovely breakfast, original rooms, nice quiet neighbourhoud at walking distance from city center, restaurants and shopping.  Defenitely a nice experience",5,2019,02,26
216,Central yet quiet,"This is a very nice bed and breakfast / hotel in a right in the centre of Dublin, just a few minutes walk from St Stevens Green.
Even though it is central, it is still quiet and it is possible to have a very good night's sleep there. My room was facing the street, yet there was hardly any noise from the street. The insulation must be very good.
The room and the bathroom both were a good size. The toiletries in the bathroom were nice, the shower powerful, and the towels large and fluffy.
The breakfast is of very high quality. I had Eggs Benedict one morning and Scrambled Eggs with Smoked Salmon another morning. Both were prepared to a high standard.
The only little complaint with my stay was the behaviour of the young man serving the breakfast. The first morning he seemed to make a conscious effort to ignore me. I really had to fight to get his attention and be able to order my breakfast. He was OK the second morning though.
Everybody at the reception was friendly and professional. The assisted me a couple of times in getting taxis and booked a table for me at Matt The Thresher. That was an excellent recommendation from them for a place to eat.
Overall Number 31 is highly recommended.",4,2019,02,22
216,An utterly perfect lodging experience,"We have traveled widely, and we can say without qualification that our five nights at Number 31 were exemplary in every way.  From our unexpectedly early arrival through our early, early morning departure, we were met with exceptional hospitality and kindness, deep and useful knowledge of the full range of experiences available in Dublin and the surrounding environs, a constant pleasant willingness to offer assistance, and the sort of personalized, warm attention one might hope for from the closest friends.  To a person, the staff are engaging, well-informed, and highly competent.  While we would happily name each individual who touched our lives, we will mention only two as exemplars of the entire staff: Jenny, the general manager, is superb in every way, and consistently went well beyond what was required to make our stay pleasant, full of fun and interest, and simple. To quote her phrase for others, she's a superstar. And there's no way of conveying what the nonpareil Delia brings to the place.  From her unrivaled skill as master chef to her massive logistical competence, she's a once-in-a-lifetime host.  We would not even consider staying anywhere else in Dublin. In fact, this experience alone is enough to have us already planning a return trip to Ireland.",5,2019,02,20
216,Lovely stay,"Stayed for one night. Everything was perfect. Landed there with a punctured tyre. Staff have been very helpful they gave me a garage number and directions. They also allowed me to park my car for few hours after we checked out. Breakfast is great. Comfy beds and huge bathroom. And most importantly, everybody meets with a smile. Will definitely go back again.",5,2019,02,20
216,Fantastic hotel with incredible staff,"This place exceeded our expectations.  Staff was ultra accommodating, scrumptious breakfasts, and in a location close to everything.  We walked to Grafton Street and other local attractions daily.
We will definitely be back.
Thanks for the porridge, Deirdre!",5,2019,02,19
216,A fabulous hidden gem,"We have now stayed at Number 31 twice and will most definitely do so again. From the moment you find the 'secret door' in Leeson Close you are welcomed in to what can only be described as a 'family' environment. It's obvious that the team love working at 31 and it really shows in the service and friendly atmosphere. The public areas are clean and funky in an architecturally interesting style (we loved the 70s-style 'conversation pit' and the well-stocked little honesty bar. They brought us coffee and gorgeous cake while we waited for our room (we arrived early and they dd everything possible to make us welcome). Our room, in the old Georgian building had soaring ceilings, huge windows with a great view of the 'old Dublin' street scene; the bed is as soft and pillowy as a cloud! Some furnishings could do with an update, but everything is designed with real flair - with some design classics and engaging artworks thrown in - not the usual 'hotelly' prints!  If you like architecture, mid-century design and a bit of Georgian chic, this is the place for you. Breakfast is just the best anywhere; cooked fresh, quality ingredients (the sausages are something else) and everyone is obviously deeply proud of their cook / 'mammy' in the kitchen!  If you're expecting identikit hotel features, this isn't for you. It's like staying with some cool friends who happen to have a beautiful home in the heart of Dublin. We will definitely return!",5,2019,02,13
216,I found my go-to place to stay when in Dublin !,"Great location, wonderful quirky guest house with THE most amazing breakfast and the staff were so welcoming and friendly.  The loaction is a 5 min walk from Stephen's Green and just off the main street.  Once that big wooden door swung open we were in a little city centre haven.  We'll be back, thanks you for a wondeful stay.  Catherine & Orlaith.",5,2019,02,07
216,Magical place,"Tucked away down a quiet road, but close to St Stephen’s Green, Number 31 is a quite lovely place to stay. Fantastic, beautifully cooked breakfast (with my son having a second dish of scrambled eggs!) and lovely staff to welcome and help you. Thanks to all - we’ll be back!",5,2019,02,06
216,Ideal and Genteel,"Number 31, under the superb direction of Jenny and her amiable capable staff, is THE place to stay for those who enjoy a historical house updated with all the 21st century luxuries the historical housing commission allows, a post modern mew for gathering with rooftop community seating for the amazing brekkie entrees conjured by Delia. Add to this an ideal location for taking in the city of Dublin with the lure of this respite only a few steps away. Brilliant for families, couples, singles, a reunion of friends. My advice? Book now. I've already confirmed my return.",5,2019,02,03
216,Best B&B in Ireland,"Excellent breakfast, excellent lobby, excellent service, excellent room.
Great central location, bus to city centre and airport from front door. It has a well stocked honesty bar. The front house is an original Georgian building.",5,2019,01,31
216,Hidden gem near the heart of Dublin,"Loved staying here. Good value for Dublin, cool vibe, honesty bar stocking craft gin and ales and fresh breakfast. Staff lovely. Handy for runs along the canal, town centre and the aviva stadium. Will return for sure.",5,2019,01,31
216,A beautiful hidden gem close to city centre,"Booked a night away. We caught a airport shuttle coach and stop was very conveniently located. Hotel tucked away and beautiful, tranquil entrance of a mews.

Staff were very friendly and checked us into our room - first floor room 8. It was only after we went for a walk into town and returned that we realised that our room was directly outside the breakfast area and above reception. We were hoping for a lie in (night without kids!) so asked if it would be noisy - they moved us without us even suggesting it. We were moved to the Georgian part of the hotel which is accessed across a courtyard and up a fair few number of stairs. We didn't mind at all and it was lovely and quiet and tucked away. Agree with shower - shower heads are great but not great if you don't want to wash your hair - a shower cap would have been great.

Staff offered advice on where to go and next morning breakfast was lovely - all made to order. They let us keep our luggage at the hotel until we were ready to depart from the airport.

Would definitely recommend and will return. Thank you for being so accommodating!",4,2019,01,29
216,Cool charme of the 60’s,"I stayed here with my family for three nights. I must say - the sunken living room in the common area is the highlight - a really great design! The overall house (having been a private home, designed by Irish architect Sam Stephenson) was very unique and impressive! We would have loved to have found out more about the history of the house - as this was not really promoted but is such a great aspect of the hotel!
The staff is friendly and super helpful!

Unfortunately the down side were the rooms. We had two rooms in the main building, right by the main entrance. Not only was it small and dark, but also you were able to hear everything that was going on around us. Whenever the doorbell rang, it sounded like it was in our room and woke us up. Similar with our parents having a normal conversation in the room next to us; (my parents and I were able to discuss breakfast plans through the wall..). On top of that our room was directly underneath the breakfast area, which meant we were woken up by footsteps quite early each morning.

The breakfast itself however was great! As we were there for three mornings - we tried all different breakfast foods - and they were all delicious!
Location is also superb! Just a short walk from the city center! Overall, I would return, but only if staying in the Georgian Building (a separate building also belonging to the hotel), as the noise was really an issue for us. This noise comes from living in a 1960’s house which is architecturally impressive but was probably not meant for hosting multiple guests at a time. That is why sleeping in the other building would most likely be ideal.

Thank you again to the wonderful staff and hopefully we will be back soon to give it another try! A special shoutout to the wonderful Delia, who not only told us all about the history of the house, but also made the best breakfast!
",3,2019,01,27
216,A hidden gem!,"I had the treat of staying in this fabulous bijou townhouse just before Christmas when myself & the girls hit the town with seasonal vigour! My favourite part of the evening was the fireside G&T in the honesty bar in No 31 before we even went out, and my second favourite part was walking across the road, removing my high heels & heading for a very comfortable bed within minutes of deciding to call it a night! The staff could not have been nicer & its clear that under Jenny's super efficient management, this hidden gem may not stay hidden for long. Thanks No. 31!",5,2019,01,25
216,Great Personal Service,"We stayed here in Nov. but w/holidays just getting to review.  What stuck out the most was how incredibly personable and helpful the staff were.  Jenny was a gem but this clearly rubbed off onto to all the staff (Teodora, sticks out). Whenever we had a question, they jumped to work and solved it with a smile and great advice (was much needed with some of the weather we had).  Great suggestions on food and fun. Our room was quite large, clean and like stepping back in time (in a good way).  Delia's breakfast .. i'll just second what everyone else has said, amazing!  Could use a full Irish right now on this cold day at home. Number 31 is in great location, close to everything but off just far enough for quiet and peace. Places close by we loved ... Matt the Thrashers Seafood, O'Donoghues for drinks and traditional music, the Little Kitchen close by hidden gem, great value, Etto for Italian",5,2019,01,20
216,Beautiful!,The best way to start of our honeymoon! Absolutely gorgeous accommodation with even more beautiful staff! Delia not only made delicious breakfast for us but went out of her way to help us plan our day and organise our transfers. Could not recommend number 31 more highly!,5,2019,01,18
216,Mrs,"Just spent a lovely two night stay at 31. Room very comfortable, ground floor room no 11.  Staff all very welcoming and helpful. The breakfasts were amazing and in particular was Deliah’s Cranberry loaf which was absolutely delicious, we couldn’t get enough of it. Our 1 year old grandson was with us and Deliah made him scrambled egg and little soldiers every morning. We have stayed at 31 in the past and will b back. Ten minutes walk and u r in the centre of Dublin.",5,2019,01,16
216,Great place and amazing staff!,"Couldn’t recommend Number 31 more! Have stayed a number of times in the past as it is in a great location for visiting Dublin. However, this was our first time staying as a family of 3 with our 1 year old son and the staff could not have done more to accommodate us. Delia’s breakfast’s were delicious and she even made Frederick smaller portions each morning. We will definitely be back. Thank you for a lovely stay!",5,2019,01,16
216,A mixed bag that is difficult to review,"I’m having trouble with this review as the staff, position and breakfast all receive top marks but the rooms fell way short of my expectations. My issue is with the oversell on the rooms where the pictures on the booking form did not represent the small box attic rooms we were allocated. Indeed, having booked three rooms for three nights, five months out, I would have thought we may have been allocated good rooms. Not so. I felt that having been allocated two attic rooms up six flights of stairs, we had drawn the short straw. Our other room, two floors down, was a little more like the picture in my mind. This is not a hotel for the faint-hearted. If you have dickie knees, respiratory problems or a mobility disability, think again. Before reaching our room - six flights of stairs from the ground floor - we had to navigate reception. This is up two short flights of stairs, features a sunken lounge down yet more steps, and sits beside the entrance to the breakfast room that is entered via even more stairs. Add to that, to access the rooms, you need to descend a flight of stairs to the court yard and then climb again to reach the ground floor of the accommodation. To some extent, staff do accommodate this issue by being on-hand for moving gear. My other issue is that design wins over practicality. The raised reception and sunken lounge do not add value to this hotel. Also, the dark carpets and poor lighting makes descent into the basement room a little precarious. Lighting issues continue into the rooms where there are parts of the room (where your suitcase goes) that are dark with no illumination. Showers in the attic rooms also pose a problem. The shower heads are so big that - without keeping the door open - there is nowhere to put your head without getting your hair wet. However, management was very receptive to our concerns and changed one of the attic rooms allocated for my elderly parents to a basement room (there is another story here). On our final night, our remaining attic room was swapped for another opposite our third room two flights down. This move did however highlight an issue with the fire escape. It can only be accessed through one room on each floor.",3,2019,01,10
216,"An incredible stay, 5/5","One of the best guesthouses I have ever stayed in! The room was comfortable and well decorated, the breakfast was amazing with nothing being too much trouble. I would definitely recommend the Eggs Benedict if you are staying for breakfast. 

The hotel manager was amazing, she was always checking we were comfortable with our room and happy with our experience. The rooms are gorgeous with all amenities included, such as tea, coffee and shower products. 

This guesthouse is located in a very central location. We used the Airlink bus and could get dropped about 10 minutes away near St Stephen's Green, I would 100% recommend doing this as well as the DoDublin pass. 

If you are staying in Dublin please stay here! I will definitely be coming back 

- Thank you for such an amazing stay :)",5,2019,01,10
216,"A lovely stay, near the heart of Dublin","Just back from two days at Number 31, whilst exploring Dublin. 

We received a friendly welcome on arrival at the hotel, and were shown to a room in the Georgian townhouse section, across the courtyard.  We had a really nice sized room, with an excellent bed and a well-appointed bathroom. 

Breakfast was superb - with lots of options, including freshly cooked products that were delicious, alongside juice and decent coffee. 

In the evening we used the sunken lounge area, with its welcome fireplace and the lovely honesty bar.  Enjoying a post-dinner glass of wine in this area is a really nice treat.  

All the members of staff that we met throughout our stay were friendly and helpful, arranging transport and giving us recommendations for the city. Special thanks to Theodora for her warm welcome, and Katrina for her recommendation of the 'no-name' bar in Dublin which was a great place to enjoy pre-dinner drinks. 

My only piece of feedback is that the shower in our room was pretty hard to use without flooding the bathroom - might be worth checking that out.",4,2019,01,08
216,Minimal room in Dublin with good breakfast,"Our room was quite small with almost no space to put luggage or store clothing.  It was up 3 flights of stairs in a building across a courtyard from the reception area.  We were disappointed in the location, having hoped it would be closer to major museums, cathedrals and restaurants.  Notwithstanding its shortfalls, it had a truly outstanding breakfast, with anything you wanted cooked to order.",3,2019,01,05
216,Two days at Number 31," The new manager whose name I've forgotten (perhaps it was Jenny?) made what could have been an unpleasant experience an very enjoyable one.  When we arrived we were greeted by a very friendly and helpful person who checked us in and showed us our room in the coach house section of the hotel.   We were dismayed to find that the toilet seat was broken (as in: wouldn't stay on the toilet).  We advised the person at the desk, who said she would arrange for it to be repaired.  We returned from dinner to learn that the handyman was not available and that the toilet would not be repaired to the following day.  In addition, we quickly found that the room had virtually no sound insulation -- we could hear our next door neighbor quite clearly, who was coughing and who had the TV on for much of the night.  In addition, the bathroom was designed with a very oddly placed step.   The next morning the manager was speaking to the guests at breakfast.  When we told her about our issues she was extremely sympathetic and highly accommodating.  She said she was aware of the problem with the toilet seat as well as the problem with the insulation and the poorly designed bathroom.  She let us know that she shared our concerns about the room and that the issues were being looked into.  In addition, she promptly offered to move us to a new room in the more gracious Georgian Townhouse -- a very nice upgrade.  She also arranged for us to have a breakfast the next morning, notwithstanding the fact that we had to check out prior to when breakfast was typically served (and our many thanks to the chef for coming in early and for preparing the very tasty meal).  In sum, we give management and the kitchen extremely high marks; the Georgian townhouse room was beautiful; and the lounge area with the fireplace in the coach house section was quite inviting and comfortable.  Hopefully the issues in the coach house have been addressed or if you can get a room in the Georgian building, we would highly recommend this inn.",4,2019,01,05
216,"Never fails to,please","We love staying at no 31.  Of course the amazing breakfast are not to be missed. Bowls do fresh fruit, wonderful cooked breakfasts - homemade bread and cranberry bread all made by Delia.  We had another comfortable stay from 10 December for three nights.  If in Dublin will always return to No 31.",5,2019,01,04
216,Fabulous,"My only hesitation in recommending this fab place is that it may become too popular! It's a really fantastic location. The bedroom was really elegant. Gorgeous venue, super staff and the breakfast was divine. Can't recommend it highly enough",5,2019,01,02
216,Simply Amazing,"We stayed at Number 31 last weekend. We simply love the place. Our room was amazing. The atmosphere was fab. The highlight of our whole stay was of course Delia's mouthwatering breakfast. Delia, you are an absolute gem of a woman. Thank you so much for our breakfast, they were Devine and oh my goodness that bread... We loved it Saturday morning and with our extended family when we arrived home! Your skill is a joy and your warmth and kindness will stay with us and bring us back to Number 31 forever more. Thank you.

Damian and Martina.",5,2018,12,20
216,Really nice stay in Dublin,"U cannot get a better experience of really nice Traditional personal Irish hospitality a hotel can offer. 
We stayed for 2 nights & wish we could stay longer but time don’t permit.
Our standard room is cosy, warm, spacious & really comfy. It’s the usual winter outside but we don’t hear or feel it from our room. A homely place u look forward to return after a busy day out, or anytime to get back to recharge before heading out again.
 First you cannot get past the really friendly reception & a honesty bar, with free the best Christmas cake by Delia ( her family secret recipe)  biscuits, coffee & tea, delicious
The secret is Delia’s kitchen for fresh daily breakfast cooked to your order. U cannot miss this award winning meal, so delicious & carefully prepared, enjoy Delia’s warm Irish pampering. To recharge you for the day ahead. So have a really nice time & like us, give thanks for such warm personal hospitality u will not see elsewhere in this country. 
Thank you Delia & the other team members (from the smiling warm reception to the cleaners & others behind the scene) at hotel number 31.
It’s centrally located just feet away from the main road, transportation, shopping & restaurants. All within walking distance. But away enough to have really quiet comfy rooms.
U cannot get a better place to stay in Ireland. Don’t miss out Enjoy when in Dublin.",5,2018,12,18
216,Jennie and team provide hospitality unparalleled anywhere!,"Welcoming smiles and a warm fire set the travel experience at #31. Combining a Georgian house and mews the rooms are comfortable with feathered bedding and plush towels . A pot to heat your tea water encourages sitting for a spell. The breakfasts are superb with Delia creating a fresh, dazzling experience. Can I like my plate? 
Do ask when making your reservation if you need a room on a lower floor. I was up 4 flights of stairs and got my exercise in.
Jennie and front desk call cabs, offer suggestions for sightseeing and will work to resolve any concerns.
This hotel/ B&B wrote the book on hospitality and it’s a hit.",5,2018,12,07
216,What a wonderful place,"What a gorgeous place to stay. 

The staff were absolutely outstanding - so welcoming and friendly with a real ""can do"" attitude. Extra shout out to Jennie who helped me so much with logistics. 

Breakfast was delicious, great choice of food. 

Rooms - the beds were exceptionally comfortable with very luxurious bed linen. 

Cant wait to stay again, was a real home from home.",5,2018,12,03
216,Lovely Stay at a Wonderful Location ,"My husband and I had the pleasure of staying at Number 31 for 8 nights and we were floored with the level of professionalism and care the staff showed us from the beginning. When we checked in, we were alerted that, due to availability, we would be staying in the room we requested for one night(lovely, but facing the street, so there was some minor noise from traffic), then they would move us next door to a larger and more quiet room for the duration of our stay (picture attached). They even offered to move our luggage for us while we were out exploring the next day so we could come back and not have to worry about anything. 
The breakfast was superb each morning. My husband would wake up and be more excited about the breakfast than anything! Delia even stepped out of the kitchen to greet us and ask about our plans for the day and give us tips or suggestions. It was Delia’s suggestion that we leave earlier than we intended on our last morning that guaranteed we made our flight on time. Jennie, the manager, would also make it a point to greet each guest at breakfast and also took a genuine interest in plans being made. The staff offered to make reservations or help us purchase tickets for attractions at several points during our stay. At one point during our stay, the water went out (it’s an old house. It happens). Even though I am sure the staff was stressed, they never let it show. They remained professional and apologetic at all times and the water was fixed by that evening. To say that they made us feel like family is an understatement. We will never be able say enough good things about the staff at Number 31. 

With all of this being said, there are some pros and cons to staying at this location. I am hoping that this honesty will help others in making a good choice when selecting somewhere to stay in Dublin because every traveler has different needs and you should NEVER book a location based on pictures alone. 

Pros:
Wonderful breakfast, amazing staff, great amenities, parking on site (4 spaces and you may have to leave your keys so they can move your car to let another guest out), great sized rooms and bathrooms

Cons:
Noise- you are staying in an older house that has very little in way of noise reduction. You will hear doors opening and closing, people talking in the hallway, moving around above you and there may even be some street noise based on where your room is. If you are bringing children or need complete silence to sleep, this may not be the place for you 
Location-My husband and I did not consider this a con, but others may. A lot of locations (Grafton Street, St. Stephen’s Green, Saint Patrick’s Cathedral)are at least 1 kilometer from the hotel and traffic is terrible. We walked everywhere, which we had anticipated and ENJOYED, but if you are used to driving everywhere and finding parking easily, you may want to pick a place to stay that is closer to attractions where they offer parking. 

Number 31 is also undergoing extensive renovations at this time, so we are excited to see what they do to improve the rooms and we cannot wait to come back again!

216,Low Key and Cosy,Highly recommend this low key and cosy spot to stay in Dublin. Not much around it but short walk to everything. Breakfast is fabulous as everyone else has mentioned. Coffee in room and lobby. Beds comfy and heat in room worked well. Could use better lighting in the bathroom. Very quiet for a city spot.,4,2018,11,27
216,A wonderful stay--I wish it could have been longer!,"My husband and I finished up a week of touring Ireland with two days in Dublin, and we chose Number 31 as our ""home base"" for the final leg of our trip. It was a wonderful experience from start to finish, and I only wish we could have stayed longer. We had room 31 in the Georgian House, and it was perfectly set up for us from the moment we arrived. The bed was large and comfortable, the bathroom was compact but high-end throughout, and the location of Number 31 cannot be topped. We were able to walk everywhere we wanted to visit in Dublin with no problem, but we didn't have to stay in the super-touristy areas of the city. Being able to come back to our quiet room in a lovely, laid-back neighborhood made our overall visit that much better. The staff was friendly and helpful but not overbearing, and the breakfasts were just as good as the other reviewers have said. You know if a bacon-and-egg-loving American like me wanted a second helping of **porridge**, it MUST be great!

(And I seriously have no idea what the negative reviews of this place are about--if you look at them closely, it seems like they mostly come from entitled tourists who thought they were checking into a Hilton instead of a lovely and intimate guesthouse. The ones who post pictures of a crack in the wall or a scuff on the floor drive me crazy--those sorts of things come with any old house, and to imply that they are indicative of the condition of the entire establishment is incorrect and extremely rude. This is a lovely place to stay and you can sense the work that the owners and staff put into it every moment you are there. The rooms at Number 31 are exactly what you need after a day of walking around Dublin, the traffic noise is minimal [did these reviewers not understand how cities work?], the atmosphere is warm and inviting, the breakfast is insanely good, and the service is top-notch from check-in to check-out. Should we return to Dublin, we will absolutely book a room here again.)",5,2018,11,25
216,What a gem!,"A beautifully-styled building with an incredible welcome, a great breakfast and unique rooms.

Ours had a very high ceiling, fireplace and tons of atmosphere. Also a very large room by city hotel standards.

In short? We loved it 

Tip: If you see mixed reviews, check the photos before you travel. This is a one-off hotel in a period building and not a slick, corporate venue. And it’s all the better for it. 

Wonderful!

216,All the comforts...,"My partner and I stayed at Number 31 for five nights. We felt welcome from the moment we stepped through the door. Our room was clean and comfortable. The property itself was beautiful, and within easy walking distance of St. Stephen's Green, Trinity College, and other sights. The staff were very helpful with dinner suggestions/ reservations. Delia’s breakfast menu was the best we’ve seen/tasted in our travels through Europe - not to be missed.

Well done to you all and we will definitely be back again!",4,2018,11,01
216,Feeling at home like a Dub,"Nothing from the entrance to our room on the georgian building reminded us an hotel, but a charming staff always available to help. We have been delighted by the atmosphere in our room and the light filtering through the large window overlooking the garden. 
And the delicious homemade freshly cooked breakfast deserved the time to enjoy it. Our favorite being the porridge.
We will come again for our next stay.

216,"Tired, Tatty, and very disappointing ","OK all.... be wary.... this is presented very well online (understandably), however it is verging on misrepresentative. Maybe this is acceptable for a remote American investor, however not us. The room we were offered was just awful... the alternatives after a gentle complaint, not much of an improvement. The establishment is a little tatty, tired, and a little dirty and nothing like the photos on Booking.com. Would hate anybody else to be as disappointed as us. 

On the plus side, staff were very good, and the B&B (That’s what it is really is) is reasonably close to the city Centre.",2,2018,10,27
216,"Charmingly quirky B&B with great staff, breakfast, location, details","We stayed at Number 31 for two nights last week and loved our stay. Nothing more needs to be said about their incredible breakfast -- it's a good as you've heard -- as is their staff who are cheerful, helpful, friendly, and professional. We stayed in the modern building and it was definitely a good choice as our room was gorgeous but did not suffer from the need for a freshen as some reviews here mention. We loved it, found the bed incredibly comfortable, and felt like we were so close (but not too close, from a noise perspective) to the conversation pit, breakfast rooms, etc. We'll definitely plan to stay here again when we're back in Dublin.",5,2018,10,25
216,Perfect Location,"Stayed here for three nights and felt like we picked the perfect place. Large rooms, beautiful public spaces including a lovely courtyard, and a good breakfast. The staff was super friendly and helpful and location was perfect for walking to most places of interest. Would definitely stay here again.",5,2018,10,24
216,Make time for breakfast here!,"The highlight is the breakfast. The honor bar was a nice touch as well. The service overall was very good, at times above and beyond. A tad noisy if at the back of the house, especially if people are coming back late. Overall, a very nice spot... stylish, cozy, relaxing,",4,2018,10,23
216,Ireland,"We stayed at No.31 on our visit to Dublin. An exceptional location, quiet, yet a short walk through the park to Graftin Street. Never thought such a lovely guest house would be so close to the city center yet so private. The staff was very helpful. Definitely would stay here again if ever in Dublin.",5,2018,10,07
216,Not your usual B&B,"Number 31 has won awards and has lots of good reviews so we are bucking the trend by giving it a rating of 3. We’d like to give it 3.5 really as it was more than average but not, in our opinion, very good - yet. We were given a room in the Georgian house, on the third floor. We noticed the road noise as we settled in and hoped it would die down at night. Unfortunately, it didn’t and we had a sleepless night made worse by my husband  being ill - nothing to do with Number 31. In the morning I spoke to the receptionist about the noise and asked if there was another room available away from the road. The manager turned up at this point and was very sympathetic about our lack of sleep and my husband’s illness. I was shown a couple of alternative rooms and chose one. The staff moved our luggage immediately and were extremely attentive in making sure we were OK in the new room. The manager agreed a free upgrade which was a generous gesture and excellent customer service. For customer service alone, we would give the place a 5. What let it down for us were the dark rooms and the general sense that it needs some TLC. Little things like one tiny bin in the room are simple to fix and Jenny, the brand new manager, is definitely on the case and determined to make positive changes without changing the natural quirkiness of the establishment. A spruce up, better lighting and noise reduction for the street facing rooms, or letting people know in advance that there is likely to be street noise, will easily get Number 31 to very good or better as lots is already good, like the excellent breakfasts and the customer service. We hope to be back to see Jenny’s plans fulfilled.",3,2018,09,28
216,"The best staff, good location","This was our first stop in Ireland, and since we drove there directly from the airport, we arrived early. Surprisingly, we were told that our room was ready for our two night stay. The staff was unbelievably helpful and friendly. As advertised, the breakfast was excellent, and cooked to order. Although limited, we never had a problem getting a parking space. The only potential issue (not a problem during our stay) was that our room was on the second floor in the front building. It opened directly into the dining room. I think that a guest thought that it might have been a bathroom, but, of course we kept the door locked. Breakfast started at 7:30, but we didn't hear much noise before then. Similarly, one of the walls of the room was shared by the lobby, and not very soundproof. Again, not a problem for us, but if there were any kind of commotion in the lobby, it would be clearly audible in the room. 
All in all, we really enjoyed our stay, and would stay there again.",5,2018,09,23
216,Super B&B - far better than the expensive hotels,"We were referred to this place by family, and later, we had received unsolicited referrals to it when people heard we were going to Dublin. It has a well earned rep as a great place to stay.

Number 31 is essentially two buildings, separated by a cute courtyard. The first building contains the entrance, reception area, a common area, honour bar, and the breakfast room. Some rooms are also in this building. 

The common area is a sunken living room, with a small fireplace. It’s not uncommon to find one or two people here, enjoying the fire, reading a paper, and sipping a drink from the honour bar. The breakfast room is up a level. It’s set up in family style. We’d recommend you find a spot on the enclosed terrace. It’s a wonderful little spot, where you can enjoy the outdoors without being exposed to the elements.

The second building contains most of the rooms. We were in room 20, a smaller room, but only by comparison to others in that building. We had a large entry room, containing a desk and two chairs. The bedroom was also quite big, with tall ceilings and a large window. The ensure was small, but sufficient. The furnishings and decor are a bit dated, but comfortable. 

A number of things make this place stand out. Start with breakfast - plenty of a la carte choices as part of your rate. Everything we had was first rate - freshly made, very tasty, and more than filling. The proprietor is also exceptionally friendly and helpful. Even though she was busy cooking up breakfast for many guests, she still had time to drop by, say hello, and offer suggestions for the day. The place is also a short ten minute walk to St Stephens Square, Grafton Street, and the heart of Dublin. Trinity College and Temple Bar are no more than a twenty min walk away. Finally, you will pay about half the rate of the hotels in the area. An exceptional deal given the location and service.

This will be our go to place in Dublin.

216,Highly Disappointing,"Based on all the great reviews, we were really looking forward to our stay at Number 31. We arrived early due to the early arrival of our flight and we were told we could leave our luggage until 3 when our room would be ready. We were hoping for a warmer reception, but understood that we needed to leave until our room was ready. Around 3:15, we were led up four long flights of stairs to a very dark room.  We then understood that “charming and cozy” really meant old and run-down. The bed even had a big slash in the side. We tried to log on to the WiFi only to find that it didn’t really work in our room. When we asked about it, we were told that it was down in the area - hard to believe since it worked in the hotel reception area. So, lots of standard answers for guests who question but not really what I would expect from a very highly rated and not inexpensive hotel. Number 31 did not seem like the same hotel we had read about in the reviews. Could the reviewers be seeing the same place we saw? Hard to believe. I would suggest staying somewhere else if you are looking for a really nice hotel.",2,2018,09,20
216,Comfortable excellence.,"Our stay at 31 was a total pleasure.  Loved our room and terrific welcome and helpful staff and couldn't imginee staying elsewhere. This is a boutique hotel rather than a guest house and the design is off the best - modern mixed with antiques and comfortable,comfortable!  The award winning breakfast is just that (tho prefer kippers on the bone and jugged). A high array of cereals, fruits and compotes, delicious bread and crispy viennoiserie! Plus super friendly and charming staff wiling to help with all plans, taxi advice etc.  Could hardly be bettered!!",5,2018,09,20
216,Loved it!,"Visited in April as a solo female traveler and loved it. The lounge area by reception was a great place to relax in the evenings, the room was spacious and comfortable and the staff were awesome. It was on a quiet street but still close to restaurants, sights and public transport so it was easy to get around without a car. I loved it and would return if I was visiting Dublin again!

The only issue I had was that the room key was kind of big and heavy like a paperweight, but that is minor in terms of issues really.",4,2018,09,18
216,Not much good to say,"Our 2-night reserved room was reassigned because the hotel was concerned with my wife's ""mobility"" status (knee operation).  We were reassigned, without our knowledge, to Room number 12 - a tiny room with twin beds (bedsprings with a 2"" padded cover), no thermostat or air conditioning, lights burned out in the bathroom, a toilet seat that was not attached to the bowl, and a dirty, stained bathroom counter top.  The staff and my travel agent were informed and we were promised the issues would be taken care of the following day, including the installation of a double bed.

We spent a lousy, hot and uncomfortable night and left the next morning to see the sights of Dublin.  We returned at 5 PM and found the following:

* One of three bad light bulbs was replaced.
* The twin beds were pushed together to make our 'double' bed.
* The toilet seat was still not attached.
* The counter top was still dirty.

Tomorrow we depart Dublin.  Our stay would have been wonderful had it not been for the incredibly lousy room and staff's zero response to our requests.  I will be asking (through our agent) for a refund as well.

Thanks ""Number 31"" for a truly terrible experience.",1,2018,09,16
216,Can’t Say Enough About This Wonderful Hotel !,"Well located on a quiet lane, a four minute walk from the airport bus stop. We arrived at 6:45 am and were immediately welcomed. Too early to check in but he took our bags, settled us in a lovely sunken room with a fireplace. Brought a tray with fresh coffee and invited us to enjoy the newspapers while we waited. When the day staff came around 7:00 she greeted us warmly, explained that there had been an early check out and we could get into our room as soon as it was cleaned. Meanwhile we had a fabulous breakfast, maybe the best breakfast I have had at a hotel. Room was accessed through a courtyard and, as others have mentioned, there are stairs, which I would expect in a downtown heritage building.  Good sized room, looked out onto the courtyard. Loved the heated towel rack. All the staff we encountered were friendly, helpful and efficient. 10 minute walk to St Stephen’s green, Starbucks across the lane. Price was comparable to other downtown hotels. Highly recommend.",5,2018,09,15
216,I found the company exhilarating!,"This place is so good - charming service - your hosts are relaxed , professional and knowledgeable. Our room in this grand old townhouse was full of character and thoroughly comfortable. Breakfast is incredible. Good location very close to St Stephens Green and a short walk to some great restaurants Just brilliant ....",5,2018,09,09
216,Nice but too expensive,"This hotel on itself is joke, but given the price they charge (we paid euro 364/night for a family room) this performance is not good enough.
The hotel is has a charming atmosphere but it does makes the impression it is run by good willing amateurs. Capacity of the breakfast room was not sufficient, the buffet is not filled up regularly, in the small garden there is only one table to sit at, the corridor to our room in the sous terrain was too dark. 
The hotel is close to the centre and does have a few parking places of itself",2,2018,08,29
216,Avoid staying at this over priced B&B,"We booked this B&B because on the website it looked amazing but when we arrived it was a different story. The guy that took us to our room was friendly but he failed to mention that it was on the very top floor and as my 84 year old mother was with us it was a huge struggle for her to make it. As we were going up he kept saying it's just the next flight and of course it wasn't. All and all we had to climb 97 steps from the front door to the bedroom. We only stayed the one night and as we were going down for breakfast my mother had to make sure she had everything with her to leave because she just would not be able to make it up again. The room itself was ok, it had cracks on the wall and ceilings and the noise from the traffic was awful as the windows were single glazed. The only good thing I can say is the breakfast was good. Would not stay here again.",2,2018,08,28
216,Boutique guest house in the Georgian quarter,"We stayed here for two nights on first visit to Dublin. We chose this because of the numerous favorable reviews and recommendations in many forums and guidebooks. This is a guest house made up of several converted Georgian buildings, with a courtyard in between. Most rooms need to be accessed by climbing stairs. The location is very good-ten minutes to St, Stephen's Green and 20 minutes to Grafton street. It is very quiet, which we appreciated. 
Our check-in was quick  friendly,with coffee provided, and our room was ready even though we arrived early. Unfortunately our room was in the basement of a building, down a dark flight of steps, lit by red floor lights. it looked out on  a dank pavement. This made it difficult to see the steps. It was a good size and had the basic facilities, ironing board etc on demand. There was no air-conditioning, which made it very warm at this time of year. they told us that such warm weather is unusual, and so they provide heating more than cooling. We had a fan and opening  windows helped. There was an excellent cooked breakfast, very well made. There is no restaurant , and not many nearby. 
The best point about this guest house is the very friendly and helpful staff. It is best for those looking for character and difference, perhaps a little harder for older persons like us, and not for business. Somewhat expensive for the facilities we had.",3,2018,08,24
216,A Quiet Spot in Dublin,"Located just off a main street, this unique B&B serves a crazy good cranberry bread as one of the breakfast offerings. The hotel itself is two buildings with a quaint garden connecting them. Room 15 is below street level so not a lot of natural light. However, very roomy for three adults and clean. Just an 8-10 minute walk through St. Stephen's Park to Grafton Street and almost around the corner from Doheny & Nesbitt. Thumbs up!",4,2018,08,21
216,Cute boutique hotel but highly overpriced,"For a price of 280Eur per night, you would expect not being waken up by housekeeping at 8.30 every morning. Rooms are noisy (no double glazed windows) so you can hear the road traffic from Leeson Street (for the rooms overlooking the garden). Windows do not insulate from the cold outside as on a windy day, you can feel the wind in the room as well.
When we made the comments to reception at checkout, the only reply was « sorry to hear that ». Which demonstrates little interest in the clients from the hotel managers (you would at least expect something along the lines of we are going to try to fix this...)

Otherwise the breakfast served is good. Room size is good and bathroom is OK. Location a bit remote from most tourist attractions.

Will not come back. It is a pity because the place has a lot of potential should it be more client focused.",3,2018,08,19
216,Warm welcome and AMAZING breakfast: let down by the room,"This is a hard review to write, because I spent ages selecting the perfect place to stay when visiting Dublin for a very special occasion. The highlights of our stay at Number 31 were: 1) The absolutely AMAZING breakfast whipped up by Delia. She is not only a goddess in the kitchen, but a really lovely person who gave fantastic recommendations for what to do in Dublin. She is a real treasure! 2) A very warm welcome on a very cold and wet day. It was lovely to arrive and be offered warm drinks and cake and to enjoy the fire whilst we situated ourselves. It was exactly what we were hoping for. 
The room, however, was pretty disappointing. It was tired: the carpet was worn, the soft furnishings were dirty, the walls heavily cracked. We weren't looking for luxurious, but it all felt very used. In addition, the bathroom was very dark and didn't have enough lighting to be able to slap on a face.  There was really no suitable lighting to get ready in the room.  The shower was clogged the first morning. I mean, ankle deep water. When we mentioned it to reception in the morning, the young lady wasn't surprised. The faucet on the sink was loose as well.  That was repaired and the shower must have been snaked because it wasn't as slow the next day, but ... Well, we wanted to LOVE Number 31, and we did love the breakfast and the lounge and welcome, but felt a bit crestfallen about the room, especially considering the cost. We wanted someplace with a very personal service, but when the room feels run down, it is hard for service to overcome that. 
Would I go back?  Possibly; but I would want to know that there was some refurbishment undertaken. It's a lot of commenting/review for something being rated 'Very Good' but average doesn't seem like a fair rating for the lovely Delia and her kitchen wizardry.  I hope the establishment is able to make progress with their plans for updating soon.",4,2018,08,15
216,Wonderful stay in Dublin,"Walking into Number31 dazed and dreary from an unpleasant redeye flight from PVD, Sabrina welcomed us, invited us to join for breakfast, gave us a list of early opening attractions on a Sunday, and let us have a rest and use the wifi all before being able to officially check in. While we were preparing to head out for a very sleepy walk around Dublin, our room magically became ready. We got to nap in our cozy bed, shower, and relax on our perfect little patio and refresh for our 2 days of Dublin sightseeing. The hotel is unique, tucked away yet perfectly walkable to everything in the city, has a pete fire, an honesty bar, and the most delish breakfast. Thank you to Sabrina and the entire staff for making out trip to Ireland start out perfectly. Stay Here!",5,2018,08,10
216,"Wonderful Staff , but  A  B&B  In Need of Restoration and TLC","The great staff, a  convenient location to Dublin's attractions  and  beautiful original structure help  override some the obvious modern shortcomings of this B& B.   The hotel is in need of fresh paint, restored plantings and air conditioning, hardly something Ireland has had to worry about in the past.  Included  in room rate are some of the best breakfasts, beautifully prepared and  delicious  under the expert  care of Delia Behan, a true gem.  .    ",3,2018,08,01
216,Pros and Cons,"Staff were good and best part were the breakfasts where you have a wide selection of items.  Food was very good and promptly served.  There's a small bar near the reception area called the Honest Bar where you serve yourself and note what you took.  Some nights it was open late and other days closed.

Reviews suggested requesting an upper floor room which we did, however, we didn't realize we had to walk up 63 stairs every time we wanted to get to our room on the third floor.  After days of hiking and lots of walking, that wasn't real pleasant.  

While the room was ok for sleeping with some outside noise, even though we had the window closed, it was very dark which made it hard to find things in our luggage and the outlets were near the floor. Also the halls were dark and laundry stacked everywhere.

Not a place we would recommend.",3,2018,08,01
216,Not what we expected for the price we paid!,"Our travel agent book us at this guest house. The staff that work here are excellent !  The suite we had , not so great. We were situated below street level. At the the time it was very hot in Dublin and the window was open. My fear was a stray animal or person entering our room.    I was assured that would not happen. I was not very confidant , we accepted the room,",2,2018,07,28
216,Do not book here.,"This hotel is not as advertised on the Internet or as was recommended by many others on travel advisor when I looked into booking over eight months ago.  It is not bright and luxurious but dark, musty, and feels dirty.  The room is wall to wall carry brown and the bathroom the same.  The furniture cushioning was all worn out and wrapped in scratchy linen muslin like cloth (picture attached).  My mattress had a rip in it.  The sheets were not 100% Egyptian Cotten or anything like it.  The sheets also had pen marks or other blemishes.  The bathroom tile wall was ripping apart (picture attached).  The ceiling above where they had my daughter’s twin bed had in fact cracked open and had a large water mark running along the ceiling by it (picture attached).  I thought it could open any moment and crash into the room.  To get to the “family room” you have to go up and down and up and down these sets of stairs, the last being a very dark stairwell that had uneven risers the last being two inches and a huge tripping hazard (picture also attached one taken with flash).   

We toughed it out here three nights, as one of my children was not feeling well and it is hard to move five people and luggage.

The others negative reviews of this hotel are right on too—one tiny trash can in the bathroom rolling luggage above the room all morning long.  

The manager said the B & B understands it needs to refurbish the room, and that there were repairs that needed to be made before we checked in but because it is the only “family” room they did not want to let us know ahead of time.  I really wish they had warned us and given us he opportunity to go elsewhere before our arrival.  The manager comped one of three nights, but eew, it was still over priced and do not stay in this hotel.  At least room number 15 is not acceptable, and my friend who was in another room did not like it either.

If they refurbished all the rooms and got folks to help with the luggage on all the stairs, the lobby and breakfast areas are more acceptable and in line with what is advertised on the website.  But until then, do not come here.",1,2018,07,23
216,Don’t do it - book somewhere else!,"We had booked this hotel six months in advance and as this hotel was so expensive we’re expecting to enjoy a reasonable stay.  We were given rooms in the basement which were noticeably hotter than the rest of the hotel.  We were also subject to the noise of people walking to and fro on the corridors above - not restful.  The shower rooms are tiny (there are no baths at the property), dark and barely functional.  The hotel is in a fairly poor state of repair with plug sockets hanging off the wall and a number of repairs are obviously required.  We were very disappointed and would not recommend this hotel to anybody.  For the outrageous price they charge you can certainly find better in Dublin.",1,2018,07,22
216,Not exactly what we expected,"We opted to stay at Number 31 because of previous reviews (and accolades given by Lonely Planet and Rick Steves). After arriving, I regretted that I had no done more research regarding where to stay in Dublin since this property is so run down and quirky it's a 120 Euro stay - not a 250 one and I am certain we could have found better accommodations with some effort.  Two positives -- the people were nice and the breakfast was good. Negatives include:  The room at the very top (no lift) and a climb up 6-8 flights of stairs to reach our fourth floor room was a pain. When we checked in, we soon discovered a broken toilet and had to call for help immediately. On top of that, plumbing is highly questionable with a vague sewer smell in the bath the whole time we were there. One outlet the room meant electric kettle needed to be placed on carpeted floor to use it. Blinds we broken...I mean, where does it end?!  The lighting was horrible and the ancient bed was not comfortable or luxurious as we would expect in a boutique guest house. If this was a budget place, it could work, but this is not the 4-star property advertised our promoted by other industry reviewers.",2,2018,07,21
216,Big big disappointment,"We stayed at Number31 for 3 nights last week.
I was very excited to stay at this beautifully advertised boutique B&B. 
How we were wrong at expectations. 
First of all, the room we were given was the room (45) next to the breakfast room in the mew. Wow, just next to the breakfast room, what privacy is expected? 
On top of this it was quite warm in Dublin and there was no airconditioning, the room felt like a sauna. The only facility provided were two rotating fans. For 260 EUROs per night, we would expect air conditioning facilities. The bathroom smelled horrible ( moldy) and the shower was broken as well.
We complained and were given a basement room (17) in the Gregorian house, at the opposite of the mew house. This room is much cooler as it was in the  basement, so at least we could have some good night sleep. 
The connecting garden with its stairs and bricks was not ideal for moving heavy luggages. Besides there are no lifts in this whole facility, so they should have warn their visitors. My partner was already very annoyed by this time. As he needed to carry this.
One of the reasons of staying at Number31 was because of the fact they have Hastens beds in all of their rooms. I've wanted to test this before purchasing one for ourselves. Indeed it was a Hastens bed, but from centuries ago. I wonder if they have cleaned those beds regularly, as it was all stained. We also found hairs between the upper mattress and the boxspring. ( yikes, but did not think too much of it, otherwise we would have made a big fight)
The area above room 17 is the corridor to other rooms, housekeeping staff were moving around in the morning. So be aware that you can't sleep in. 
One positive note is the breakfast, it is freshly made every morning. However, the staff could be more friendly and greet the guests more genuine or smile. 
We had the feeling that we had to greet them first. I mean, if you don't like to be social or feel grumpy all the time, why work in the hospitality business? This is something I always question myself. There are tons of other professions, work elsewhere!
They really can learn from most Asian countries, where hospitality is top notch. 

Next, the housekeeping staff have put the glasses of my partner between the sheets on the first day cleaning. He had put this on the side table.
His glasses are now a bit crooked. But he will let the opticien fix this. 
All with all, would we ever recommend this to anyone? Well, to an enemy perhaps. 
We paid 800 EUROS for 3 nights at this 'MEDIOCRE B&B' - I am sure you can find better hotels in Dublin.",1,2018,07,16
216,Good location ,"We stayed here for one night.  It was a nice guesthouse in a superb location.  Breakfast was delicious and plentiful.  The staff was kind and helpful.  The only downside was the room, which was small, stuffy and felt like more of a dorm as far a furniture and comfort.  We were on the top floor of the Georgian house and were just expecting a bit more charm, especially given the price.",4,2018,07,16
216,A Horrible Experience,"We’d reserved the family room at Number 31 for the steep price of 400 Euro per night.  We were optimistic that it would be a cool and charming place to stay in the heart of Georgian Dublin.  We’re no strangers to Dublin, nor are we strangers to varying levels of luxury, from the lowest budget hotels to the height of decadence.  This price wasn’t the highest we ever paid, but for that amount of expense, we had certain expectations.  From the start, we saw the signs that this wasn’t what we signed up for.

The parking lot is tight (and not free either, despite what is advertised on TripAdvisor), and requires the blocking in of other guest’s cars, as well as the handing over of your keys so they can move your car if someone needs to get out. I decided not to fret about the potential liability issues with such an arrangement should they damage my rental car.  Nor did I stress out that the lighting on our way down the steps to our room was so dim, the carpet so dark, and the last half-step so treacherous, that it would be easy to fall or twist an ankle.  We were on vacation and I wasn’t going to let trivial things like potential thousands of dollars of liability or serious injury ruin it.

Then we were shown our room.  We really tried to find the charm in the serious water damage (and very likely mold) in no less than 3 different parts of the ceiling.  We tried to enjoy the quaint urban view of a concrete alcove housing a metal mouse trap.  We tried to laugh off the fact that the solitary garbage can in the room was a tiny bin in the bathroom.  We even tried to laugh about how worn the furniture appeared, from the warped metal lightshade to the dilapidated chairs dotting the room.  The lighting was so poor we joked about us being vampires, and the lighting in the bathroom reminded us of the spotlights in a bad jazz lounge.  But at the end of the day we’re adults and we’re past the age of make believe…

The “luxurious” beds they highlight on their web site were a step up from a jail-bed, topped with a strange assembly of sheets somehow involving a cotton towel (the hotel isn’t wrong when they refer to the “stunning” bedding – but I suspect they meant something different).  As our pictures show, one of the “mattresses” was punctured and looked to have endured a nasty encounter with moisture of some kind.  Back to the bathroom, the plumbing seems especially sound, as multiple events caused water to drip from the rain shower head, such as flushing the toilet or bumping the sink, which was not solidly anchored to the wall.  Even with all the lights on, my shower brought to mind what it must be like to shower in prison, minus the fear of being shanked.

In the end, we couldn’t do it.  We complained and got the absent “manager” to agree to refund our second night so we could stay elsewhere.  We ended up at a fine hotel, at a savings of over 250 Euro.  And now we can tell stories of our interesting night spent in Kilmainham Gaol… I mean Number 31 Dublin.",1,2018,07,13
216,Quirky hotel,"I booked this very last minute (an hour before I needed to check in). My room was lovely, large and comfortable although there was only a fan as apparently hotel has no air conditioning. I didn’t find this an issue though even though it was hot outside it wasn’t unbearable inside. Bed was really comfortable, bathroom large and the staff very welcoming, helpful and informative. It was great to have parking in such a central location. Unfortunately I had to leave about 15 minutes before the official breakfast time so I didn’t get an opportunity to try the food which seems to have such wonderful reviews. The gentleman on reception made me fresh coffee which was much appreciated. My rating would have been a 5 if if wasn’t for the rather odd attitude over breakfast though when I asked another member of staff  if I could take something with me & was offered some processed prepacked muffin & cereal bar even though I could see there was fresh homemade bread ready and waiting to be be served. I’m sure that could have spared a couple of slices as after all the rate I paid  was for bed and breakfast.

216,Gregorian B & B,Selected because of the outstanding reviews but regret the choice.  Expect a very pleasant staff and a good chef (although butter is too liberally used for my taste).  This is an architecturally interesting dwelling that lacks comfort.  The place is a converted Georgian house linked by a garden to a mid-century home with a sunken living room as a common area & what feels like a pedestal reception (due to the 3 steps above).   You'll encounter steps galore throughout most of which were constructed prior to step regulations.  Fans are provided as there is no air condition.    Over-priced,2,2018,07,08
216,Lovely Boutique Hotel ,"Number 31 is lovely boutique hotel located near St Stephens Green. It is divided between a classic Georgian townhouse and an updated mews house. Nicely separated via private courtyard. The rooms are quaint, comfortable and clean. The top of the line breakfast is served fresh on the mews house. A great place to stay as it is walkable to several good restaurants and attractions.",5,2018,07,05
216,Stay at Number 31,"After reading the outstanding reviews of Number 31, we were eager to visit. Unfortunately, our experience did not match our expectations. The room was way over priced for what we got in return. The lighting was awful in both the bedroom and bathroom. The bathroom was so tiny, it was difficult to turn around in it. There was no control for temperature so we were either too cold or too warm. The shelf in the shower broke and wasn’t fixed. There was no Kleenex in the bathroom The housekeeper did not dispose of the trash in the trash in and the bathroom floors were dirty. The bed linen was stained. Some may think that these issues are petty but we paid $300/night. I would never recommend this property.",2,2018,06,23
216,Number 31,"First time visitor to Dublin. I always prefer the boutique hotels to the large chains and this hotel exceeded my standards. Clean, quiet, and sumptuous rooms. It is in the business district, but extremely quiet when you are in the hotel and your room. Highly recommend.",5,2018,06,22
216,"Great location, wonderful breakfast","This hotel is quirky but in a lovely way.  The reception area is lovely with a sunken seating area and fire.  There are no evening meals but the breakfast is out of this world! The hotel is within walking distance of St Stephen's Square anyway so that is not an issue.  The staff are friendly and helpful and I would recommend it to others.  The only criticism I would level is that, in some places in the main house, the decor is a little tired and could do with updating.",4,2018,06,17
216,Perfect Location to Explore Dublin,"Behind the front gate door is a sanctuary of peace and tranquility. The location could not be any better as our bus stop from the airport is less than a block away and well within walking distance to all the attractions that Dublin has to offer. The fresh fruit enhanced water in the common room told us that we had picked the right place. The staff at the desk was more that willing to suggest places to visit and restaurants to eat at. The adjacent park was lovely on this Spring day to walk around and see all the people taking in the weather. The garden room had a very comfortable bed and nice shower. Often Europe is known for small baths but this one had a huge shower. We had to leave early for the airport but the staff was more than willing to get us coffee and pastries but we regretfully declined. The only suggestion that we have is to make more lighting in the stairwell as one of us twisted our ankle when going down it. The ambiance is lovely but more lighting maybe necessary. Other than that, we had a most wonderful time and can’t wait to return. Thank you so much for your hospitality!",4,2018,06,06
216,A pleasant stay,We enjoyed our stay.  Shannon was a dolly so very helpful. They made us a to go breakfast when we had to catch the plane so early in the morning.  Her Mums porridge is delicious.  All the staff is very accommodating.  Some of the rooms are really made for the family.  ,5,2018,06,04
216,Great location and great staff,"This hotel is in a great location and has wonderfully hospitable and helpful staff. 
The lobby area is modern and trendy.  The rooms are in an older building which is a bit shabby but the location and staff over-ride the minor issues with the rooms. 
The bed was very comfortable but the bathroom we had was tiny.",4,2018,06,02
216,Such a delight! ,Lovely hotel that is half boutique and half bed and breakfast with fantastic style and design. It really added to our stay instead of a chain hotel. The breakfast is a lovely experience and it feels like a sanctuary so close to the centre. Location is fantastic. ,5,2018,05,21
216,"Pleasant, friendly B&B","Outstanding B&B. Friendly, staff (especially aoghman(sp)) A super location. Top quality and service - super B'Fast. Easy walk to all the sites. Beer, wine, drinks available always available via honor system; I liked that. Rooms are good size, clean and relaxing. This is well worth the expense.",5,2018,05,20
216,"Interesting quirky place with outstanding service and location, but only for the fit and able","Number 31 is in a perfect location, a few minutes' walk from major sites and lovely parks. Its service is absolutely first class. Breakfasts are good. Unfortunately the design (by a well-known Dublin modern architect of the 1970s, apparently ) is quirky to the point of impossible. Our room was immensely dark and we had to crawl on the ground to find a power point. A beautiful Georgian room had been vandalised to create a dark, dark shower room - and we water had come through the ceiling in the past. Eco - forget it, the staff are told to keep lights on in the hall  even when sunlight is pouring through the fanlight. The main and more modern part of the house is lovely and light and white but full of endless steps without banisters, and the rooms have incredibly low ceilings and no external windows.  To get your excellent breakfast ( lots of fresh fruit, compotes, soda bread,croissants, home-made looking jams and super cooked dishes like kippers with poached eggs or scrambled with smoked salmon), you have to climb a ladder-like staircase and sit at a noisy crowded shared table right under the roof. So don't go if you are elderly or in the slightest bit disabled -- but if you do go, both the manager and the reception staff are exceptionally helpful and will do absolutley anyhting to help.",3,2018,05,15
216,A real pleasure,"Spent one night there - first night in Ireland. We were a party of four. Service wonderful, staff delightful, gave us a great recommendation for dinner. Super breakfast and nice room. What more could you ask for.",5,2018,05,14
216,"Excellent service, but...","I completely agree with the previous review (chic, but lacking...).  The breakfast was amazing, and almost makes up for the room which was in need of updating, cleaning, and maintenance.  It almost felt like a dorm room.  We also had no hot water, and had to sleep with the window open. The lobby and breakfast area was very nice, very chic.  The staff could not have been more helpful or accommodating.  If they updated the rooms this would be a five star experience.",3,2018,05,04
216,Chic but lacking certain creature comforts,"Location and architectural features are the assets of this guest house— a few blocks from St Stephen's Green; a charming garden and breakfast area; a chic, modernist lounge. The staff is very friendly, and the breakfasts bountiful and delicious. However, and unfortunately, certain creature comforts were lacking in our four days there. Our room was spacious but so poorly lit I came to feel I was returning to a cave. The shower delivered not hot but tepid water and even that was insufficient: we are conservative with our water use but we had to race through our morning showers. The pillows were plentiful but with the substance of handkerchiefs. There was a heated towel rack in the bathroom which was turned off but nevertheless leaked, and it was fixed only after two requests and two days. The worst thing was being awakened at 6am on our second day by what sounded like furniture being dragged across the floor above us. When I complained the staff person apologized and explained that it was the Monday morning laundry being hauled off . . . I guess this happens regularly and woe to the sleeper downstairs. Given the cost and these problems, and despite the advantages I stated above, I would not stay here on my next trip to Dublin.",3,2018,05,02
216,Pros & Cons,"Pros;
Location is very good.
Decor is euro chic..super cute.
Staff welcomed us very professional.
Room is nice.
Shower is nice rain head type.

Cons;
Very hot at night with no airflow:
We tried calling front desk at midnight but no one answered and we could literally hear the phone ringing from our room
( they said someone would be at front 24/7 if needed - glad we only were calling to ask for a fan and it wasn’t an emergency).

The bathroom has this glowing wall which is cute but we had to keep the bathroom door closed just to block the light it is way too bright.

The sunken den/common area has acoustics of an amphitheater..
Some men were there talking LOUDLY and laughing from about 12:15-1:15a.m. & we could literally hear every single word..
It was so loud !😡 (Rude people completely I considerate of others trying to sleep.)

Our room was in a horrible location right beside breakfast area which was loud and made it impossible to sleep in late.

This place has many cool features but I honestly would prefer to have stayed somewhere that was more comfortable and not so loud!!!",3,2018,04,24
216,Exceptional Welcome,"Strongly recommend this place for a stay in Dublin. It is very central, within easy walking distance of the city centre. We were made very welcome on arrival with tea and homemade cake beside a turf fire. Our room in the Georgian house was large with spectacular Georgian features, a well appointed bathroom and very comfortable beds.
Our host Eamon was happy to make suggestions for local dining options and the honesty bar was well stocked with a wide variety of gins accompanied by notes on the best way to serve each type.
Delia's renowned breakfast did not disappoint, well deserving the reputation it has acquired.
All the staff made us feel very much at home and were happy to help with any request.",5,2018,04,17
216,Birthday trip,"We stayed with 2 other couples for a celebration of  birthdays . Booking and reception staff are charming and very helpful . We stayed in rooms 10, 11 and 12 which were in the coach house area beside the  sitting room and close to the  front door . Room 10 should not be used as a bedroom - it leaked badly after a rainstorm through a 1970s style front window which separated the room from an outside seating area which was used to 1.30 am by a couple smoking , only a pane of glass separated our companions from this  intrusion  and the hotel subsequently moved them to the main house to a very nice room , however they should not have been put into room 10 in the first palce . We could all hear door bell noise  and we all felt that the housekeeping wasnt great   - cobwebs etc .   .
 Number 31 is a really nice place with charming hosts and fabulous breakfasts in an area of outstanding architecture and  easy acess to shops and museums, but-- and its a big but  - standards need to be maintained more professionally  than at present . its a shame as it could be top notch , Owners can't  just blame the buildings -they need to sort out the problems or not let the rooms which don't come up to standard until they are fixed  .",3,2018,04,11
216,Again and again and again,"I adore this little place. The first time I stayed was with work and ever since then I try to stay anytime I am in Dublin. There is always a warm and friendly welcome. This personal approach is most evident  over breakfast in the conservatory at the long shared table. Its worth staying just for this! The rooms are quirky, without trying to be, its just the nature of the buildings with a contemporary space on the breakfast side of the courtyard and the period rooms in the house. But what really sells this as the only place to stay are the people behind it. Their warmth runs through the business. If you prefer a corporate, slightly souless experience its not going to be for you but if personality, character and service are the thing, well, then I couldn't recommend it enough",5,2018,04,03
216,PROS & CONS,"PROS
1. The location is just brilliant, close to everything.
2. The staff is very friendly and professional.
3. The breakfast (the star of the place), is constructively too much and too delicious.
4. The rooms are all different and creative.
5. The ""living room"" with a fireplace is super warm and friendly.

CONS
1. The TV's are too small.

216,A brilliant find in Dublin,"Great location, reasonably priced and feels a bit special. The decor isn’t perfect but it’s still v cool and the rooms are lovely. The staff couldn’t be nicer and more helpful and the breakfast was all freshly cooked and amazing. Can’t recommend highly enough - I’ll definitely return next time I’m in Dublin. ",5,2018,03,29
216,overnight stay,"We stayed at 31 last week We enjoyed our stay very much We were met by the manager Eamon who made us very welcome.  We had a lovely room a great nights sleep and a super breakfast cooked by the chef Delia,  The staff were very friendly 
31 has a very relaxing place to stay 
We would definitely stay again",5,2018,03,26
216,Far more than a B&B,"I wanted to call this review Hipsters Heaven but thought that might actually put some people off. From the moment I arrived I was intrigued to find out what this hotel was like. The approach is a side road off Lesson Street and although its just a wooden door in a brick wall somehow it's very appealing, once inside it just gets better - the front entrance just had a soft appeal and makes this establishment look far beyond it's star status.

The staff are all really welcoming and I felt right at home almost immediately. The lounge (photo on their website) is a big u shaped sunken sofa, designed to engage guests that are unknown to each other to talk (you don't have too though). The bar is run on an honesty basis - just help yourself and record it on the charge sheet - brave but it must work and why not.

My room (no.12) was well appointed and very comfortable - I particularly like the french door access to a small secluded and enclosed garden with chairs.

Breakfast is upstairs from reception and again organised as large tables for everyone to sit at but still offer space if your feeling quite - nice conservatory area to the back as well - probably the best spot in the early summer mornings. Breakfast itself was excellent - simple menu but all freshly cooked - not hot buffet here. Eggs Benedict first morning, cooked to perfection and a mushroom frittata the second - both recommended.

So why the Hipster Heaven reference? I'm far to old to be a hipster but this place just exudes youthful charm with a trendy twist - most of the guest whilst I was there were definitely in the trend setter category but a delight to chat to.

I'd have no hesitation in staying here again - describes itself as a B&B Guesthouse but it's far more than that, just doesn't offer lunch or dinner but with its location there's no shortage of choice within a few minutes walk.",5,2018,03,24
216,Nightmare on noisy street..,"This hotel could make a great setting for a horror movie...
From the unwelcoming door with its hidden bell to the shockingly bad service and tired decor, the setting would be perfect.
But the worst thing is the noise. I had the most disturbed night in a hotel that I have ever had last night...
First of all I was disturbed by a group message in the bar area and despite 3 calls to the reception it was almost an hour before it died down. 
Then after another 40 minutes or so the dreadful doorbell started ringing - as nobody answered it the same people started calling the hotel phone and knocking - all of this noise was so loud it sounded as though it was in my room. And this was around 12.30am. When nobody from the hotel still came I decided to do the decent thing and got out of bed in my pyjamas and opened the front door myself!
After this commotion died down I hoped to finally get some sleep- that was when I discovered the dripping tap noises...  when it gets as bad as this you start to notice all sorts of things- like how dirty the room is and how old the bathroom is.
The only positive (making 2 stars) is the breakfast...
But the nightmare experience is not one that I would want anyone else to go through...",2,2018,03,23
216,Excellent Boutique in great Dublin location,"This gem is within walking distance to everything Dublin! Our hosts were fantastic - Linda helped us navigate everything from seeing Trinity to eating at wonderful, hip places! A perfect, funky place to stay, and the breakfasts are phenomenal.",5,2018,03,18
216,Cosy stay with EXCELLENT breakfast,"Romantic small hotel with good location. Nicely decorated and clean rooms. Very helpful staff. Rooms in the Georgian house were a bit noisy, from the street as well as guests upstairs. The breakfast is excellent. Homemade bread, yoghurt, fresh fruit and berries and a cooked breakfast made as you order. Would recommend this hotel to anyone visiting Dublin.",4,2018,03,17
216,The best place in Dublin!,On secretplaces.com we found this beautiful place. We went here with the whole family and had the best time. During storm Emma the city was a mess but the staff of number 31 did everything to make the most of it. Thank you sooo much! ,5,2018,03,04
216,Excellent stay,We were in Dublin for 3 nights - loved number 31 - all the staff were very friendly and attentive. The breakfasts are outstanding. We were in the Georgian part which was very clean if a little worn. It is located a short (5 mins) walk from St Stephens Green which makes it very easy to get around Dublin. We will definitely stay here again. ,5,2018,02,22
216,Great stay,"Stayed here for a spontaneous overnighter in Dublin. Spotlessly clean, value for money and superb breakfast. The only issue, (and I’m being really picky here) was the central heating in the room was really hot. Even with windows open it was still quite hot. That aside it was a great little find in a nice quiet part of the city close to St. Stephen’s Green & Grafton Street and some really good eateries. And if you’re a coffee fan there’s a Starbucks a few paces from the front door of the premise. Would definitely recommend this little gem to anyone heading to Dublin. ",5,2018,02,18
216,Best guest house/b&b in Dublin,Number 31 is a boutique guest house style hotel off Dublin's Leeson Street - a short walk thought the scenic St. Stephens Green to the main fashionable shoping Street of Grafton St. It has modern rooms in the architect designed 'annexe' and larger rooms in the Georgian part accross the court yard. I also serves one of the best breakfasts in Dublin.,5,2018,02,12
216,Birthday Weekend,"Pleasant staff, tired shabby chic hotel.
Looks great on website but in reality needs some tlc & sprucing up.
Consists of a variety of rooms on a number of floors in the old Georgian townhouse along a modernised coach House with reception, lounge, breakfast room & a few rooms. There is a pleasant courtyard garden that you walk from the old to the new.
The room we were shown to, appeared satisfactory at first, however, tv cables sellotaped to the wall, salt stains on the curtains and missing light bulbs - all contributed to me asking for a room in the townhouse. There was no issue with this request and we were promptly shown a couple of rooms that were fine. 
Breakfast on the first morning was ok but much better on the second. 
Overall ok but could have been better - a tidy & freshen up, a little more attention to detail & a little treat or two (eg chocolates or home made biscuits) would up the quality of the offer.",3,2018,02,02
216,Hidden gem,"From the moment we arrived at no.31, we were greeted with such warmth and hospitality from Eamon who took our bags and gave us a history of the building. I cannot recommend this accommodation enough. The rooms were really big and the breakfast is fantastic. We will definitively be back. Thanks for a great stay ",5,2018,01,30
216,Perfect stay at Number 31,"Our stay at Number 31 was perfect. When we arrived Eamonn greeted us with a smile and a friendly welcome, carrying our luggage and giving us a tour. Our room was luxurious with a beautiful ensuite and the comfiest beds we’d ever slept on. The staff gave us plenty of recommendations on the best things to do in Dublin. Delia’s breakfast was delicious and there was a wide variety to choose from. Upon checkout, Eamonn offered to take us on a tour of the Georgian part of the hotel which was as beautiful as the modern part we stayed in. He went above and beyond to make us feel comfortable which we really appreciated. Without a doubt we would stay here again if travelling to Dublin and will be recommending Eamonn and his beautiful hotel to all.",5,2018,01,25
216,Great Staff and Service,"I stayed here with my Mom in January 2018 and it was perfect for our quick stay in Dublin. Nice room and amenities and great breakfast, though I couldn't enjoy too much of the food due to stomach problems. However the receptionist was so nice about letting me check out late and even brought me herbal tea. Stellar service, and great location. Only downside was we were on the ground floor so could hear car alarms. Our last night, and alarm started at 10 pm and went through the night.",5,2018,01,23
216,Cozy and warm stay that feels like home,"We stayed here in the Georgian section of the house during December 2017. Overall, our room was large by any standards, feeling more like a suite than a regular room. Bathroom and amenities were all spotless and lovely. But what really stole the show was Deliah's breakfasts. Wow. The Irish know what to do with breakfast and brunch! And the incredibly warm and personal attention from the eponymous chef was also welcome and sustained us throughout the day. With one of D's breakfasts under the belt, you can skip lunch. 

Location was also spot-on. Close enough to all the important bits but not in a noisy neighborhood like Temple Bar that will keep you from enjoying a well-earned rest. Super close to some great coffee shops and pubs as well.

We can't wait to return! See you all soon!",5,2018,01,03
216,"Modern, artsy and quaint","I stayed in Number 31 with my boyfriend and mother for 3 nights. The breakfasts are great and the dining room with the fire is amazing after a long winter's day in Dublin. It is situated within walking distance of most tourist attractions. The only problem is the stairs. We stayed on the fourth floor and it was unpleasant and uncomfortable carrying our bags and walking up the stairs. It made the stay uncomfortable for my mother. The staff are friendly and really helpful. The rooms have everything that one could need, however the showers are uncomfortably small in some rooms. The rooms were always clean. ",4,2018,01,01
216,Miss the old owners... But still excellent,"I have stayed here many times and in my opinion it is a better experience than most of the 5 star hotels in Dublin and I have stayed in most. This was largely due to the exceptional  hospitality of Noel, linda and their staff. I was always welcomed like a prodigal daughter and I loved the banter at breakfast. But sadly they are no longer there as it appears it has been sold on.

Having said that it is as good as ever with a few lovely improvements. The lounge sofas look like they have been upholstered, there is an honesty bar and tea and coffee facilities in the bedroom. The breakfasts are still outstanding but I do not like the blue plastic bowls for fruit and please put a few more tea leaves in the pot.  Staff are all lovely but it was so quiet at breakfast. I simply missed the craic and banter of previous visits. This is still the best place to stay in Dublin!

216,Change of ownership recently. Avoid. Lots of problems. ,"My wife has stayed in this property previously and loved everything about her stay so we stayed there this week on a trip to Dublin. We were given a superior room on check in across the garden in the older house. It was the most awful stay I’ve ever had would make me avoid guesthouses in future. It was like sleeping outside. The room was freezing cold. We called reception but nothing was done. We were told there has been a change in ownership recently and they have lots of problems with the house. The breakfast was fine, nothing special. We checked out and left our car there while we went out. Upon return there was nobody there to collect our keys for the car or to let us into the house. We nearly missed our flight. When I told staff how awful the nights sleep was I was told to let them know when we are coming again and they will ‘look after us’ - no thank you. ",1,2017,11,30
216,Great location and breakfast,"The staff running this small boutique hotel are welcoming and super professional. Our room was very quiet and large, especially for Dublin. But it's the breakfast that made it memorable. Poached pears with vanilla bean, fruit salad, homemade bread, best coffee, with lots of hot breakfast options cooked to order. Lovely table settings, and a space conducive to warm conversations with other guests. We met interesting travelers from Australia, New Zealand, and Europe during our 4 nights there. Dublin is a lively city with plenty to see and do. I'd recommend a week there for overseas visitors like us. This was our final stop in a 6 week trip, and we appreciated the elegant warmth and convenience of this lovely B&B.",5,2017,11,12
216,short stay but sweet,"I only had one night here, a little gem of a place behind an ivy covered door.  Short walk to St Stephens, shopping and Trinity College.  The breakfast there was delicious . Staff helpful with suggestions for how to spend the day.
Very Modern room.  Would stay again!",4,2017,11,12
216,not as described on the website,"I stayed at this hotel a couple of years ago and had a lovely room which wasn't in the main house so I returned but was very unhappy with the room I was allocated on this occasion.The website described high ceilings, fireplace, cornicing etc so I was shocked to be shown to a dark, gloomy, stuffy room which smelled unpleasant. It reminded me of a larger version of a uni student room (I've seen quite a few of those over the last few years) with extension leads trailing around and very little lighting. Ladies it's not easy to put make up on with the lighting and there is no plug anywhere near a mirror so drying your hair is also tricky.

The 'luxury beds' may have been so when they were bought, (I suspect quite some time ago) but now they are stained, shabby and rather uncomfortable. The shower tray is chipped in several places and there is no heating in the bathroom.

To be fair, when I pointed this out they did eventually offer to charge me for one category down but this was still 240 euros, which was far more than the room is worth. In fact had I known what I was getting I most definitely would not have booked at all so I still feel rather diddled and wish I had booked elsewhere. 

However the breakfast was very nice and the staff were charming although rather dippy.",2,2017,10,31
216,"Wonderful, Lovely B&B","My wife and I stayed at Number 31 for a couple of days while we explored Dublin and loved it. It's not exactly for everyone. You might say it's a bit shabby-chic, with some of the appointments being a little run-down, but the styling is quite aesthetically pleasing, the garden is lovely, everything works perfectly and the people were welcoming, helpful, attentive, gracious and kind. 
We arrived at 5:00 in the morning, having flown overnight and with Aer Lingus having lost my wife's bag, and we were welcomed generously with their wonderful breakfast and a room to recuperate in at an hour when most places wouldn't have known what to do with us. And that breakfast was a joy each morning we were there. Delightful!",5,2017,10,26
216,Great B&B,"Located in a nice section of Dublin and within walking distance of some really great restaurants, laundry service, and drug stores. This was very convenient since we didn't have a car. The owners and staff are friendly and welcoming and our room was nice but dark. They need better lighting in the room and bathroom. Breakfasts are amazing! I highly recommend the eggs benedict and smoked salmon. For dinner, I recommend Matt the Thresher located a couple of blocks away and Suesey Street bistro located just across the street. Both are excellent! If I go to Dublin again, I would definitely try and stay here.",4,2017,10,24
216,Fantastic Guesthouse in Dublin,"This is an excellent bed & breakfast situated close to St Stephen's Green and walking distance from all the major attractions on the south side of Dublin. The location was a quiet retreat from the busy section of town. The owner, Noel, and all of his staff couldn't have been more welcoming or accommodating. Ask about Justin for limo service to and from the airport. Number 31 is in a friendly Georgian House with is spacious rooms, comfortable beds and serving the most amazing selections for a delicious breakfast. There is also a nice sitting area with books, a fire place and a lovely garden between carriage house and Georgian house. We had a delightful seven days. We stayed seven days and our only complaint is the night attendant was a bit noisy and we where awakened several times during one night; our room was behind the kitchen & office area. However, the next time we visit Dublin this is where we want to stay.

216,"My wife Mary,My doughtier Maygen and myself we stayed At number 31 in July 2017",In our opinion the best place to stay in Dublin.Rooms clean and spacious .Breakfast amazing never had anything so good in my life.But most of all the hospitality of the owner.It was like to be with family and maybe even better than family.The lady chef makes the best soda bread in Ireland.so nice so gracious.We are already planning another trip for next July and we are going back for sure.I recommend Number 31 is not a hotel or Bed and Breakfast is home away from home.we will never forget.They deserve to be number 1.,5,2017,09,28
216,"""Aren't we lucky?"" said by everyone at breakfast","Number 31 is the perfect balance. Not a tiny creepy B&B or a large sterile hotel, not in the noisy Temple Bar, or far from City Center. Just delightful in every way. 
Very accommodating even though I had a midnight arrival. While at first I couldn't figure out how to open the window I had an email response awaiting me when I woke up with an explanation and promise to come by if necessary. I was pleased before I even experienced the award winning breakfast or hosts both of which live up to the reputation.
I would be sad if I ever came back to Dublin and had to stay anywhere else.",5,2017,09,23
216,A Very Enjoyable Three Days,"My hisband and I spent three lovely nights here on our too brief stay in Dublin. I highly recommend it for a number of reasons. On a practical level, 31 is very close to Dublin's major attractions yet located in a lovely block of Georgian townhouses in a quiet area close to some lovely restaurants and amenities like a wash and fold launderette. You can easily walk to major attractions likeTrinly College, St. Stephen's Green and the Post Office  yet enjoy a neighborhood vibe.  Secondly, the hosts and staff are very kind and amiable -- and serve a spanking good breakfast to boot.  Finally, the decor is a hoot. The reception and breakfast areas are in a Mews house gone Mad Men (you have to see it) while our rooms were across a lovely garden in a more traditional Georgian Town House. We would be very disappointed if we could stay here when we return to Dublin.",5,2017,09,22
216,"Wonderful home away from home in Dublin, Irelland","Noel is a treasure trove of information and an unbeatable host while you have a great vacation in the heart of Dublin. We loved our room (number 16) which we booked less than two weeks before our trip. It is a bit cramped, but just fine if you need it primarily for resting, sleeping, etc. The breakfast is fabulous (smoked salmon and scramble eggs for me.) We met interesting guests at the communal table.

WiFi is excellent, the setting is urban but beautiful, and the common areas are elegant and well furnished. There's little I would ask for, except a bit more space; but this room was booked at the last minute, and the hotel is completely full.

Two interesting rescue cats on site, if you love cats as I do",5,2017,09,14
216,Georgian,"We stayed 3 nights with Number 31. I chose the hotel due to the history, location & great reviews. The place is located next to the Starbucks. Entry is through a small single door just down from the street front. They will buzz you in. Once in you pass through a small courtyard & into the main building. The common area had a 1970's vibe with the sunken living room, fireplace, tattered black leather sectional & disco ballish bar being used as a small check in desk. The breakfast room was just up the stairs & served an included home made to order breakfast. Several great choices so hard to decide. Our last day I ordered the oatmeal. Believe me when I tell you this was the best oatmeal we have ever eaten. So simple yet incredibly creamy & flavorful especially with the local honey drizzled on top. Our room number 20 in the Georgian house was behind the main house through another small courtyard. The building is like a Georgian townhouse with many architectural details. The first floor has a couple of small sitting areas & a seperate exit to the street instead of going through the main house each time. Our room was right at the top of the first set of stairs. We had a small living room area seperated by a door from the bedroom. We did not have a view & the room was a bit dark but we asked for a quiet room. The room was very quiet with the door to the bathroom closed otherwise street noise could be heard. There is no air conditioner but was not a problem. We actually wanted some heat one cold evening but the building has central heat & the hotel regulates it. Our room was clean & the double bed was comfortable however certain areas could use some refreshing. The bathroom was small & lacked good counter space. The shower had great water & temperature pressure but never drained properly. The included Wifi worked well in all areas. There are a couple house felines, one named princess whom is so sweet. The staff are super friendly & accommodating and truly make it a lovely place to stay. The location is in a nicer quiet area & walking distance to many restaurants, shops & attractions. We took the Aircoach bus to and from the Dublin Airport. Take bus 700 to the 5th stop Leesen Street Lower. Takes about 35 minutes, Drops you off on the same side of street as the hotel with a 5-10 minute walk to hotel. May be challenging with a lot of luggage. The return bus stop is on the opposite side of the street from the drop off stop, picks up every 15 minutes & takes same amount of time to get back to the airport.",4,2017,09,10
216,"Inner city location, walkable","Good centre town location. Breakfast incredible! Proprietors delightful. Place is old which is ok, the 2nd building is Georgian where we stayed. The whole place is a little tired. Pretty expensive but told was because of location. We stayed in 6 different accommodations across Ireland 2 nites each. this one our least favorite. (Heads up, no elevator, may be several flights up which is common here)",4,2017,09,08
216,So grateful for Number 31!,"We booked Number 31 for our first night in Dublin based on Trip Advisor reviews that indicated we could get into our room early if we arrived in the morning.  After a long flight, this was a definite plus, so we decided to try it out.  Sure enough, we arrived at 8 am, and the wonderful hosts at Number 31 welcomed us with a beautiful breakfast, followed by a room at 9:30 am!  This was a lifesaver.  I couldn't be happier with Number 31 - beautiful breakfast area, warm service, great location.  At the end of the trip, we splurged for the Merrion, and that room was definitely more luxurious, but I wouldn't recommend it over Number 31.  Number 31 is tops for personal, friendly service and the best breakfast ever.",5,2017,08,17
216,Can't wait to come back!,"We had the pleasure of staying four nights at the Number 31 and our son joined us for two nights,as well, back in July.  Our first time in Dublin and we found the perfect place. We enjoyed our stay so much that I joined Trip Advisor to write a review.  

Noel and Linda make guests feel like they have known you forever. The location really is perfect to allow for tranquility yet being a short walk to everything Dublin has to offer.    A remarkable property.  It was like returning home each day as we relaxed in the garden, in the sunken couch or in our bright and spacious room. There is no question that breakfast here is the best in Dublin. On our first day we arrived before ten and Linda insisted we have breakfast.  We were not expecting that and what a delight.  Each morning we were greeted with smiles and delicious food. 

Prior to arriving the dates for our son joining us were constantly shifting and Linda was always quick to respond to my emails and was accommodating to our needs. During our stay, Linda and Noel, were both so helpful in dinner suggestions, taxi rides, places to visit and general information.  Our stay was the beginning of a three week vacation and we knew the bar was set very high. 

We look forward to returning to Ireland and we will never look elsewhere for a place to stay.  The best!",5,2017,08,13
216,Everything I hoped for,"Enjoyed a spectacular visit at the Number 31 back in March.  Took me a while to sit down to finally write a review, but refused to not share what an awesome experience I had at this wonderful ""home away from home"" feeling of a hotel/bed and breakfast.  Noel and Linda are the sweetest and super helpful.  I had to cut my visit short because of an ""issue"" with my travel companions and they were nice enough to offer me various options to make my stay in Dublin amazing.  I have recommended their place to several friends back in the U.S. - no other place to stay but Number 31! Phenomenal breakfast and afternoon tea/cookies, great location, fantastic owners, cute rooms (stayed in their largest rooms downstairs meant for a family), cool courtyard...don't miss out on this gem!",5,2017,07,22
216,Excellent bed & breakfast in the Georgian area of Dublin,"We stayed for three nights in this excellent, friendly Georgian House which is spacious with high ceilings, comfortable beds and were provided with a wonderful breakfast. There is a good sitting area with books and a peat fire.
Our rooms were in 30 Fitzwilliam Place which is a separate Georgian building connected to 31 Leeson Close by a small, peaceful garden.
This is an excellent bed & breakfast situated close to St Stephen's Green and walking distance from all the major attractions on the south side of Dublin.",5,2017,07,21
216,Perfect stay in Dublin,"We arrived at Number 31 after a long drive from Cork.  Noel immediately jumped into action, moved our car, brought tea and talked us through the nearby geography of Dublin.  The service was friendly, informal and warm.  The breakfasts were stupendous and the company and conversation in the breakfast room was also warm and friendly like the owner and the employees.  We would go back in a heartbeat.  Thank you Noel and Deirdre!",5,2017,07,19
216,Great Place,"Our room (#18) had large windows which provided ample light, a high ceiling, and lots of old Georgian house charm.  Although there was street noise from Fitzwilliam Place, we got used to it and it wasn't a problem.  Our first impression of the neighborhood when we arrived from our flight before 6am was that it was very quiet, perhaps a bit isolated. We soon discovered that we were wrong on that... there are numerous interesting restaurants within close walking distance and St. Stephens Green & and city center are also only a few minutes walk away.  A VERY nice offer by Number 31 is to invite folks arriving early, like we did, to join other guests for breakfast... and their breakfasts are outstanding!  So we were able to get a good start on our first day in Dublin.  An excellent experience!",5,2017,07,17
216,My Dublin favorit,This is a very cosy place indeed. My favourite when it comes to business trips. Quiet and discrete with high service and lots of privacy. Good beds and nights are silent. A nice fireplace where you can have business meetings. My first priority when it comes to stays in Dublin. Been visiting multiple times. Highly recommended. Hope to be back soon.,5,2017,07,07
216,Old Place means Problems.,"Hotel owners want to sell the mystic of an old place- but nobody wants rooms that have issues.  They blame the age- but age has nothing to do with dirty beds.  Nothing to do with no food service at night. Nothing to do with a tv the size of a quarter- with pixels... Paid a nice penny- and it was a mistake.  Wife and I had a trip and decided to stay 4 nights.  Big mistake.  Left early.  Host are nice, but feel it could be a sales job.",1,2017,07,05
216,Great Hosts in a Quirky Place,"We came in on a Sunday evening after a stay at a Hilton in Syon Park London.  Linda greeted us at the door and put us in Room 14 which is right inside the front door, no windows and an ambient temperature of 75 C with only a noisy fan to circulate the air.  We were given some outstanding recommendations for dinner.  At breakfast the next morning, Noel said they would move us into another room that was in the large house on the other side of the connecting garden.  Room #19 was more like what we were expecting, large, temperate, and a window that looked out at the garden (unfortunately it was damp and wet the four days of our stay).

The breakfasts were wonderful, food was ample, and the communal appalled was great.  We had excellent conversations with folks from Canada, the US, South Africa, and Ireland.  Noel was a great host at breakfast and told us the interesting history of the property.

The rooms deserve to be better finished as some of the furniture looks like it came from a second hand store.  Wi-Fi worked fine and the television had a dvd player that we didn't use.

Some of the complaints found in reviews from two years ago have been addressed but the overall look is still not what it should be. Really plush towels would be nice.   We had a wonderful time and the location was great.

It is overpriced but the host and hosts are  wonderful.  This hotel isn't for those expecting luxury (though it is priced like it).  Would we go back?  Absolutely!",4,2017,06,30
216,Great Visit,Number 31 was a great experience for me and my family. We booked 2 rooms and stayed for 2 nights. Linda was very helpful with getting us oriented to the city and gave us a map and pointed out the points of interest that we needed. The location was perfect for us to walk around the city and to grab the Hop on Hop Off bus near St. Stephens Green. Noel was delightful at breakfast and we had great conversations with him. The homemade breakfasts were so delicious! I would highly recommend and stay there again in a heart beat! Dublin was amazing and it's people both at Number 31 and throughout the city will always be remembered.,5,2017,06,29
216,Loved Number 31,I wish I would have booked two nights at this wonderful establishment. So classy and quiet right in the middle of Dublin. We had a very large room with a couch and fireplace. The breakfast was both tasty and served in a very appealing breakfast room. I will definitely return on my next visit to Dublin.,5,2017,06,25
216,Unique experience with excellent service!,"We stayed at Number 31 at the start of our honeymoon and had an excellent experience here. We were in the room to the right of the sitting area which was had a really interesting 70s style and open concept bathroom--we really enjoyed the charming sitting area. The entire house itself is very beautiful (I don't know much more about the architect himself but there is surely a lot of history you can learn from the owners). Sam welcomed us to the accommodations and showed us a map with his local recommendations for places to eat and things to explore. Easy walk to St. Stephen's Green, Merrion Square and Grafton St shopping area. Breakfast was absolutely delightful with a huge variety of choices: eggs benedict, full Irish, smoked salmon and scrambled eggs, mushroom frittata, porriage to name a few. This was the most upscale of B&Bs that we stayed at during our stay in Ireland.

Only negatives: our room had no accessible windows (1 skylight with permanently drawn shade) so no natural light. It was also located near the front door so guests coming in and out were easily heard. It was also quite pricey for the space we had but we were willing to shell out for something unique and interesting.",4,2017,06,13
216,Charming & In a Great Location,"What a wonderful stay!  A charming spot and in a great location.  Large, comfortable room including a comfortable bed (a must!).  Delicious breakfast.  Friendly and accommodating staff.  A small, lovely garden in the back.  Will return!",5,2017,06,10
216,MARVELOUS EXPERIENCE,"Spent 5 nights at 31 in May, 2017.  Out of the many hostelries we visited in our month-long trip, this was one of the two best.  First, Noel and Linda are intelligent, charming, genuine, funny, helpful and generally wonderful hosts.  The breakfast was one you might find in a top-end restaurant.  We were lucky enough to be at breakfast when Noel's friend Berry Scheck (?) was visiting.  There are three kinds of people: 1. those don't know, 2. those who sort of know, and 3. Those who flat know what they are talking about.  Berry is a 3.  Our room was spacious and a well appointed. The location was convenient to everything in central Dublin.",5,2017,06,05
216,Fantastic find!,I did copious research when selecting Dublin accommodations and we were thrilled!  We received a warm welcome (which included tea and lovely cranberry bread) as we arrived mid-morning and they were finishing with our room. We were guided to great restaurants and pubs that were perfectly aligned with what we were looking for and not crowded with tourists. The room was cozy and well appointed. The owner and staff were warm and helpful and the breakfast was outstanding!  We would highly recommend Number 31 to anyone staying in Dublin ,5,2017,06,03
216,Excellent B&B in terrific location,"We spent 3 nights here; very clean and quiet, delicious breakfast, and friendly helpful owner.  Choice of a wide variety of hot breakfasts. We tried smoked fresh kippers & eggs with smoked salmon.  Very tasty and cooked exactly as we requested.
Can walk to Trinity College & St. Stephen's Green.  
Owner recommended restaurants for dinner; all of them were excellent.",5,2017,06,03
216,"Warm Irish welcome from our host, Noel.","Our group of eight Ohioans stayed two nights at the Number 31 Guesthouse in Dublin last week (May, 2017).  Our host was gracious and welcoming, and his staff offers superb service in a friendly atmosphere.  We loved the delicious breakfasts in the sunroom, enjoying chatting with other guests of all nationalities.  Linda offered useful tips about sights to see, and offered to print tickets for us as we made online reservations.  The rooms were comfortable , and we enjoyed the lounge/pit in front of the fireplace with our group. Bathroom facilities were luxurious and functional.",5,2017,06,01
216,Quaint and Superb Service,This is an old but well care for property. Uniquely one must traverse a handsome formal garden to go from reception and breakfast area to the room. Our's was a three room suite with a very large bathroom and sitting room. Our only challenge was figuring out the correct switch to turn on various lights. Breakfast is included and is a feast and delight. The staff is efficient and attentive and you'll enjoy the diverse breakfast menu. Not to be missed is the homemade bread. ,5,2017,05,29
216,Best porridge in Ireland!,"Well, that I had anyway, and I looked hard to find better (it's all wonderful). This is a wonderful hotel/B and B. Not sure which Is formally call it. Huge room. Comfortable bed. Good location. Fairly walkable to most locations. Nearby resteraunts and pubs. All in what looks like a restored late 19th century mansion.  Loved it. Great service. Wonderful. Breakfast. ",5,2017,05,28
216,Wonderful inn,"My daughter and I stayed there for 5 nights.  The accommodations were excellent.  The hosts are extremely helpful.  Linda gave us wonderful suggestions for dining and places of interest.  The bereakfasts each morning were great, and it was fun to chat with other guests.  The inn is conveniently located, close to St. Stephen's Green.",5,2017,05,26
216,Exceptional experience!,"A terrifically intimate hotel in a great location, with World Class Service. Noel and staff have made my wife and I and our family, welcome now for over 15 years. It simply is the only place we would stay in Dublin, truly Irish and wonderfully friendly.",5,2017,05,19
216,"Great Place, Outstanding Staff","Highly recommend. Very good location, nice area, convenient for St Stephen's Green, Central Dublin. Noel, Sean, Adam and staff were extremely helpful with dining advice, other reservations, contacting previous B&B re lost item, taxi arrangements and even a wonderful dialogue about a branch of the family tree in County Tipperary. Breakfast was excellent, A+; thank you Linda & Delia. And Tony as well.",5,2017,05,16
216,First class hosts and accommodation,"What a find! Yes, expect the best breakfast in Dublin.  Yes, expect the best night's sleep in Dublin. And yes, expect the very best in hospitality and warmth from owners Noel and Deirdre - nothing is too much trouble.

Sadly we were staying for just one night en route to a wedding, but if we'd been staying longer in Dublin we would not have hesitated to use Number 31 as our longer-term base - ideally located no more than 10-15 minutes walk into the heart of Dublin's cultural centre.

Noel's welcome was so friendly - he took care of our car parking and brought us complementary tea and coffee to drink by the open fire, instantly relaxing us after a delayed flight and traffic problems.

Engage Noel in the history of Number 31 and he will recount amusing stories of the 1960s and 1970s when parties for the rich and famous were thrown in the contemporary Sam Stephenson-designed building at the end of the quaint and manicured Georgian town house garden - there are a few very well appointed bedrooms in this building (the others are in the Georgian townhouse at the other end of the garden), plus the sunken living space to relax and read by the open fire.  This building also houses the kitchen and breakfast area - whatever you do, don't oversleep (which is possible here as the beds and bed linen are the best quality money can buy) - the breakfast is indeed a truly great experience, not just because of the quality of the cooking and choice of food available, but the views, advice, chatter and stories from Noel in particular that go with it. You feel privileged to be part of the history of this place.

It was a shame our visit was so short, but when we return we'll not hesitate to stay at Number 31 again. A great place and the very best hosts who really do make your stay a special one - thank you!",5,2017,05,15
216,Wonderful experience,"It's a warm and welcoming experience.  The owner and staff are terrific, generous, and helpful.  All steps are taken to make you happy.  I would recommend getting a twin bedded room if you are used to American king beds.",5,2017,04,25
216,Great place to stay in Dublin!,"The hotel is amazing - we stayed in the Georgian townhouse in a family room - and there was plenty of space for the four of us.  We loved walking through the garden to breakfast each day.  Breakfast is wonderful, and they were so accommodating!  Loved the shower and the heated towel rack.  The hotel is centrally located, and I would definitely recommend to anyone wanting a top-notch oasis in the middle of the city!",5,2017,04,21
216,"Number 31, a gem","We loved No. 31--not an overstatement to label it one of our top hotel experiences.  

Lovely hotel and grounds, ideal location, relaxed feel in a beautifully appointed facility with top-of-the-line details (Haston's mattresses, etc.).  

The owner, Noel, and all of his staff couldn't have been more welcoming or accommodating.  

And the breakfasts.  We arrived to check in (ragged from our all-night flight from the US) after the end of breakfast service, but they fired up the burners to whip up a Full Irish.  On our final day, I awoke in a bit of a state: which dish, of all those sampled/savored, to pick for our send-off? (decision: the perfectly scrambled eggs and incomparable smoked salmon).  

(Tip: No. 31's incomparable Irish Brown Bread and Cranberry Bread recipes online.)",5,2017,04,19
216,Friendly and Quirky ,"Dublin is a friendly city and our hosts at Number 31 certainly contributed to this atmosphere. As soon as we arrived we were sat down to a cafetière of fresh coffee and slices of homemade orange and cranberry loaf. 
Reception has a sunken lounge and a peat fire.
The accommodation building was originally a Georgian townhouse which has been tastefully restored so has decorated ceilings etc.
After we had finished this we were escorted to our room. Spacious and comfortable. Bathroom was modern and well appointed 
Breakfast was an event. Cereals, fruit etc followed by a choice of cooked (including the ""full Irish "") served with fresh coffee and homemade soda bread and the orange and cranberry described above. Hosts made us incredibly welcome all the way.
Only criticism, and this is a criticism I would level at most, is the lack of a  good well light mirror with adjacent plug point so the ladies can do their hair and makeup.",5,2017,04,14
216,Best B&B I have ever stayed in!,"Pure delight from the moment you get there to the minute we left! The breakfast was a real treat, but the warm welcome and gorgeous rooms got the top marks!

Would highly reconmend for couple weekend away.",5,2017,04,14
216,Great stay,"Delightful stay. The staff were friendly and very helpful throughout. The owner, Noel, was the consummate host, welcoming us for an early check-in with tea and freshly baked bread. Linda was instrumental in helping me address my husband's illness while there, phoning a doctors' service and giving me directions to a local chemist. Our room was beautiful, warmly decorated, quiet and comfortable. Of course, the full Irish breakfasts cannot be compared. Finally, a taxi was arranged for our trip to the airport - a taxi company that provides clean and comfortable cars (we traveled in a nice Mercedes sedan) that was similar in price to other competitors. All in all, a b and b we would gladly return to in the future!",5,2017,04,13
216,Tremendous hosts and Delicious Breakfasts!,"My husband and I visited this B&B at the recommendation of my cousin.  We spent a total of 6 nights at this lovely cozy, clean, hospitable Inn and we were delighted with the service and staff!  ""Overjoyed"" is really a better word to describe it and here's why:

We were in Dublin to visit with our college daughter who is studying at UC Dublin for the semester.  We were stressing a bit when the time came to fly over from the US since we needed to arrive one day earlier than scheduled in order to beat the arrival of a late spring snowstorm.  When I emailed asking if we could arrive early, they were so gracious (since it was St. Patrick's Day week and we were pretty sure other places were full!). BUT the kindness didn't stop there.  

Our daughter met us at the Number 31 on the morning of our arrival.  She got there before us and they sat her down and gave her tea and toast.  Once we arrived, the owner Noel insisted that we ALL sit down as a family after our long flight from the US and have a beautifully cooked-to-order Irish breakfast.  He did this despite the fact that we arrived well after the time their regular guests had finished. I was so relieved that I almost cried at his kindness.

Their cook Delia is a delight.  Best cooked breakfasts and homemade brown bread ever!   The variety of the food offered is so generous.  Fresh fruits and berries; breads; yogurt; and cereals are available buffet style and then they offer a number of fully cooked breakfast options to order.  This generous selection of beautiful foods is offered every morning and they don't skimp on portions.  Plenty of beautiful smoked salmon and wonderful pressed coffee urns.  I could go on and on.

But, the kindness didn't  stop there.  Once they learned our daughter was a 15 minute bus ride away from us at the suburban UC Dublin campus, the owner Noel kindly offered that our daughter stay overnight since they had an extra room available!  In fact he insisted......it would have been hard to resist Noel, he has a gentle, 'I'll take care of you' confidence and 'don't you worry 'bout a thing!' manner.  And, yes, we did take him up on his offer for the complimentary room for two of the nights!  And our daughter was able to join us for breakfasts every morning while we were touring in Dublin.  I almost cried at his kindness.

Noel also provided expert advice including maps and explanations about area attractions and the many restaurants within walking distance.  This place is ideally situated just a block or 2 from St. Stephen's Green. They arranged taxis for us when needed and took a genuine interest in our plans.  

When we checked out, Noel offered to be our 'Irish connection' in the event our daughter needed anything.  He even invited her to come back for breakfast if she was hungry. Okay, that DID make me cry.   

I feel like we gained some family members at Number 31.  There are simply not enough words to describe my enthusiasm for this place.  Our stay at Number 31 was a lovely introduction to Ireland.  Thank you!  We'll be back :)",5,2017,04,02
216,Very good could be perfect,"All this lovely B and B needs to be really perfect is a desk or dressing table and decent lighting in the bedrooms and tea/coffee making facilities
Otherwise comfortable warm rooms very comfortable beds bathrooms good ,breakfasts exceptional and owner and his team super",4,2017,03,26
216,Super charming small hotel,"Loved this place!  Quiet, great staff, big rooms, and the best breakfast you'll find anywhere!  We'll be back!  The lobby alone is a hoot, with a mirrored reception desk and a conversation pit to relax in!",5,2017,02,05
216,"Quirky, friendly hotel","Great hotel recommended by a friend, ab breakfadt and super friendly staff. Only downside was the rooms location as it was very noisy as people walked on the landing/main door as the room was below and curtains had to be drawn for privacy. Would definitely stay again but request alternative room!",4,2017,01,28
216,Fantastic Boutique Hotel in Dublin,"Stayed in Number 31 last weekend on a trip to Dublin to see friends.  I'd thoroughly recommend it to anyone looking for a great value and very stylish place for a Dublin visit.  Our room was very comfortable, the hosts were very welcoming and the breakfast (which I'd built up high expectations for having read reviews) was fantastic, really delicious.  The location is ideal for shops, bars, restaurants, sites.. and handy for the airport. A properly good hotel!",5,2017,01,23
216,Great boutique hotel in Central Dublin. ,"Stayed here with some friends, location is perfect for the centre of Dublin and the breakfast is as good as its reputation. The design of the hotel is great and you can feel at home in front of the open fire. The team are there to help but also leave you to enjoy the space. It is on the more expensive side and felt just slightly overpriced but if that doesn't bother you a good place to stay. ",4,2017,01,07
216,Different,"Hidden gem, but in need of some love and care. Beautiful architecture. My room was next to the entrance at ground level, so needed to keep curtain closed at all times to have some privacy. Some fixtures in the bathroom needed attention. No desk to sit or work at in the room. Very friendly staff, good breakfast, beautiful decorated.",4,2017,01,05
216,Tremendous Service!,"We had a rough time getting to Dublin from the US due to some extreme incompetence from the airline (don't fly Aer Lingus). By the time we got there, we were incredibly tired and frustrated; not a great way to start a trip. But the kind and friendly staff at Number 31 relieved us of all our frustrations with their impeccable customer service and trendy, yet quaint hotel. Absolutely stunning public areas, warm cozy rooms, and light airy breakfast area. The food was FANTASTIC and fresh, perfect to start your day. Location was perfect, walkable to Grafton St and right across from St Stevens Green (a mini Central Park in Dublin). One of the younger staff members brought us a map of Dublin and drew out exactly where all the best sites were and also the best pubs and restaurants! He helped us tactfully plan our 1 day in Dublin since we lost a day due to the airline. It was incredibly helpful and kind of him! On our last morning, Nole, the owner, packed us a lunch of fresh salmon and breads and gave us lots of great tips for our hike at Glendalock. These people could not have made us feel more at home or more special. If we come back to Dublin in the future, we will definitely be staying here. ",5,2016,11,20
216,Great!,"We stayed for two nights on the recommendation of a friend. It's a beautiful hotel with outstanding and personal service and the breakfast is superb - the eggs benedict is easily in my top 5 worldwide!

",5,2016,11,13
216,"Hidden gem, Outstanding breakfast","Wonderful room, great reception, outstanding breakfast. Must have the cranberry walnut loaf.
Staff incredibly friendly! Wished we could have stayed longer.
Hidden gem tucked away in the heart of Dublin!",5,2016,10,31
216,The best 40th holiday! ,"Just returned from a 2 night stay at Hotel31 for my 40th birthday . Oh my word. It was perfect. Discreet, luxurious, understated, classy and a brilliant location. The breakfasts were something else and I looked forward to it each morning. Thanks so much for our gorgeous room too. I was dreading turning 40 but this has set the tone for the next decade!! Please if you're going to Dublin don't stay in a big boring hotel, for only a tiny bit more (and in some cases not) it's so worth it. Keep doing what you're doing Hotel 31, you are getting it so right!!  Thank you Dublin. Jo and Lee Wood.",5,2016,10,24
216,Outstanding hospitality.,"We arrived very early on the first day of our trip to Ireland.  Not only were our rooms ready, we were treated to a fabulous breakfast free of charge!  We were fueled up and ready to hit the streets of Dublin by 9 a.m.!  This property is in a wonderful location and we were made to feel like part of the family.",5,2016,10,18
216,Brilliant in every way,"This is the best place that I've stayed in Dublin. Many hotels are either old-fashioned or with borrowed character (Miami-style, etc.). This boutique hotel has absolute individuality, a charming and comforting courtyard, cozy and clean rooms, unbelievable service, and a divine breakfast. Let me just spend a moment on the service, because it is truly outstanding. The warmth and care that you get overall in a wonderful representation of Irish character and hospitality and they are fantastic ambassadors of their people. I would recommend anyone to come here. Your stay in Dublin will be positively magnified.",5,2016,10,13
216,Perfect Oasis & Amazing Hospitality,"Super cool, have stayed her twice. Perfect location in Dublin, love the interiors & the breakfast was delicious. The staff were all so welcoming & chatty, really relaxing stay & loved the big fire pit area so cool, felt like we were stepping back in time....def best place to stay in Dublin City centre!! ",5,2016,10,06
216,Near St. Stephen's Green,"My husband and I stayed at Number 31 for 3 nights.  This was our first visit to Ireland.  We were greeted by Linda who gave us a great introduction to our location in Dublin and excellent suggestions for dinners.  We had Suite No. 16 in the Georgian part of the B&B.  While the room was large and the bathroom quite new, there was a transom window in our room whereby the bright pot lights outside our door shone through to the bedroom.  Made it difficult for sleeping. The drain in the shower was very very slow and appeared to be close to overflowing after both of us had a shower.  However, breakfasts were delicious and plentiful with lots of choices and Noel was the ultimate host serving the food while telling stories about the history of the B&B.",4,2016,09,26
216,Excellent boutique experience in central Dublin,"Having lived abroad for more than 7 years, I always struggled to find a central Dublin hotel which I wanted to come back to, until 31. The hotel provides luxury, comfort, and an oasis of calm in a central location, but also a laid back and welcoming atmosphere epitomised by Noel and Linda's attentive but non invasive care for their guests. The lobby is a great space to chat, drink tea or read the papers, and the cooked to order breakfast is excellent. An excellent boutique experience for Dublin city center.",5,2016,09,26
216,Great Location !,"Location is great!  Other than that ,the place has some issues. Do not stay in rooms # 10, 11, 12 or 14 if you are claustrophobic. These rooms have very low ceilings, very little or no outside ventilation and give you the feel of staying in a WWII bunker.
Room # 14 has no window at all, only a non-opening skylight. 
The hotel is within easy walking distance of St, Stephens Green. It has a funky layout, reminded me of a California design house of the 1980s. It needs some TLC.  Furniture in the lobby conversation pit shows a lot of wear. They won an award for their breakfast in 2008; it is no award winner now.  There is nothing wrong with the breakfast, just an ordinary offering for 2016.
The hotel is not ADA friendly, no elevators or handrails. If you are allergic to cats be warned that cats have free access to the public rooms.
If you book here make sure you get an upstairs room with a functional window.",3,2016,09,25
216,Hidden gem in the centre of Dublin,"We had the most perfect experience of Number 31 from beginning to end. We were looking for a hotel for one night either side of our wedding in Dublin, close to all amenities, so we could get around and do all the last minute bits and bobs easily. My husband and his groomsmen stayed the night before the wedding, and we stayed there as newlyweds the night after our wedding. Noel and Linda are the epitome of great hosts. They have time to greet and welcome you, and get to know you, you feel like you're at home with friends instantly.

The hotel itself is immaculate; very clean, well maintained, very central, yet off the main road so very quiet. It's almost like an oasis in the city. They say breakfast is the most important meal of the day - well at Number 31 you feast on breakfast! A fantastic spread is laid out for you. We really couldn't fault it and would recommend the hotel without hesitation.

Well done guys! We'll be back :)",5,2016,09,23
216,Delightful!,"We love this place! Our second visit and it was just as good as our first. Will definitely return when we go back to Dublin. Very friendly staff. Huge breakfast (never needed to have lunch) with choice of eggs, also toast, yoghurt, fruit, cereals and oatmeal (porridge). Large room (#19) overlooking the courtyard. Convenient location, close to excellent restaurants, pubs and sites.",5,2016,09,19
216,Nice Property in a good location,"really enjoyed the time we spent in Dublin and thought i enjoyed my time at #31 however on my last day I overheard another couple asking for the smoked salmon eggs benedict they had the day before. this dish was never offered to us. the owner was a bit mercurial but seemed nice enough, clearly if he likes you you get extras.",3,2016,09,16
216,A home away from home. . .in Dublin!,"From the time I arrived, I felt as though I had landed in the home of a friend, rather than just having a place to stay for my 5 nights in Dublin. The staff are awesome, loved the leisurely and delicious breakfasts each morning - cooked to order, and could have stayed a month had time allowed. I'd definitely recommend Number 31 to anyone visiting Dublin - great location, great people, and service-oriented in a way that made the trip a breeze. Thank you!! Next time I'm in Dublin, I'll be staying at Number 31!!",5,2016,09,05
216,Wonderful Start to a Two Week Vacation ,"The owners OD Number 31, Noel and Deirdre, have put together a winning combination of great lodging, food and customer service. When we arrived on Saturday morning, Noel immediately fed us a delicious breakfast and afterwards let us check into our room early. We had traveled overnight so it was really nice to clean up and head out to see the sights. You can't beat the location as it is a very short walk to St. Stephens Green and many important sites. It is next to a Starbucks!",5,2016,09,03
216,"Charming, Quirky & Centrally Located","Loved our stay at No. 31 -- many charms, but also some quirks to know about:

Charms:
* Warm, enthusiastic hospitality from the owners and staff. Noel, the host, should be mayor. Adam was particularly helpful with recommendations and directions. We were greeted with french pressed coffee and warm cookies, invited to sit by the fire, and given quite a bit of attention and ideas for our trip.
* Breakfasts are not to be missed --it won't be quick, but it will be delightful. Held in a lovely sunroom surrounded by greenery, Noel and staff serves up a full breakfast made to order with homemade pastries, fresh berries, omelettes, Irish tea or french press coffee, etc. (If one wants a quick breakfast, there is a Starbuck's next door.)
*The location is perfect -- a 5 min walk to either Merrion Sq or St Stephen's Green. We traversed most of the city on foot --close to everything.
* No. 31 consists of two building connected by a courtyard, one of which was designed by an architect of some note. Nothing about No 31 looks standard -- the check in desk alcove is mirrored, the lobby area features a sunken seating area and high ceilings, etc. Much more interesting than a standard hotel.

Quirks:
* Rooms can vary in terms of size, noise level, etc -- Our group of 4 had two rooms, one of which was at least 30% bigger than the other (with much taller ceilings), even though we reserved as a block. 
* No a/c (at least not in our room) -- usually not a problem given Dublin's weather, but worth keeping in mind if you're visiting in July.
* No outlets in the bathroom beyond a plug for shavers.",5,2016,09,02
216,Fantastic Stay!,"What is not to love about this place? My husband and I were greeted with a tray of coffee, tea and cookies while checking in. We were in the back house on the top floor, and we were helped with our bags all the way there and up the stairs. We are healthy so we didn't mind the stairs :) There is a nice courtyard connecting the main and back building, and there were the neighbor's cats there, and the black one is VERY friendly, if you're a cat person! Each morning was a hot cooked breakfast. As soon as you sat down, bread and orange juice was brought out to you. (I don't know what they put into the bread but it's addicting and I'm having withdrawal and would love a loaf sent to Boston, please.) We were offered a few options for breakfast: porridge, the full irish (eggs, sausage, bacon, blood pudding (I think that's what it was?), tomato, potato cake), scrambled eggs with smoked salmon, frittata, and one other thing I can't remember. They also have cereal and fruit for you. After the first day it felt like a family breakfast, and it was great talking to other guests and seeing where they come from, what their trip entails, etc. The owners are very present, and such a joy. They greeted us every day at breakfast! In the room, the bathroom is beautifully updated and the bed is soft and comfy! Everything about this place is amazing, and was recommended to us by a colleague who stayed here. There is literally nothing you won't like about this place!",5,2016,08,29
216,A true Gem.,"We Stayed at Number 31 Early June 2016. Myself, my girlfriend, and three of our closest friends. We had traveled from Canada. I cannot recommend No 31 highly enough for all the right reasons. No 31 is the epitome of Boutique. The rooms are tastefully and artfully decorated, appointed with a perfect balance of modern influences that marry perfectly with the historic Georgian pedigree of the buildings. The mews section off Leeson Close is joined to the main townhouse on Fitzwilliam Place via a delightful tranquil garden. The staff are among the most genuinely friendly and helpful I have ever encountered. I would highly recommend going to breakfast hungry, their breakfast is not probably the best breakfast in Ireland as claimed on their website, it most definitely is the best breakfast in Ireland. I am originally from Dublin and can safely say that I have never felt so welcome and so well looked after in my home city. Two of our party had never visited Ireland or Dublin before, so they were spoiled,that said they are planning a return trip  and will,be staying at No 31 again. The experience for our group was flawless and guarantees our return and our follow on recommendation to any of our other friends seeking accommodation in the heart of the best little city in the world.",5,2016,08,29
216,Charming,"While a bit of a challenge to find even with our GPS, it was worth it. Noel, our host, assisted us with parking and getting settled in. He is delightful and most helpful as you would expect from this charming boutique hotel. 
It is located in a great spot in Dublin. You can walk everywhere from here. Luckily, the weather was spectacular and we were able to take advantage of our walks both during the day and at night as it stayed light late. 
Our room was well appointed but a bit constrained. Still very comfortable. The shower was great, but in typical European style, no door, so water splashed everywhere. The shower mats worked overtime!
Number 31's breakfast are renowned and justifiably so. Big Irish portions. Noel is the dining room impressario. taking orders, asking what everybody was doing, providing useful suggestions and helping out with reservations. All the guests seemed very convivial as Noel's charm was infectious.
I would have liked to see the other rooms off Fitzwilliam place.
Surprisingly reasonable given the attention of the owner, the location, the comfort and charm of this delightful hotel.",4,2016,08,27
216,The whole family loved it here,"Our family of 5 stayed in 2 rooms in the Georgian building (Superior double + Superior triple) for 4 nights. The rooms were huge, with high ceilings. But the best part was the cheerful host, Noel. Our whole family looked forward to seeing him at the fabulous breakfasts each morning.  Other highlights were the sunken fireplace with a peat fire & the greenhouse-style breakfast room. Yes, like other reviewers have said, it was expensive to book 2 rooms here, but when I looked at alternatives to staying here, most of the other options seemed just about as pricey. Dublin is not a cheap city to visit. For us it was a wonderful experience staying at Number 31 & we have great memories of our time here.",5,2016,08,22
216,Wonderful hospitality,"Noel and his staff made us feel welcome from the moment we arrived. We felt as though we were visiting friends rather than staying at a hotel.  Our family will remember and talk about the breakfasts at #31 for a long while-everything from full Irish to scrambled eggs with smoked salmon to a delicious porridge, all prepared and served professionally and with full attention to detail while maintaining a friendly and informal feel.  The location was great for us-within walking distance of many Dublin sights.  Our room was comfortable and quiet even with an entrance close to the street. Would absolutely choose to stay there again.",4,2016,08,22
216,Charming place in perfect area,"Arriving we were greeted warmly by one of the staff and given tea and coffee while we waited for our rooms to be ready. The owners are incredibly knowledgable about Dublin and gave us an overview of the sites and places to eat and how to get their. Our rooms were in a nicely appointed Georgian house. The rooms are spacious and comfortable. Breakfast was fantastic and not the usual Irish fare, many choices are available.",5,2016,08,19
216,"a city break, catching up with old friends","A great place to take a city break and meet up with old friends before heading South and West. #31 is well placed to make the most of the city, we decided to walk most of it and found all 4 corners quite accessible. The house is gorgeous, a reminder of a glorious past yet with all the modern conveniences. Noel is  a host you will not easily forget, friendly, knowledgeable and greats you every morning with a smile. The food is to die for.",4,2016,08,17
216,Wonderful,"Hosts are fantastic. Breakfast is wonderful. Rooms are comfortable but a little warm in summer. The hosts were very helpful with directions, restaurant recommendations and attraction information.  They were kindhearted and very friendly.",4,2016,08,17
216,Great B&B,We spent 3 nights at Number 31.the hosts were terrific and very helpful. They recommended very good restaurants for dinner. It is near St.Stephen's Green and thus within easy walking distance to many of the sights in Dublin. The facility is modern and the room very comfortable. The breakfasts were good with many options. We would return again and recommend it.,5,2016,08,10
216,Very friendly host and to die for breakfast,"Noel and his wife were very attentive owners of this establishment and could not do enough for you. The choice of breakfast was varied and brilliant, excellent full Irish. Although there are lots of stairs to get to the rooms, they are very spacious and Noel and his team will help with luggage",5,2016,08,10
216,Hmm... Charm with challenges.,"If you meet Noel, the proprietor, you will instantly feel as though anything short of a five-star review would be wickedly disloyal to this charming host. His good nature is infectious. His breakfasts are gorgeous, high quality and plentiful, as advertised. 

I'm afraid I'm going to have to agree fully with the critics who argue for the prices being out of step with the property. While I am a lover of quirk, and I appreciate entrpreneurs who do it their way, and I grew up in hundred year-old Victorian in San Francisco, full of odd corners, old glass windows and ""issues"" so am not afraid old buildings... or even hauling my own luggage up and down and across gardens and several flights of stairs (you should see the house I grew up in - a mile of stairs up a hill to the front door, we nearly killed granny every Christmas she came to stay).. while I am ulber tolerant and welcoming of idiosyncratic hospitality and funky design... I am not a fan of any property that makes me walk a country mile for a cup of tea or coffee... or run all over the bloody place seeking assistance with bags, or coffee, or checking out.

Ultimately for me, the main gripe was a teensy little room with two (ok quality) beds but with a giant non-opening single-pane glass window that looks down on Leeson Street which - for the uninitiated - is effectively a dual carriageway in the middle of Dublin. To be plain, I wouldn't lease that room as office space, much less sleeping accommodation, because of the incessant rumble of traffic.  One *can* sleep of course. We did. But lord.. tiny tiny room, rumble rumble from the street... oh my god another country mile to get a cup of tea (nothing in the room) and where is the staff who will help with ""x"" or ""y""? (Answer, go to the other building and find lovel Noel or his minions because the little ladies who do housekeeping will look at you blankly and do zip for you unless it involves a sheet or a towel).

So there's a geography issue.  If you're in the yummy old Georgian building with high ceilings and funky/cool/hip decor, a building that desperately cries out for a bit of a refit, you will be miiiiiiiiles away from a human being who can do something for you. And since there is no in-room kettle or anything, you will need to hike it.  You will receive a polite lecture upon arrival that there is no room service.  Again, fine - really. But can I have a kettle near by then?  Really, at nearly 300/Euro a night for a postage stamp sized room that rumbles with every passing lorry, I'd think a kettle (purchased for what, 20 Euro?) would be feasible - no? Not even in the downstairs lobby of the old house?  Yes I'm sure you could.  

This is one of the challenges in an older and quirky property - how much quirk gets in the way of a nice time.  In my case, one night in the Salon de Carriageway and I was ready to lose my cool in the most undignified fashion.  But then...

Then we had breakfast. And in pops Noel to the gorgeous, light-filled breakfast room. He's fairly bubbling away with his list of breakfast options, making suggestions. In come the young folk with lovely bread and instantly replenished cafe presse for maman.  Maman's annoyance at the carriageway room melts in the face of a perfec plate of kippers and eggs. Child is transported by the perfection of a giant plate of Eggs Benedict with sumptuous, velvety handmade Hollandaise.  

So here is the thing... Number 31 is quirky.  Noel quite obviously likes it that way, as do many guests (I'm betting with rooms facing away from Leeson Street).  Perhaps the schlep to the tea and coffee is fine for many. But lord, love, can you not make a tea kettle handy and do something about the windows for those of us paying high season rates for El Postage Stamp Room-o? 

Not long ago I visited a friend at the Intercontinental Dublin (formerly Four Seasons) where rates were (and still are today apparently) about 10% higher than No. 31 and - let's face it - overflowing with service, all mod cons, lifts, tea kettle in room (!).  

When returning to Dublin I would be so honored to dine at Noel's table again. He is a lovely fellow and my god his team put out a gorgeous breakfast.  But I'd really like to see him either get the builders in, or bring down the price on a few of those rooms. 

Out of sync, is the problem.  Quirk, noise, long haul transport to tea... those things are fine and dandy when you're south of the 200 Euro per night area. When you push towards 300, as we had to do in high season, the value proposition - for this experienced, pro-quirk traveler - goes away.

If you're going to book Number 31, I'd get on the phone and really make a human being discuss the room, it's location in the property, its quirks.  Your tolerance for noise and distance, and stairs and things...  Not because any one of these things is intolerable - obviously they're not.  But there is too much idiosyncrasy here to judge the experience for all.  Overall, though I think the darling proprietor is pushing that value envelope *quite* far... So caution, and get on the phone if you're going to book here.",3,2016,08,09
216,Overrated and overpriced. To be avoided!,"234 euros for a dark, tiny basement room? Ridiculous. Plus, despite what other reviews say about a charming Georgian house, the decor is half Georgian and half 1970s disco dance hall. Finally, the location, although only a short walk from St Stephens Green, is in an area of mainly offices that is bereft of life and charm. I have reviewed many places, 95 percent of the time very favorably. I feel called to warn fellow travelers off this place as a really misleading exception to the Irish propensity to deliver well what they promise to deliver.",2,2016,08,07
216,Cosy boutique B&B,"We stayed here for New Year's Eve 2014-2015. 

Our first room was lovely and spacious (in the Georgian wing). Bed and pillows were comfortable. Our second room was in the main building and smaller but equally comfortable (we spend a night away in Galway).

The breakfasts here are really, really big! We thought the cereal, toast, fruit and yoghurt bar was the main meal but a full cooked breakfast followed that. The eggs benedict / royale and Irish breakfast were both very good, the black pudding especially so.

The location was a little away from the main sights in Dublin but only 15 minutes away. The staff were attentive and helpful and gave us a good dinner recommendation for our first night there. There was a lit fire in the living pit and It felt very homely and cosy.

Would stay there again for sure.",5,2016,08,01
216,"Location, location, location,  a perfect choice","This type of lodging is not perhaps everyone's cup of tea.  But it certainly was ours.  We stayed  4 nights on the top floor during that very hot spell.  Yes, it was a long way up to climb the flights of steps, but we found that a good thing (we are in early 60's)as we had such a grand breakfast to burn off.  I would suggest if one isn't up to the hike up to request a lower floor room.  Yes, it was very warm but the window opened with ease.  We weren't expecting for the place to have A/C. Yes, there was some city noise, but not much; certainly not much compared to any other old building in a major city that is located so close the city center. Yes, the room was not spacious, again not a surprise for an old quaint and interesting establishment.  We found the room and inn perfect for our needs.  It was clean, tidy, quiet, fairly recently appointed with a modern bathroom.  One just needs to look at the pictures posted to see exactly what you will get.  We highly recommend Number 31 to anyone looking for a place with some charm and personal attention.  Breakfast was fabulous.  We did share tables and all guests we met were very friendly and willing to share conversation.  Owners and staff met all of our expectations.  Most other reviews do a fair job o describing layout.",4,2016,07,30
216,A Wonderful Place to Stay,"My wife and I stayed at Number 31 for the Centennial celebrations in March. The room we got was very large and comfortable and had a huge bathroom with separate bathtub and shower. Breakfast was amazing! Several large, freshly prepared, hot meals to choose from. Lots of fresh fruit, yogurt, and cereals, and breads. The owners are lovely people with lots of good advice on sites to see, routes to take, time to travel, and much more. The staff are all very friendly and helpful. Conveniently located just a few blocks south of St Stephens Green, it is a fair walk or a short cab ride from most attractions. I hope we get the opportunity to stay here again soon!",5,2016,07,30
216,Best breakfast in Dublin,"My wife and I stayed here for the first two nights of our visit to Ireland.  The property is divided into a Georgian house and a modern one, where breakfast is served.  We stayed in the Georgian house, which was quite nice.  The room was a bit warm because we arrived on the warmest day of the year in Dublin and the rooms are not air conditioned.  It cooled down at night so the sleeping temperature was comfortable.   The property is a little off of the beaten path, but only a 5 minute walk from St Stephens Green and 15 minutes from Trinity College.  The highlight of the stay was breakfast, which was fantastic.  Seating for breakfast is at a communal table, providing for interesting conversation with other guests, overseen by the innkeeper Noel.  If you need a cab, the chef's husband is a cab driver and provided great service.",5,2016,07,23
216,Wonderful Irish Hospitality,"We stayed here two nights, the beginning of a two week vacation.  Our flight arrived from the states at 8 am and we were welcomed with open arms to enjoy a hearty breakfast before even checking in!  Noel couldn't have been more helpful with any needs we had.  I loved coming into the property and smelling the peat moss burning in the fireplace.  Yes, even at the end of June!",5,2016,07,22
216,"Wonderful, caution: no elevator!!","Classy, great location, lovely staff, great food but our room was on the fifth floor and there was no elevator. It was a work out especially if you are not in shape. Note: the staff carried our bags up all the stairs. Also-- no tea or coffee in the room as in all the other places we stayed. ",5,2016,07,22
216,Not worth the price,"I was extremely excited about staying at Number 31 after reading the reviews and even seeing the charming buildings when we arrived.  But pretty much from then it went downhill.   First of all, it was extremely noisy.  Not just city noise, I actually enjoy those sounds.  But from your room you can hear everything- toilets flushing (and what goes before that), water running, every door that opens and person walking in the hall, even a poor coughing man in another room that was up all night.  If you need anything (ice, extra towels, iron), you have to call as there isn't a reception area that is manned.  But the problem with that is that they don't always answer the phone.  One night I was having a mechanical issue and had to walk all around both buildings to find someone. Speaking of that issue, I was not impressed by the maintenance.  In addition to the mechanical issue that we had, there was a huge crack in the shower door, a large burn in a piece of furniture in our room, filled ashtrays in the courtyard that went unemptied for days.  I hate to go on and on, but there were so many disappointments, that I don't want anyone to book at this hotel unless you understand fully what you will get for your money.",2,2016,07,20
216,"Loved it, maybe slightly over priced...","We had such a great stay in this hotel. It's in such a nice spot near nice pubs, restaurants, St Stephen's park. The owner and staff are very friendly and the breakfast was great! Only reason I gave a 4 not 5 is that I felt it was quite expensive when a few little things were missing from our room such as a fridge, bath, dressing gowns. The sunken living room is lovely to sit by the fire and have a lovely coffee and homemade cookie. Oh our room was also by the kitchen and I am such a light sleeper that I woke at 7. I wouldn't let any of this put you off though!",4,2016,07,13
216,Overrated,"I payed a real fortune for a very tiny dark room. (it was a weekend in dublin where prices shot up, but that was really expensive).
The breakfast is really good,  people didnt exagerate, and the location is equally good, very nice area. but again, the room was dark, tiny and one of those where there was no tea facilities in the room.",3,2016,07,12
216,"Well located, charming B&B","Fresh off a flight from Dubai via a 3 hour layover in Heathrow, things were not off to a good start when I was shown a miniscule, dark basement room in the Georgian House as my 'deluxe' abode for the next 3 nights. Quite apart from its size, I would not have liked my chances in the event of a fire.

Although, with due credit to the establishment, when I took (very jetlagged) issue, they moved me without fuss into a larger room in the mews house, albeit it was right next to the kitchen. From speaking with fellow guests at breakfast the next morning, I learnt that my experience as a first time guest was not an isolated one.

That said, the palaver of the previous night was forgotten as I sat down to breakfast, which was quite a spread: a buffet of fruit and cereal and selection of hot a la carte dishes. 

I was a little reticent to stay in a B&B - sorry, 'boutique hotel' - as I generally like to be left alone at breakfast as I'm not the most spritely in the morning. But I needn't have worried too much, in spite of the communal seating arrangement. Staff were (mostly) wearily friendly and Noel seemed to focus his Anglo-Irish attention on the American return guests - lucky them. 

More use should really be made of the fantastic sunken lounge in the modernist reception area - an honesty bar perhaps - but I suspect that the proprietors don't trust the guests not to turn a civilised nightcap into a Bacchanalia. It's a dead space otherwise. 

Other than at breakfast, I was not offered tea or anything of the sort during my stay - the staff mostly kept to the office just off the kitchen.

And to be clear - the price you're paying here is for the 'charm', rather than the commodious rooms or state of the art facilities, and the relatively central location on the more affluent south side.",3,2016,07,11
216,very peaceful hotel,"We stayed 1 night at the Number 31, which is a cute little place located on a side street from the main road. It has 2 houses that connect in the backyards, and overall, the hotel has a sort of old-timey, homey feel to it. We were welcomed with tea and biscuits when we arrived, then were promptly shown to our room. In the Victorian house, we had high, lofted ceilings and very traditional decor, though the lighting did feel a bit dim. The bathroom was definitely built into the corner of the room, and it was a bit awkward wedged in but functioned just fine.

For breakfast, they had a standard continental buffet and had a few options for hot meals. Breakfast was delicious as well, and we had a brief but very comfortable stay.",5,2016,07,10
216,Perfect base for exploring Dublin,"Imagine arriving EARLY after a transatlantic flight and being offered the most delicious breakfast ever, even before your first night's stay.  That's typical of the hospitality and helpfulness at Number 31.  Somewhat funky decor and an architectural pedigree make it a fun alternative to big hotels. It's easy walking distance to both local restaurants and tourist attractions. Trinity College (Book of Kells), the national museums, St Stephens Green, Georgian doors, shopping on Grafton Street, the city tour buses -- all close as can be. We're so glad we stayed here.",5,2016,07,09
216,Lovely family run boutique hotel,Lovely family run boutique hotel with super friendly hosts in a great location. The rooms in the old manor house are extremely comfortable and very well appointed. Both house and garden are beautiful. Enjoyed the great breakfast in the conservatory and the walking distance to many sights.,5,2016,07,07
216,"Luxury, family orientated hotel! ","Really lovely hotel! Travelled to Dublin with my mum to go to a concert, so booked a two night stay at this hotel. Was so impressed - hotel staff were very attentive and polite. Breakfast included in the price was a great deal, and had a wide selection which incorporated local produce to regularly be used. Wifi was always working - the room was very spacious and had a wonderful view of the outside garden. Tea and cake would be served whenever you'd like in the afternoon which was so lovely, to sip your tea and to sit alongside the wood burning fire. Such a warm and friendly establishment, had a great stay and would really recommend it for a city break for couples/groups or family. Town centre was around a 10-15 minute walk from the hotel and we had our own front door entrance, no 29 :) ",5,2016,07,06
216,Great Hotel - Great Breakfast - Lovely Staff,"Fantastic hotel, that has lovely rooms (albeit they are a little dark) - just oepn the blinds

Breakfast was simply fantastic, with multiple choices.

Staff were frienldy engaging and fun.

Would stay here again in a heart beat.",5,2016,07,04
216,Conveniently located quiet hotel with exceptional breakfast,"We stayed in a room on the top floor of the old part of the hotel and it was very quiet. The hike up and down the stairs actually did us some good since we ate so well while we were in Dublin. Bed was very comfortable. Furnishings were nice. The only caveat/recommendation I would make to the owners would be to add more hooks in the bathroom to hang wet towels so that they don't have to replaced each day. 

Breakfasts are truly out of this world. Bread is baked fresh in their kitchen. Don't pass it up.

We loved our stay at this hotel and would definitely stay again.",4,2016,07,03
216,Georgian charm and vibrant hosts,"This is a return visit to this boutique hotel after six years and it is just as good as we remember it. We would never choose to stay anywhere else. This time we returned with our family. The rooms in the old manor house are extremely comfortable  and very well appointed. The high ceilings give an amazing feeling of space and opulence. The breakfasts, which are served in the coach house, are very generous and you are always receive a friendly greeting from Noel in the morning. The sunken lounge with its welcoming peat-burning fireplace is a great place to just relax in. The guest house is very well situated close to St. Stephens' Green and in walking distance to Grafton Street. Thanks for anther great stay!",5,2016,07,03

-	Stylish modernist mews house where the living room and dining/breakfast room are located.  The discreet entrance, as shown on the website, achieves that feeling of being both understated and noticed; the warm fire in the living room on a rainy June morning was a very nice touch.
-	Breakfast is a completely delicious, nurturing, nourishing, and uncompromising affair:  Beautiful indoor and outdoor seating areas, both with formal services including starched napkins; an abundance of choices from fresh fruits and yogurt, to truly cook-to-order main entrees served piping hot, and aromatic French press.
-	Bed, the other B of this B&B, is comfortable, with soft and fresh linens.
-	The host and Linda are very warm, but I saw them only at breakfast.
-	Small but lovely garden.
Minuses:
-	I had booked a “Superior” room which, according to the website, should be in the Georgian house with its own sitting area, marble (decorative) fireplace, high ceiling, etc.  Instead, I was shown to a room in the mews house, sans fireplace, sitting area, or high ceiling.  When I asked about this discrepancy on the first evening, I was told that in fact, the “superior” rooms could be in either house.  When I mentioned that the website did not say that, I was told that indeed they “really” should modify their website.  When I asked if there was anything they could do to reconcile this gap, I was told to wait until the next morning to see what the host could do  --at which time I was told that it was really to my best interest to stay where I was , even though I was never shown what the rooms in the Georgian house looked like to decide for myself.  I liked my room in the mews house fine, but I also did not care to prolong this back-and-forth.  I just had a funny feeling that things were less than straightforward.  Oh, I was charged the rate of a “superior” room.
-	The shower was indeed extremely small.  I am petite (size 4), and I could barely turn around or walk out of the shower without hitting something.  I don’t know how someone of even an average size could deal with this.
-	The sunken living room is very interesting to look at, but not terribly comfortable to sit in.
-       The area surrounding the b&b seems very nice and well-kept, but except for a Starbucks across the street, there are mostly apartments/townhouses and offices nearby.  The nearest area with shops and restaurants (all casual except for Restaurant Dax) is about 10 - 15 minutes away on foot. This is not necessarily a minus, but it's just for awareness, for those who prefer to just stroll and drop in somewhere casually for lunch or dinner.

In all, despite all of the pluses which I appreciated very much, I am not sure that I would go back, mostly because of that nagging feeling of being misled without any genuine attempt to resolve.  If someone wants a room in the Georgian house, make sure to ask specifically.",4,2016,06,26
216,"Welcoming, lovely, fun boutique hotel","The service at Number 31 is outstanding - people who take great pride in their hotel and the services they provide and really care about making visitors feel welcome. The place has a very relaxing feel. The lobby is very nice (looks just like the picture) and the small courtyard is just beautiful.  The breakfast dining area is also very attractive (all glass) and the food was great.  A nice selection of cold food and made to order eggs, potatoes, breakfast meats etc. I imagine each room is different in size and decor.  Ours had a queen bed (my husband thought it very comfortable.  I slept fine though would have preferred firmer), night stands, dresser and wardrobe and a great big window which opened up to a fire escape landing and view of the courtyard. The room had dark paint and heavy curtains (good for keeping out light but not cheerful).  The pillows were too thin and flat. The bathroom was modern and a nice big size though no shelves or cabinets for storing anything. Lots of hot water and good pressure.  Right when you walk in, next to the bathroom, before entering the bedroom there was a little ""foyer"" which was nice place to leave our shoes and umbrellas.  We really enjoyed our stay there - the whole experience was very pleasant and happy.  It  was an easy 15 minute walk to the Ha'penny bridge. I would not hesitate to return or recommend this place to friends. It is difficult to find as others mentioned as the entrance is off a very small street.",4,2016,06,20
216,Rooms need bringing up to date,"I agree, some things are good: Noel, Linda, the breakfasts and the sunken lounge.

I stayed in the old house at the back.

However, they could spend some money to update and modernise things, considering how much they charge. The TV in each room was tiny and old, the shower cubicle was the smallest I've ever encountered, and the washroom in the reception area has a cracked toilet seat!! It was very unsightly and quite disgusting. The towels are thin, old and felt cheap.

Some things are inconsistent. I checked in during the afternoon and was not offered tea or coffees on arrival. I noted that the fire in the fireplace had gone out and all the tea lights around the place had gone out. The reception/lounge area felt dead and unloved.

This was different to what the lounge area could be like in the mornings (I was there for 3), with a fresh fire and tea lights. I suggest that they pay attention to keeping the place looking nice and inviting during the whole day.

I won't stay here again. The tiny shower cubicle and the even smaller TV made me feel like I was staying in a glorified hostel room. The towels are probably hostel quality.",2,2016,06,20
216,Beautiful hotel with wonderful service!,"We arrived in Dublin on a very early flight from the US. Upon locating the hotel and straightening out the parking situation (they were repaving just outside the parking lot which made our arrival slightly confusing but easily rectified by hosts) we were welcomed very warmly by Linda. She took us straight to the dining room to enjoy the most beautiful breakfast. In fact, this was the best breakfast we had during our entire stay in Ireland! Homemade breads (cranberry loaf is to die for!), delicious juice and coffee (latter the best my husband has had in his life) and amazing main course. Eggs Benedict are not only beautiful but so tasty and the omelet is perfectly done. We then got a rundown of the best route of the sites we wanted to visit (Book of Kells, etc) from Noel and were escorted to our room. We were in room 31 in the Georgian house which was small but beautiful and all that we needed (no need for a big room for just the two of us). The hotel itself is beautiful with all sorts of interesting details though the absolute highlights to me were the sunken reception area and the courtyard. We got through our sites and came back for a short nap which was very pleasant. Yes you do hear street noise but we were both able to sleep very well (could have been the sheer exhaustion) despite having the window open. Location is very convenient to areas that tourists would want to visit- easily walking distance. Breakfast the next morning was equally as delicious and our checkout process was very smooth. Linda and Noel were great hosts and we would definitely choose to stay here again!",5,2016,06,19
216,An excellent choice if looking for a boutique hotel,"We really enjoyed our stay at Number 31.  What we liked about it?  Laid back, quirky, really friendly hosts, great service, a cool sunken living room where we were served tea, a yummy full Irish breakfast.  What we didn't like?  Our room -- which was on the second floor, right at the top of the stairs by the front entrance -- was uncomfortably hot even with both windows open.  In addition, the bathroom was tiny -- some people may not be able to squeeze past the sink to get to the shower.  Despite this, we really enjoyed the place and I would have given it a 5 rating if not for our room drawbacks.",4,2016,06,17
216,Just ok! ,"We arrived and it was difficult to find- we called the host and he helped us which was great and carried our bags! Great! First off the architecture was unreal and amazing but I would have liked the host to discuss it more with us on our arrival- it was the reason we came to the guesthouse in the first place but it was never really addressed. A few things were pointed out like the 'office' (is this reception???) turns out this is where you check out too- a bit weird! We also expected welcome tea and cookies as per the booking but these never materialised. We were shown to our room which was nice but very masculine and dark. The Georgian flooring and coving is amazing but needs some upkeep, tiles were loose in the hall and the host never really made reference to the features which was disappointing. It was the worst nights sleep ever- the road noise I can cope with but we were right next to the front door and every time someone opened the door we woke up- I don't think you can charge 270 euros for a deluxe room when there is no chance of sleeping through the night. People returning at all hours and the walls are extremely thin. I appreciate in Georgian buildings there is little to do on this point but earplugs or even a little advanced warning/reduced rate for this room wouldn't go amiss. The bathroom was ok but the shower leaks onto the floor unless you shower at an obscene angle and the toiletries were all Scotland 'made in Scotland'- would have hoped somewhere boutique would be celebrating local produce. The furniture in the room was also a little disjointed- Georgian style bed, 70's chic Italian chair and 90's veneer wardrobe and drawers (which were blocking the beautiful fire place). No batteries in the television remote either! After a sleepless night I was looking forward to the award winning breakfast. The fruit selection is great and the home made bread was to die for. Would be nice to be able to buy a little picnic selection for your onward journey- just a thought for the hosts! My husband had the eggs Benedict and said it was delicious, I had a full Irish but I couldn't eat it as the eggs were swimming in too much grease, the potato cake was also a bit odd- tasted like leftover mashed potato with excessive amounts of dried rosemary!  The waiter did offer to change it but by this point I was tired and fed up and just wanted to leave. (Not helped by the communal breakfast table situation) 270 euros for no sleep and no breakfast! It's such a shame as I had read great reviews and was looking forward to staying somewhere quirky. The location is great and if you like the ideal of staying in a commune then this place will go down a treat. The hosts really don't make the most of what they've got in the architecture and the history of the building and the price tag doesn't match the quality. Won't be back. ",2,2016,06,17
216,Perfect Small Hotel in Dublin,"We arrived at the hotel at 9:30am after an all night flight from the U.S.  We anticipated that we would drop off our luggage off and bump around Dublin until we were able to check-in in the afternoon.  We were greeted at the front door by Noel, the host, who ushered us in and made us feel very welcome.  He then took us upstairs to the dining area where we were treated to a fabulous full Irish breakfast.  What a welcoming surprise!  We had the pleasure of enjoying this breakfast for the next 2 mornings during our stay at the hotel, and yes, it is probably one of the best Irish breakfasts in Dublin.  (The cranberry bread is wonderful).  After breakfast we waited briefly in the cozy reception area while they prepared our room.  The room was small with a nice terrace, but completely adequate, with a very nice ensuite bath.  The hotel is in a quiet neighborhood and was perfect for our stay in Dublin, as it was an easy walk to most of the major attractions, pubs, and restaurants.  I highly recommend this quaint, small, friendly hotel.  Noel and the staff were fantastic!",5,2016,06,08
216,Perfectly delightful ,"Our three night stay was a very good stay. It's location is near a lot of sites, but not on busy thru streets. The breakfast menu was broad enough to provide many good selections, especially for multi day stays. It was fresh and very well prepared.

The staff was very attentive, friendly and helpful. 

The common areas are quite nice and if the weather is good, the courtyard between the main entrance, which is the former coach house, and the accommodations located across the courtyard, is a very pleasant location to take coffee or tea. The accommodation building also fronts on the next street and its front door, though secured, is convenient for guest access.

A great treat!",5,2016,06,05
216,Lovely place with attentive hosts,"A nice room in a lovely Georgian house near the center of Dublin. A very personal atmosphere, and they serve a great breakfast! The hosts were wonderful: we stupidly left our rental car in a parking lot that was closed over the weekend, but they managed to get this problem sorted in no time. Thanks again! ",5,2016,05,29
216,Warm and welcoming small hotel/b&b in a great location,"Number 31 is a great home away from home; and they serve the best breakfasts ever!  We arrived from NYC and were given a hit breakfast while our rooms were prepared. The location off St Stephen's Green is great too. 
Lots of nice pubs near the canal walk.",5,2016,05,25
216,Rustic Modern Retreat,"Cool space in the city!  Only a 5 minute walk to St Stephens Green and 10 mins to Grafton St shopping.  Close to everything, but far enough away to be a quiet refuge.  The center garden space is so tranquil, spent a little time petting the two kitties on premises, the reception area, complete with sunken lounge sofa, is so relaxing sitting by the peat fireplace, our room was modern with a rustic touch overlooking the gardens.  To escape the hectic parts of Dublin, we had dinner each night at a few of the restaurants close to the hotel and all were wonderful!!!  Farm, The Sussex and Bank Cafe.  I would recommend not attempting to find the hotel on your own, take a cab....the door is hidden in an alley and we drove around in circles for and hour and a half until we finally accepted defeat, returned the car to the rental place and took a taxi!  You definitely do not need a car in Dublin so don't waste your time...you can walk to most everything and the bus system in the city is amazingly easy.  Breakfast each morning was just wonderful, the staff is so nice and very accommodating.  We had an early flight out and they made sure we had a good meal in us for our long day.  Can't say enough good things about Number 31....we just loved it!!!",5,2016,05,22
216,Disappointing room in news house ,"I was disappointed to be again given one of the rooms in the news house which are small, low ceilings and lacking in light. Moreover they charge the full rate -280 euros for one night!  If you stay in one of the famous Dublin Georgina houses you do expect to be in a Georgian house, not a 1980's extension at the end of the garden. Make sure you stipulate a room in the main house. ",3,2016,05,22
216,Amazing house,"This guest house is the perfect place to stay in Dublin! Great location, walking distance to all the good things you want to do. Service, everyone at the house is incredible, extremly helpful. Breakfast, you can't ask for anything better, fresh fruit, fresh OJ and food made as soon you order. Perfect for holiday, business or what ever you're planning avtrip to Dublin. Classic Deco, original sunken lounge and other great things part of the house..",5,2016,05,18
216,A very warm welcome ,"My husband treated me to a long weekend in Dublin for my birthday in April. After an early start traveling we arrived tired and hungry. We were greeted with enthusiasm, our cases were taken and we were whisked upstairs for a complimentary breakfast. There were cereals, fruit yoghurt and homemade cake to choose from. Also various cooked options. We were given an upgrade to our room as it was my birthday which was very generous and as it was ready early we were able to check in straight away. I would definitely recommend No 31 as it offers a more personal stay ",5,2016,05,17
216,Excellent stay in the St. Stephen's Green area,"It's the personal touches that make this a special place.  After an overnight flight from Toronto it was so nice to by ushered into Number 31 by Noel.  Ever so cheery and kind.  ""Step right in, leave your bags.  How about a lovely breakfast and coffee to ease the jet lag away.""  As others have mentioned the breakfasts are varied, plentiful and delicious. It's so nice to stay somewhere that is truly dedicated to helping you enjoy your stay with them and in Dublin.  Noel will help you plan you days given your time in town and arrange cabs, book restaurants and anything else to help you enjoy your stay.  The rooms are very comfortable with nice beds and quite quiet. An easy walk to almost everywhere you want to go as a tourist in Dublin.  Many excellent restaurants and pubs nearby. Route 700 on Aircoach's service from Dublin Airport to Lower Leeson St. stop will leave you with a 5 minute walk to Number 31.  (Across the street from the Starbucks!)
Definitely ask about the history of the building; it is a great story.",5,2016,05,17
216,Refuge! 😺,"This was an excellent place. Number 31 became our home for two weeks and it was a real refuge from the bump and grind of downtown Dublin. 
The breakfasts were wonderful and we spent several evenings winding down in the common area - reading and writing notes home while we had tea and cookies served up by one of the many folks we could always rely on to be around. 
We sat, many times, in the garden and enjoyed the sun and cats while planning out the afternoon and evenings ahead. A wonderful place we are sure to return to. ",5,2016,05,12
216,Special plance to stay,"What a great find! We arrived early and in fairness knew we would not be able to check in, however what we didn't expect was to be offered a delicious breakfast, and made to feel as welcome as we were. The rooms are beautifully decorated and the beds comfortable. 
Number 31 is in a super location, walking distance to the city centre and many superb restaurants. 
One of the outstanding points of this boutique hotel is contributed by Noel, the owner. He is warm and open and makes everyone feel special. Nothing is too much trouble and time is endless. A lovely attribute.",5,2016,05,07
216,City centre break,Location wide this place is great. The funky use of the two buildings works really well and we had a lovely stay. We were in a rush to get to an event so by the time we got to the hotel we had to dash out again so really only got to experience it the next morning. Breakfast is good and plentiful. Didn't give five stars as its more of a B&B than a hotel. Staff were lovely and helped with parking which is limited. ,4,2016,05,02
216,"Great location, Amazing breakfast!","We stayed here while on honeymoon in Ireland.

We were pleased to find out that its very close to the bus stop that takes you to and from the airport. We just had to walk 10 minutes from the bus stop, but it saves you from having to pay for a taxi!

The owner greeted us with tea and the most delicious homemade tea cake I've ever had. We were severely jet lagged so this was nice. We were also given a map with some suggestions of places to go. This ended up to be super helpful. 

Every breakfast we had there was SO good. They had a spread of muesli, compotes, fresh fruit, cereal, yogurt, toast, more of the awesome tea cake and Ireland's classic brown bread. Then, you could order from the hot breakfast options. We did not get hungry again until 7pm.",5,2016,04,25
216,Lovely Bed & Breakfast in Dublin!,"I stayed at Number 31 for a weekend visit and found the accommodations to be very comfortable. Breakfast is was amazing (I may never eat Eggs Benedict again)! The location is very convenient and close walk to all of the sites and the neighborhood is lovely. My room was perfect for a single traveler, it was clean, and quiet. I wish I would have had more time to enjoy the lovely garden. Thanks to Noel and Deirdre for making my stay so lovely.",5,2016,04,22
216,Nice hotel close to city center,"A Georgian house that is the Hotel in town, with a friendly and professional staff. Breakfast is top level.Some improvements are needed for the modern shower too ""architectual designed"" but with no water dropping... It is a very nice and friendly hotel",3,2016,04,21
216,Lovely stay,"We spent a long weekend in this lovely Bed and Breakfast. We were surprised by the beautiful decoration, great location and amazing breakfast. The neighborhood is quiet and at 15 minutes walking distance from the city center. Highly recommendable.",5,2016,04,20
216,Wonderful,"We arrived early in the morning after an overnight flight, to be greeted by our extremely warm host, Noel. Noel immediately ushered us into their beautiful glass enclosed dining room to join the other guests for the outstanding breakfast we heard so much about.  It lived up to its praise.  
Number 31 is an oasis in Dublin, hidden in a little side street. The rooms are spacious, the showers divine, and the communal spaces including a sunken couch are just wonderful.  Most importantly, the owners, Noel and Linda and their staff are so are extremely warm and inviting, you feel like your staying with friends rather than at a hotel.
The only thing to note is that it's about a 15-25 minute (albeit lovely) walk to most of the sights of Dublin such as Grafton Street or Temple Bar so you sacrifice convenience for all the loveliness Number 31 has to offer.",5,2016,04,09
216,We had a really lovely stay,"A lovely, characterful hotel run by a very welcoming, charming and hospitable couple.  The staff were really helpful and nothing seemed too much trouble.  We had a room in the older part of the property at the front on the ground floor.  It was spacious and clean, the bed was comfortable, the bathroom was good with plentiful nice toiletries. I would have given a 5 star review, but the room was incredibly dark. There was lighting, but it was very dim.  There were bedside lights, but trying to read a book in bed was difficult.  Breakfast was amazing.  Lots of fresh healthy choices beautifully displayed and an excellent choice of cooked breakfast.  The breakfast room and conservatory are light and airy, a pleasure to eat in.  The sunken lounge with blazing open fire was very comfortable.  Complimentary tea with homemade cake was most welcome.  And when the sun came out we had tea in the charming little garden which was gorgeous.",4,2016,04,06
216,Lovely service but overpriced and needs some work,"We enjoyed our stay, and the breakfast and hospitality were fantastic. The room we had was disappointing though - the TV was old and clunky, the DVD cable was missing for the player, the door handle covering inside was coming off, the WIFI was too weak to be useful, and it was very small. Not big inconveniences given we were out most of the time, but 421 Euros for 2 nights is a lot of money, and I think it was very overpriced at that rate. I think it needs a spruce up to bring the service and breakfast up to the same level as the service.",3,2016,04,04
216,Still great,Amazing breakfast. Warm & friendly host and excellent location were good reasons to return and we are very happy that we did. Weather was gloomy but that did not stop the cheered staff. Arrived early in the morning from USA and was gives a great breakfast and by the time we had eaten our room was ready.,5,2016,03,29
216,Terrific ,"We stayed at 31 with all my family for St Patrick's day, Noel the owner made us all feel welcome and made our stay at 31 a weekend to remember. If your lucky he might even sing you a tune at breakfast! Fantastic breakfast and friendly staff. Location is also great. Will come again. 
",5,2016,03,29
216,Nice breakfast but over priced,"This B&B is nicely furnished and our room seemed to have been painted recently. However the rooms lack decent Wifi and have no tea making facilities. Furniture starting to look aged.

Breakfast is lovely, freshly made with plenty of choice. Sit at communal tables but they are big enough to have your own privacy. 

My main concern is the price. For what we paid, you would expect near perfection from a B&B and we didn't get that. Knock €50-75 off the price per night and then I can understand people's 4 and 5 star ratings. 

Overall good but expect a little more for that price.",3,2016,03,28
216,Can't imagine visiting Dublin and staying anywhere else,"Number 31 was more than just a nice place to stay while visiting Dublin... it was an intrinsic and highly enjoyable part of our Dublin experience.  I can't imagine going back to Dublin and staying anywhere else. 

The people were wonderful, from the owner Noel and the manager Linda, to literally every single staff member we encountered.  Traveling internationally with teenagers, as we were doing, is hard enough, and, at every step of our journey, the staff at Number 31 was looking for little (and big!) ways to take the rough edges off of our trip.  The experience that Noel and his staff have created truly exemplifies Irish hospitality.

I'm a design enthusiast, and appreciated the attention to aesthetics.  There were interesting and inviting spaces around every corner.  The property strikes a difficult-to-achieve balance between feeling both quintessentially Dublin and thoroughly modern at the same time.

The neighborhood is perfect.  St. Stephen's Green and central Dublin are a short walk, but the property is close to the lovely, more residential neighborhood near the Canal, and a world apart from the awful touristy-ness of Temple Bar.  Linda recommended several excellent restaurants in the immediate vicinity (The Farm, the Canal Bank Cafe)... I wish we had time to visit every restaurant on her list (although we did go to the Farm twice!).

A few practical tips: 1) modern design enthusiasts may want to request a room in the main building... those looking for more space will want the Georgian property, 2) the property offers excellent value... the value of the breakfast absolutely can not be underestimated (they call it ""probably the best in Dublin,"" but, as far as I'm concerned, it's probably the best in the world!), 3) visit the neighborhood restaurants, as opposed to heading into central Dublin.  

Thanks to Number 31 for taking such good care of us.  We'll be recommending this property to our friends in Washington, DC, and can't wait to get back to visit our new Irish friends again!",5,2016,03,27
216,Perfect balance of service and location (+ great breakfast!),We had an amazing stay at Number 31 - wish we had been there more than two nights. Location was a short walk from all of the attractions in Dublin and service was perfect! The breakfast included in the room rate was amazing - great way to start the day.,5,2016,03,06
216,Wonderful stay!,"This B&B is perfectly located - walking distance to St. Stephen's Green, Temple Bar, National Concert Hall and more.  The owners and staff are all warm, friendly and accommodating to ensure a comfortable stay.  The B&B is divided into two buildings - the carriage house and a Georgian townhouse, with the common sitting area and breakfast area in the carriage house and rooms in the townhouse.  Our room, #22 on the first floor of the townhouse,  was large with a decorative fireplace, lounge chair and 2 wing chairs.  Really comfortable space with plenty of storage for clothes and a super comfy king bed.  The bathroom was spacious and had a large shower.  
Breakfast at Number 31 is special - a substantial choice of hot breakfasts plus breads, cakes, toast, yoghurt, fresh and stewed fruits, berries, meusli, granola and cereal.  Great french-press coffee and juice too!  Breakfast here was enough to carry us through to dinner.  Would definitely stay here again.",5,2016,03,01
216,Amazing place,"Quiet place in Dublin, 15min by foot from the center. Hosts are very welcoming and rooms are nice and sophisticated. 
Good points : place, room, design, breakfast (amazing), welcome from guests...
Only one bad point, for a French girl because obviously it is common in Ireland, there is not enough heating in the bathroom.",5,2016,02,17
216,"Perfect Location, Stylish and Large Georgian Rooms and a most convivial host","My wife and I chose Number 31 for the base of my birthday weekend in Dublin. We chose the hotel for its location in the Georgian Centre of Dublin and its proximity to most of the main attractions in Dublin City Centre.

Upon arriving early, Noel the host immediately made us feel welcome and we were whisked off for breakfast with an offer of the ""full Irish"". On a map Noel made time to explain all the key Dublin attractions and locations of recommended bars/restaurants. All very useful information and we used the map to navigate the whole city on foot for the weekend.

The hotel is very stylish Georgian property with huge rooms, high ceilings and a large walk-in shower. The breakfast area is in the mews house at the back across the garden. This is a modern, light and airy communal dining area serving a great selection of cooked breakfasts. The hotels' claim of having the best ""full Irish breakfast"" in Dublin is a very real one - its recommended and sets you up for a day of walking the streets of Dublin. We will definitely be back to Number 31 for the Dublin part on our next trip for a more extended holiday across the whole of the Emerald Isle.",5,2016,02,17
216,Quirky hotel with warm family welcome,"This was a great find, tucked away just of Leeson Street and close to St Stephen's Green. Loved everything about the place except the room didn't really live up to expectations based on the website gallery and the price. The bedroom was cramped, the bathroom more so. It was also dark, oppressively hot, and in need of some TLC. Great breakfast though from the friendly, welcoming hosts. Overall, a lovely stay, but not particularly good value.",3,2016,02,16
216,Terrific Spot!,"On my third trip to Dublin, stayed here June 2015 with family group.  Noel and all the staff treated us with such care from the moment we walked in through check out.  After our warm welcome, a staff member heard we were returning our rental car and took the time to lead us to the return spot on her way home from work!  We had the family room (very spacious) and a second room, both updated and comfortable.  Under the watchful eye of Noel, we had a terrific breakfast the first morning and then he actually offered us a third room at no cost to better accommodate our group.  When we returned back to Number 31 after long days sightseeing around Dublin the staff gave us outstanding local restaurant recommendations within walking distance.  I can't say enough about this hidden gem.  On my recommendation my brother-in-law will be visiting Number 31 in June this year.  If you've already tried the highly priced more commercially known Dublin hotels you must try Number 31 - it will be your new go-to spot.",5,2016,02,15
216,A marvellous Irish welcome in a historic town house... What a find!!,Noel and all the staff made us very welcome from the moment we arrived by providing an unexpected cooked breakfast on our arrival from the airport... The first of a number of superb breakfasts. The house and its fascinating architecture is worth a visit in itself. Our room could not have been more elegant.  Brilliant location close to St Stephens Green. On our departure we were offered free use of our room as we had a late flight. A truly pleasurable experience and we look forward to returning.,5,2016,02,12
216,Charming,"I loved this hotel. I loved the fact that half the rooms are in a Georgian townhouse and the other half in the converted coachhouse – now a modernist mews house designed by architect Sam Stephenson. 
The courtyard garden, in between the two houses, is just beautiful. Would loved to have stayed longer. Amazing breakfast too.",5,2016,01,31
216,Something nice and different to a Hotel,"Stayed here based on the reviews on TripAdvisor. Breakfast is really really good, like having your mother cook for you! The house is really nice decor wise, slightly strange the setup of the place but that is just because i'd be more familiar with hotels. Location is fantastic and a great place to stay for people visiting the city. The owners seemed to know a few of the guests on a personal level and got the feeling people are really well looked after wherever they can be.",4,2016,01,25
216,Style; no substance. Spend your money on a 5* hotel.,"I wish I'd read the other poor/ terrible reviews before I booked this... They're bang on. It looks lovely in photos but its awful value for money. No sign of the luxury, service, quality or privacy you expect for that price. I'm shocked they can get away with this.
No sound insulation = bad sleep and complete lack of privacy (do not go for a romantic break). Terrible customer service = I tried to engage with them by email twice after our stay but they failed to reply to my queries. Tattered sofa cushions, dirty paintwork = definitely not 5*. Strange atmosphere = surely the atmosphere is the most important thing!? No kettle in room = just weird - there's a reason every other hotel has one!

Bought a night there as a Christmas gift to my girlfriend. I was so embarrassed by how bad our stay was I had to retract the gift. I wished we'd just stayed in one of the 5* hotels.",1,2016,01,23
216,Wonderful and Most Highly Recommended!,"We loved absolutely everything about our stay at Number 31. The property is stunning -- the location is fantastic -- the rooms are very comfortable and well appointed -- the staff is lovely -- Noel is a masterful host -- and the breakfast, oh my, the breakfast is perfection! We can't wait to come back.",5,2016,01,19
216,"Comfortable, quirky and well located.","Number 31 is a great place to stay. Our room was on the top floor of the lovely Georgian building - lots of stairs ! - so do request help with suitcases. The room was spacious, very clean and comfortable.
All the staff are very friendly and helpful. On arrival we were given a map of the city with places of interest, restaurants etc marked.
Breakfasts were excellent. A wide selection of fresh fruit, home made soda bread and cake and superb cooked items ( portions are generous). The hosts are brilliant and offer a wealth of local knowledge.
Highly recommended",5,2016,01,16
216,A warm welcome in Dublin,"My wife and I recently spent 5 nights here. Not only were the breakfasts among the best I've ever had, and thoroughly deserving of their reputation, Noel provided a warm and informative welcome and was unbelievably kind to our son who was at university in Dublin. I have rarely experienced the kindness Noel provided my family. On top of this, the ""new"" part is an architectural triumph of the 60s-a rare thing- and the Georgian building next door is beautiful. A lovely 10 minute walk to the centre of town and close to many terrific pubs and restaurants.",5,2016,01,16
216,Great place to stay in the middle of Dublin,"Stayed here with friends over New Year and it was brilliant.
Situated in a lovely old Georgian house (but a bit of a climb to the top floor with suitcases if you are up there), nice room (but could do with a bit more lighting - as could so many hotel rooms these days!) but a truly great place to stay.
Situated within 10 minutes walk of the centre of Dublin.
The staff are excellent - the patron is quite a character and adds greatly to the enjoyment of one's stay.
The breakfasts are amazing (you don't need to eat for the rest of the day).
We were given advice on where to go and where to eat - all suggestions were first rate.
A great place to stay.",5,2016,01,15
216,Excellent breakfast,"Excellent breakfast when the order was got right! No worries, still superb. Our hosts and staff were charming. Our rooms were on the top floor, quite a trek, we were asked on our second day if we wished to move rooms. We declined, but it was thoughtful of them. The house is charming, very central. Our hosts gave us great restaurant referrals. Would recommend Number 31.",4,2016,01,06
216,Cosmopolitan comfort!,"This was my base while in Dublin for a week, and Linda, Noel and the entire staff, were A+++. The amazing breakfast, quiet  & restful setting whilst in the midst of Georgian Dublin combined with modern architecture made this lovely hotel a wonder for the senses.

Number 31 has the charm, the talent and the sparkle of the Irish, and I am ready to return!  Thank you for your knowledge of the city, the great restaurant and pub referrals.  Truly was well looked after.",5,2015,12,31
216,Best Breakfast In The World,"What can you say about the Breakfast, spot on... great chose and very well cooked and presented. I recommend the Full Traditional Irish Breakfast, also you get loads of toast and tea or coffee... Love People and a great place to stay...",5,2015,12,15
216,Cozy elegance,"Three of us (all women of a certain age) stayed here for a long weekend. I was somewhat nervous about sharing a room, but the one we were in (#21) easily accommodated us, with room to spare. The room was large and grandly painted. 

Breakfasts offered lots of choices, and everything was delicious.

The hosts couldn't have been more charming and accommodating.

I would definitely recommend Number 31!",5,2015,12,11
216,Quality place to stay,"Stayed here on recent trip to Dublin and we were not dissappointed. Room was spacious ,well appointed and comfortable. Breakfast was very good with great choices. Staff were really friendly and very helpful. Overall a really good place to stay even though at the upper end of the market.",4,2015,11,23
216,"Great Place, Great Breakfast ","We started our 8 days in Ireland at #31 and were very glad we did. It's an enchanting place hidden behind a wall with a warm and welcoming staff. They had tea and coffee ready by the fire in their sitting area. Our room was in the front, original building and was small but well appointed and comfortable, with a good size bathroom. Everything was clean and the layout of the two buildings with a yard between was excellent (at least in the sunny weather we were lucky enough to have!) But the real star of the show was the fantastic breakfasts, served in the sun room or an adjoining interior room, both very pretty. Location is a bit off the beaten path but we still walked most places. 
",5,2015,10,29
216,A mum and daughters weekend away,"A lovely comfortable and friendly b&b, the guest area is gorgeous with a sunken and comfortable lounging seating area,tea and cake was served on arrival, the rooms are comfortable, breakfast is delicious. The location is walking distance for Dublin centre, restaurant, bars and sightseeing.",5,2015,10,25
216,Absolutely wonderful!,"We were recommended to stay here and so happy we did!! The staff is fantastic  and just as charming as the rooms. The room are spacious  and completely gorgeous! Their high ceilings make the rooms feel completely grand!  There is also a charming courtyard garden area, it was a tad cold on our stay, but would have been a lovely spot to relax or catch up on emails! 

Breakfast, which is included, was way more than expected. Granola a, fruits and cereals were set up in a beautiful display. Then they take your order and make you just about whatever you like!! So yummy. 

There is a beautiful park with a playground a few blocks away, and a few restaurants that are also superb just 2-3 mins walk. 

I would highly recommend this to anyone traveling to Dublin! 
",5,2015,10,24
216,Favorite property of 5 stayed in across Ireland!  Would stay again.,"We stayed for 2 nights on recommendations from friends.  We were in the back building and had a very large room with a King bed.  The bed was comfortable and the amenities were all as expected for the price.  It feels more like an inn or hotel than a true B&B, though the service from Sam was very personal and the breakfast was one of the best we had.  Sam helped to thoroughly review a map of Dublin attractions, restaurants and pub with us that helped shaped our time in the city.  Our only 'complaint', which is minor, is that the shower was only a 1/2 door, so when we used it water tended to run out the back and wet the floor in the bathroom.  In walking distance to nearly all the major attractions!",5,2015,10,23
216,Wow what an incredible find!!!,"I stayed here a few weeks ago for one with my parents in the family suite. What an amazing place!! I only wish we stayed longer. Our suite had a king and 2 singles, all beds were incredibly comfortable and the linens were great. We arrived on a red eye flight from Canada and were greeted at Number 31 with a warm smile, hot tea and coffee and delicious loaf bread. Our bags were brought to our rooms and our early check in was not a problem at all. The breakfast the next day.... Wow. Fresh OJ, French pressed coffee, full tables of fresh fruit, granola and yogurt. I had the Irish breakfast, while my parents had the Benedict and smoked salmon scrambled eggs. No details were spared! My only complaint would be the suite toilets.. The toilets did not flush well and there was no fans so after showers were a bit steamy! Although there was a heated towel rack.. Awesome!! Can't wait for my next trip to Dublin, will definitely stay at Number 31!!!",5,2015,10,17
216,Great place to stay in Dublin,"Our room was lovely, walking distance to all attractions.  Noel and Sam were very friendly and helpful.  We had the best breakfast. I only wish we had found out about this beforehand....so friendly. There is a lovely lounge to sit in.  The rooms are large, the bed very comfortable..",5,2015,10,15
216,"Nice, but overpriced","We stayed three nights at No. 31. The owner and staff were fantastic - very friendly and accommodating. Breakfast was great. Our room in the Georgian house, while 4 floors up stairs, was very nice - clean and comfortable.

Had we stayed in the room we were initially booked into, our opinion would be very different. When booking I had requested a room in the Mews with a bit of private garden, thinking it would be nice to have some private space after being in busy Dublin all day. The room we were shown on the ground floor of the Mews was awful - dark, damp, musty and small. It had sliding doors to a very small bit of terrace but we would not have been able to keep them open because of the strong smell of cat pee in the garden. Apparently two cats were abandoned and the B&B took them in. The cats are sweet, however they should be neutered so as to stop spraying (and so as to not make more kittens that will be abandoned!). Had we not been able to move rooms, we would have left.

The common area with the sunken seating area is generally in need of refurbishing. The leather sofa cushions are torn and too soft from wear. The rugs are ragged and need replacing. This area is not shabby chic, it is, really, just shabby. And, the peat fire, while initially nice, produces a lot of smoke; so much so that I feel that it is an unhealthy work space for the staff.

Overall, I would not stay again. No. 31 is billed as a boutique guesthouse. If the cat pee smell were less, and the common area upgraded, it would live up to its billing. As it is now, €220 per night is too much. In any event, the ground floor Mews room should cost less.",4,2015,10,13
216,Good experience overall,"I like funky B&B's (although this felt more like an inn to me since it was spread over two properties sharing a courtyard), and, after reading glowing reviews, we decided that the price, although a little more than comparable properties, would be a good investment because we were traveling with a car and parking was in their own little lot and included with the price of the room.  

Upon arrival at around 10am, we were greeted with coffee and soda bread and asked to wait a few minutes in a living-room type lobby area (with a peat fire) while an employee took our bags to our room and made sure it was ready.  This was lovely after traveling for 12+ hours overnight and the always stressful experience of the first drive in a new country.  He returned after about 15 minutes, helped us get our bearings in the area, and showed us to our room, although it was still much too early for standard check-in.

The hosts were warm, the breakfast was plentiful and first-rate, and the location was good.  I give it a “good” rather than a “great” mainly because, although the area looks residential, it actually seems to be more of a business district.  It was really quiet on the weekend.  (Depending on your preference, that could be good or bad.)  Because of this, we typically ended up walking wherever we were going in the evening and taking a cab back.  There are only a few restaurants in the immediate vicinity, but there is a Starbuck's nearby on one side of the property that seemed to have long hours.  (Which worked for grabbing a quick mini-meal in a pinch.)
Like most older properties, Number 31 seems to be a constant work in progress.  (I feel like the handful of properties I've stayed at in Dublin over the years all fit this description to some degree.)  Some elements were definitely shabby, both in the public spaces and the rooms, but the bathroom was recently refurbished with high end materials.  I typically go for the smallest room possible, just because we don't need a lot of space, but I would suggest upgrading here.  Although the bathroom materials are very nice, the shower is tiny, which wouldn't have been a problem other than it's a rain head directly above you and there's no space to get out of the flow.  (It reminded me of showering in a very nice camper.)  I have contacts, so I was basically showering with my eyes closed, it made it difficult to use conditioner, etc.

All in all, I would definitely stay at Number 31 again, but I will probably look into other properties that could provide a little better value for money as well.  3.5 stars.",4,2015,10,09
216,Fabulous stay at Number 31,"Our stay at Number 31 was exceptional.  We had a lovely, comfortable room that was nice and quiet at night.  Each morning we enjoyed a varied delicious hot breakfast of our choice.  The Owner/Host, Noel, is a wonderful, charming man that welcomes all his guests with open arms.  Number 31 is centrally located in Dublin - we were able to get around easily by walking, bus, or train.",5,2015,10,07
216,Love this Inn,After a long flight I was very warmly welcomed and lead up for a wonderful breakfast. Breakfast is served in a very sunny room and there is a solarium to eat in as well. I waited a short time in the lovely court yard between the back of the two townhouses and shortly my room was ready. I greatly appreciated that.  I refreshed and headed out.  The rooms are well appointed.  The lobby is very retro. Great location with a quick wk to all the sights. The proprietor recommended a bistro nearby for dinner which was great. I highly recommend Number 31 without hesitation and will return on my next visit to Dublin.,5,2015,10,07
216,Return to an old Dublin favorite,"Our third trip to Dublin and Number 31.  Noel and his talented, friendly, and very helpful staff did their best to make this stay as wonderful and as memorable as were our previous visits.  The breakfast, hot and cold, are excellent and plentiful.  The rooms are comfortable, clean, modern and quiet.  The property has several rooms of varying sizes in the main modern house and others in a neighboring Georgian house on Fitzwilliam Street, so you may want to request your room type and location based upon your preference for older versus more modern accommodations.  The property is well and conveniently situated within easy and safe walking distance to St. Stephen's Green, Grafton Street, Temple Bar, Trinity College, and all the other sites that Dublin is famous for.  Noel is a fantastic, tireless host who goes out of his way to make his guests feel very welcome and happy.",5,2015,09,26
216,Shabby....,Stayed for 4 nights.  Staff was friendly and breakfast was good.  Rooms very small with poor lighting.  Rooms smelled musty and 'cat smell' was prevalent - even with a fan.  We left early due to having intoxicated person keep us up all night.  Walls are thin.  Way better places to stay for the money!,2,2015,09,16
216,Welcomed with a Full Irish breakfast,"We arrived from the airport after taking the red eye from the US.  Bleary eyed and tired, Noel opened the door, picked up our bags, walked us by the fireplace, and sent us directly upstairs for a beautiful breakfast.  This was just the beginning of a wonderful stay.  From discussing our Irish family names to our comfortable rooms, Noel and his family could not have been kinder.",5,2015,09,16
216,A quaint B&B near St. Stephen’s Green.,"A quaint B&B near St. Stephen’s Green, with a very helpful staff and a delicious breakfast.
The room was comfy with most of the expected amenities - Although the tv didn't work.
The bed was nice if a bit squeaky - In general the room was very nice but could us a bit of a shining up in order to match the general decoration of the b&b.

My room was up 3 or 4 flights of stairs which was fine for me, but if you have trouble with stairs it might be beneficial to request a room on a lower level.

The b&b is located a 10 min walk south of St. Stephen’s Green and is in a bit more of a quite area. This means that even during the weekend you are likely to have a quite night, but reaching or returning from the temple bar area at night will require a taxi.

Overall a good experience. And I would consider returning to no. 31 at a later date.",3,2015,09,16
216,Great quirky boutique stay,"A great antidote to the regular hotel, you enter through a back alley into what would have been the coach-house, now transformed into a reception and breakfast area. A short stroll through the garden takes you to the house (which was confusingly number 29). The rooms were great, well thought out and very comfortable, the only downside was noise from the traffic outside. Breakfast was excellent and lovely to stay with such welcoming hosts.",4,2015,09,16
216,"Great welcome, great location","Four ladies on a girls' birthday weekend, arrived late after plane delayed, lovely welcome. Rooms lovely (although a flat cap left behind a chair and lots of dust behind the bedhead found when I plugged in my phone charger suggested that cleaning could be a bit more thorough - but that's detail!) Breakfast out of this world, Noel greeted us with warm handshakes and kisses, the rest of the family also lovely. The courtyard is gorgeous, the building amazing, the toiletries, shower, everything just lovely. Stay here.",4,2015,09,13
216,Your Dublin home,"We have stayed in many hotels and guesthouses in many years of travel and without exaggeration, Noel, the proprietor of Number 31, is the most welcoming host we've ever encountered. We've just checked out after our second visit and had to write this review to thank Noel and his team for a wonderful stay. He made us feel very welcome and appreciated as he does every guest. And as other guests have commented in many reviews, the cooked breakfast is without comparison. Unique place, indeed. We will come back without any hesitation. Sylvie and Kevin",5,2015,09,13
216,"Warm welcome, Great Breakfast, Pretty setting",Wonderful stay with very helpful friendly team.  Special thanks to Adam for meals and places a little off the beaten track for music.  Terrific breakfast with a very warm welcome in the covered terrace.  Particularly loved the lounge area upon entering with its comfortable seating and wood burning fireplace where we were greeted with a pot of tea and biscuits.  Very pretty garden between the two buildings.  An imaginative blend of the historic and modern,5,2015,09,13
216,A Hard to Find Favorite - Spacious Room and a Garden Breakfast,"Hard to find...a little lane off a small road. Dont be discouraged because when you find it - it will be worth it!! Dont let the sunken living room and small entry fool you - this place is not mod or small although its quaint in many ways.  We stayed in a room in the Georgian home - Very large room, I could have done cartwheels in it. Must have been 12 foot ceilings with beautiful floor to ceiling velvet drapes, a fireplace, sitting area and small in proportion marble bathroom.  So if you like space and to spread out...book a room in this building. 
One of the most enjoyable breakfasts ever - prepared by the owners - to order in an atrium off the common garden. Simple , fresh, warm and friendly
you are only a 10-15 min walk from center of town. 
note - Sussex restaurant is around the corner - recommended by owner was one of our best meals in Ireland.
The hosts/owners we delightful - warm and welcoming did everything to make your stay comfortable.",5,2015,09,07
216,Wow,"We spent a couple of nights here to start a holiday in Ireland. What a treat! Lovely large simple and stylish room. Everything works, beds are lovely. Just like staying with a really good mate. Very relaxed. Interesting building too. 

Breakfast is incredible. We tried the full Irish, Eggs Benedict and lots of baked specialities. All sublime. 

Staff here are just lovely. Friendly and helpful. Chatty if you want it or discreet if you are not in the mood. Lots of advice we were given about exploring Dublin was spot on. restaurants recommended were lovely - Matt The Thresher and The Sussex - both walking distance, as is the rest of the City. 

Small amount of private parking available. Just parked and walked for two days. Ideal for exploring and eating/drinking! Thank you so much.  We shall be back.",5,2015,08,28
216,Back again with more family,"We love Number 31. This time I brought my sister and our neice. Noel is an excellent host, this time we met his equally welcoming daughter. Our welcome on arrival was the best. The breakfast is the best, a selection to suit everyone. I don't think there is anything that Noel and his wife haven't thought about. The rooms are comfortable. The hotel is a perfect location for sight seeing in Dublin and beyond, there are leaflets for  various day trips  to attractions that one can visit. We had a lovely time, thank you all so much, and we look forward to staying again",5,2015,08,28
216,Fantastic introduction to Ireland,"The hosts at Number 31 are the most welcoming people ever.   They greeted us with a traditional Irish breakfast (arguably the best in Ireland) and helped us plan our tourist visits.   Very clean, very classy and a perfect way to begin a holiday in Ireland.
Ps.   Best coffee I have ever had!
Laurence and Colleen Bather",5,2015,08,25
216,The best to stay in Dublin,"If you wnat to have a different experience in Dublin, you should stay in Number 31, a place that makes you feel you're at home. The owner, Noel, is fantastic, polite, and gives you many tips about what to do in Dublin. The apartments are beautifully decorated and the breakfast is unforgettable.",5,2015,08,16
216,"Personal, home-style touch near St. Stephen's Green","Where else in Dublin will you smell a peat fire burning on the hearth? Only at Number 31. And the breakfast is absolutely AMAZING...fresh brown bread, beautiful eggs Benedict prepared to order, garden-fresh tomatoes, and a warm Irish welcome. 
The rooms are beautiful...not Radisson Blu beautiful, but beauty with personality. We stayed in the Georgian part of the building, and would love to stay again.",5,2015,08,15
216,Wonderful stay!,"We had three nights in Dublin staying at Number 31 - our stay was delightful.  The owners and staff could not have been more welcoming, helpful, and pleasant.  The breakfast is to die for!  Would recommend getting a room away from the street if you like quiet.  Hotel is conveniently located close to St Stephens Green and within walking distance to all centre city sites and shopping.  We would definitelt stay here again.",5,2015,08,09
216,Outstanding hospitality and delightful breakfast!,"Such a wonderful place to stay in. The hospitality was unique. So friendly and definitely made us feel at home. 
The rooms were clean and nicely decorated. The Georgian building was so elegant. The garden connecting the two buildings was so serene. 
The breakfast was exquisite! loved the outdoor community table. 
Location is definitely walking distance to temple bar and all the nearest attractions and pubs. It's nice to walk through Saint Stephen's Green to get to our room.",5,2015,08,06
216,Still wonderful.......,"......after all our years of visits!  Apart from the location and the atmosphere, what makes this hotel what it is is the people,  And they all seem to get better, like fine wines, as the years go by!

As ever, thank you Noel, Linda, Delia and everyone for looking after us so well.",5,2015,08,05
216,High design B&B,"Half an interior design showcase and half a comfortable B&B this was our home for two days in Dublin. 
A little on the pricey side but the design elements, hospitality and breakfast were excellent. 
We had a room on the top floor but bags were taken up with no complaints (or guilty feelings). The building is 10 minutes walk from the main centre of Dublin so made an interesting change within the Georgian buildings. 
The breakfast were high quality, large and no doubt calorie laden.",5,2015,08,04
216,Amazing Hospitality & Location!,"Such a great place to stay in Dublin - cannot recommend highly enough.  Linda and the rest of the staff are Irish treasures welcoming us so warmly and treating us like long lost family the whole stay.  The location is amazing - close to all the Dublin sights, but safely away from the insanity of Temple Bar.  Linda even recommended some ""local"" pubs just down the way that were really great. Breakfast each morning was such a delight - choices of hot prepared dishes (and that famous cranberry bread) in a lovely sun-drenched loft.  Can't wait to visit again!",5,2015,08,04
216,"Quiet, convenient, great breakfast","High points for hospitality! We arrived a bit later than the normal breakfast hours, but the staff still welcomed us to the breakfast area for scrambled eggs and salmon. You can't go wrong with the Ireland travel books available in the sunken living room, combined with the friendly advice about sights and best bets for music and food. We walked to St. Stephens Green, Trinity College, Dublin Castle, the Jameson Distillery and Christ Church Cathedral with no trouble.",5,2015,08,02
216,Excellent guesthouse option for families,"Our family of four stayed at Number 31 for four nights and were very pleased with the room and service we received. The staff were super helpful from the moment we arrived (coffee & cookies in the lounge while the manager gave us an update on local restaurants, transportation & sightseeing options). The breakfasts each morning were also excellent with good cold and hot options. The family suite was very spacious even by American standards. Location-wise, Number 31 is within easy walking distances to central Dublin and the main tourist attractions. There are also a number of good restaurants and pubs nearby (The Sussex restaurant & pub is especially good).",5,2015,07,31
216,Delighted in Dublin!,"Was a short visit in Dublin and thoroughly charmed by Number 31.  On the first night, I had  room on the top floor - thank you to the staff for taking my bag upstairs!  With other rooms available the next night, I was able to move down to one of the larger rooms. Certainly had more space for the 3 days I was there, which I appreciated.  Attention to small details, the staff was welcoming from the moment of arrival.  Make sure you are hungry for breakfast... I would / will definitely recommend Number 31 and will stay there again without a doubt.",5,2015,07,29
216,personality +,"The sleep quality is excellent , Noel was a wonderful host and helped us with last minute travel and sleep plans for our road trip, 
Breakfast is delicious
The bathrooms we stayed in only had showers but the rooms were wonderfully spacious old and character filled",5,2015,07,24
216,Home away from home,"We are not quite finished with our stay in Dublin but nothing will change with our stay at Number 31.   There is no question that they have the best breakfast of any place we have ever stayed. Not only are there many choices for a cooked to order breakfast, but the quality of the preparation is top notch. Service is available any time with Noel the owner never far away overseeing very capable staff. Our room is spacious in an 1800's Georgian mansion and very comfortable.  The location is within easy walking distance to almost anywhere in Dublin and many excellent local restaurants. Our stay is for two weeks and we highly recommend Number 31 to anyone visting Dublin.",5,2015,07,18
216,Wonderful stay!,My friend and I were traveling and had to make last minute changes to our plans. We lucked into Number 31 and despite having reservations at another spot in Dublin decided to stay here for the totality of our stay. The breakfast was incredible but what truly made our stay was the incredible staff. They were kind and friendly - greeting us each morning and welcoming us at night. We felt looked after and relied on them for advice on must dos and must sees. They gave awesome recommendations and it was the places they suggested that we enjoyed most!  Without question we would return!,5,2015,07,15
216,Wonderful hotel.  I don't understand the bad reviews,"I have stayed in many hotels and I thought Number 31 was among the best.  Some reviewers complain that the hotel is a bit run down, but I did not notice that (and I tend to be picky).  Our room was beautiful and quiet overlooking a courtyard.

The staff is what really made this hotel special.  We arrived a bit after normal breakfast hours, but they went out of their way to provide us with something to eat.  Everyone we interacted with was extremely helpful and pleasant.  The included breakfast is excellent.

The location is an easy walk to almost everything in Dublin.

I thought it was a very good value for the price and would definitely recommend to anyone visiting Dublin.",5,2015,07,08
216,"They try so hard, and are lovely people, but the hotel needs help","I want to say first that the owners are enchanting people. Very welcoming, and they take every measure to make the stay special. The hotel is also in a very interesting area of the City Centre, in the Georgian area which is a bit quieter than many other spots. Breakfast is spectacular. But...the hotel is underwhelming. The peat fireplace is always going, making the back house very smoky. The carpeting is worn out, and the furniture is banged up. The shower could not be worse. No views. TVs are 25 years old, and the reception is terrible. The wifi is a mess. I want to like the hotel because of the great owners, but I can't say I would stay here again.",3,2015,07,07
216,Excellent location in Georgian Dublin,"While not central, one is a 15 minute walk from many south side attractions and even closer to top restaurants; note this hotel is ideal to explore Georgian houses (and doors) in Dublin. This was the best breakfast we had in our 2 week trip in Ireland, in a nice veranda. There is a walled garden to relax from the city. Staff and cats were very friendly.",5,2015,06,23
216,Great Way to Start a Visit to Dublin,"Great location; wonderful and very helpful hosts; very friendly staff; excellent breakfasts. Noel and his staff learned our names and gave us many helpful hints and suggestions about what to do, where to go and how to get there. Very comfortable bed - important to a spouse with a bad back.",5,2015,06,18
216,Great breakfast and service,"The best breakfast we have ever had at any hotel or B&B.  Service was friendly and excellent.  The only reason I didn't give this a 5 star review was that while the beds and bathrooms were top notch, the rest of the furnishings were ""tired"" and in need of both repair and/or replacement.",4,2015,06,15
216,Nice but too far from center,"I really like this Hotel/ B&B but my husband felt like for the money, we should have been closer to city center. It took us about 20 minutes to walk to Trinity College from here. Cool rooms though. We were in the back house, in a renovated Georgian home, decorated with modern/shabby chic furniture. The garden that separates was adorable and the perfect spot for our arrival tea and coffee.",4,2015,06,14
216,For Those Who Want to Feel Like a True Dubliner,"We recently spent 2 nights at Number 31 and had a lovely stay. A few standouts from our visit:

1) We were traveling with a 9 month old baby. The hotel provided a travel cot for him, which lightened our load during our travels. They also assigned us a lovely room in the muse house, which was somewhat separated from the other guests. This was great for us because we did not have to worry about disturbing anyone if our jet lagged little one started making noise. The kitchen also was accommodating for a baby offering to make him breakfast every morning. The grounds also have a garden and warm lounge area, which gave us extra places to let our baby play and explore. I would definitely recommend this hotel for travelers with infants.

2) The location could not have been better. We were surprised by how close we were to Stephens Green and Grafton Street. It is less than a 10 minute walk to Stephens Green through a lovely part of the city. Temple Bar and even the Bachelors Walk area across the river are close enough to walk on a nice day. (We actually walked all the way to Guinness, which was a 30+ minute walk, but also doable and a great opportunity to see the city.) And because Number 31 is not right in the center of the tourist attractions, you can stay here without feeling like such a tourist.

3) We were greeted with an offer of fresh tea or coffee and cookies, which was a warm welcome after a long flight. We actually requested coffee and cookies to our room a few times as well when our little one had us up before breakfast and the staff happily accommodated us. The staff was so kind and helpful. Sam from the main office was a standout!

4) The hotel has free parking right at the front door, which is key if you are renting a car and driving the country like we did.

The only negative thing I can say about the hotel is that the leather couch in the lounge needs refurbishing. It is one of the first things when you walk in so it is a shame to see it in disrepair. The lounge is such a cozy, inviting place. It would be worth Number 31's money to fix it up a bit.

If we find ourselves in Dublin again, we would be delighted to return.",4,2015,06,13
216,Brilliant Boutique Dublin Hotel,"My husband and I enjoyed another amazing visit to Number 31 in Dublin. Located in a beautiful Georgian neighborhood and within walking distance of Saint Stephen's Green, Number 31 is the type of hotel where you truly feel like a local, at home in charming Dublin. While Number 31 does not necessarily have all of the amenities of a large hotel, what it lacks in miscellaneous extra services, it makes up in the perfectly hospitable overall experience. We had a familiar cozy welcome, with the fire burning and a hot pot of tea and cookies waiting for us on arrival. It was like coming home after many weary days of traveling in Scotland and Ireland after a long journey over from across the pond. Our room was incredibly comfortable, warm and inviting, and pristinely clean. The owners were absolutely accommodating with maps and directions, recommendations for dinner and attractions, and assisted us in booking numerous taxi cab rides all over the city for various engagements that we had while we were in Dublin. The breakfasts, as we had remembered, were outstanding. As I told the owners when we returned to Number 31 - ""I have dreams of the breakfasts here"" - and I still do! We will certainly be back to Number 31 the next time we are in Dublin for another lovely visit.",5,2015,06,08
216,Dublin Heaven,"I can not say enough good and wonderful things about this place.  We arrived at 8am from a long flight from Newark.  Our bags were taken away and we were escorted to the dinning room for a fantastic breakfast!  Noel and his staff could not have been any kinder or hospitable.   

Every morning Noel greeted you with a happy face and positive attitude on the upcoming day.  All the breakfast selection were just outstanding.  Hey I even started eating the black pudding!!!

We stayed in 5 places on our whirl wind tour of Ireland and Number 31 was, by far, the best.",5,2015,06,04
216,Disappointed,"Based on photos and recommendations, I booked Number 31 and I was expecting an exceptional place based on the price. Our stay was a huge disappointment and not worth what we paid. I am really glad we only stayed one night. First of all, the room was very dark and had many cracks on the walls and ceiling. It looked like they were trying to cover up how bad it looked by keeping the rooms dark.  In addition, when I pulled back the blankets the sheet was dirty with marks on it.  

To access the internet service, you must sign on within a certain time from when they provide you the code.  However, I did not know this and left for dinner. We missed our time. So, when we returned and tried to access the free internet we did not have service. Also, our room faced the noisy street and there was a car alarm going off most of the night. Needless to say, I did not sleep much that night.
This so called establishment is overrated and overpriced. The breakfast was adequate, but definitely not an award winning breakfast as advertised. The staff was friendly. I would not recommend Number 31 to our friends and was the worst place we stayed at during our 12 day trip to Europe.",1,2015,06,01
216,Fabulous Hosts!,"Noel and his staff made this our most welcoming stay in Ireland.  We arrived early, and were treated to breakfast while our rooms were being prepared (best breakfasts in the country, by the way).  Helpful staff valet parked when the lot was full.  Location is perfect (just close enough to the action but not in the heart of touristy area).  Need a taxi, dinner recommendation, or walking map, staff couldn't be happier to oblige.",5,2015,06,01
216,Going Back 4 More,"No 31 on Leeson Street is a guesthouse in the true sense. You feel like a guest in someone's home. It is part Modern design renovated by architect Sam Stephenson with the back house being a separate Georgian house with a beautiful garden in between the 2 structures.  My room was in the back house and a perfect jewel of a space–simple, comfortable, clean, and well-tended everyday.  There was a little noise off the street but nothing awful.  I was quickly aware that I was sleeping on a Hasten bed, a great luxury for anyone with a bad back.  The breakfast is legendary in the city and held me till late afternoon. It begins with coffee–strong and flavorful–that made me smile and walk upright. Followed by yogurt, fresh fruit,  muesli, soda bread, Irish butter, and, then, a hot breakfast.Noel (proprietor) and Linda are great help for planning the days or for longer excursions.  One note,  for people who are looking for the W or 4 Seasons perfection and luxury this is not going to be your place.  This is a place for people who want something real, but more low key.",5,2015,05,28
216,Literally the best breakfast!,"We arrived in Dublin for our last 2 nights on our trip home from Australia and had a wonderful time and were wonderfully hosted by Noel and the team. From the minute you walk in there is a real wow factor. Absolutely fantastic decor and the breakfast was the best ever. I have since been trying to replicate the rhubarb compote! We will definitely return, I can't imagine staying anywhere else in Dublin. Great location also, have lived in Dublin for 6 years and can say it is in the best location. The only thing I would fault is the walk to the top floor up the many many stairs with very very heavy bags. Knowing this now I will ask for a lower level.",5,2015,05,27
216,Little gem!,"After a long flight I arrive before 10 AM and was warmly welcomed by the owner and escorted to their sunny seating area for a delicious breakfast. I was able to get into my room after a short wait so I was able to freshen up before heading out. They have a lovely small courtyard behind the town house.
Quick walk over to St Stephens Green park and Trinity College as well as the heart of Dublin. 
Their beds and pillows are wonderful!
They recommend a very local  cafe which was a great bistro. Highly recommend Number 31 and will stay there on my next Dublin visit.",5,2015,05,26
216,94 steps and grounds for divorce ,"Never have my wife and I so vehemently disagreed on a stay. I hated everything about it (four flights - 94 stairs - to our room, traffic noise, absent staff and tiny, dark-dank overpriced rooms) yet she found redeeming virtues in the location, price and ambience.  She booked it and was trying make the best of the mistake. Read the poor reviews on Trip advisor. They are accurate. My advice is to spend a few dollars more and stay in a real hotel, with real staff and in a convenient location. Sometimes ""boutique"" is a guise for old and bad, which is exactly the case with Number 31. Avoid it. ",1,2015,05,25
216,What's Not To Love About This Hotel?,"We recently spent four nights at Number 31 and loved everything about the property.  The service we received from Noel and the entire staff was top notch from the moment we arrived throughout our departure. Our Georgian room was lovely, as was the courtyard, and the breakfast was amazing. The location could not have been better. We would definitely book here again and highly recommend Number 31. ",5,2015,05,22
216,Excellent stay,"My wife and I were attending a wedding in Dublin prior to taking ferry to UK. We therefore were quite keen on getting something central with parking, a hard option to find in Dublin. It is very central so impatient drivers amongst morning traffic outside open windows negated us having to set an alarm call. - This did not bother us as it is very quiet during our sleeping hours.
We were warmly welcomed, offered tea/coffee, before being shown to our room.
Breakfast were excellent.  Layout is quirky which adds to the charm of the place.  If you like something different, eclectic (in a good way) boutique hotel rather than a large bustling hotel then this is a very good choice.  Well done to all, we look forward to returning.",5,2015,05,21
216,Best breakfast in Ireland,"My two friends and I were welcomed with tea and cranberry bread and shown to our spotless rooms.  We received a map and great advice for getting around Dublin by Linda.  Our three rooms were quiet and comfortable, and the bath facilities were wonderful.  The location is in a nice neighborhood, within comfortable walking distance of Grafton Street and St. Stephen's park.  Linda also provided suggestions for neighborhood restaurants—The Farm and The Sussex were terrific.  We spent three nights and then toured the rest of Ireland for a week.  Noel, Linda, Erica, and Elana were very hospitable and full of great suggestions for getting about the city.  Delia's breakfasts are the best of all the hotels we stayed in that week.  We returned for one last night on May 3 before flying back the next day.  We were welcomed ""home"" by all the staff.  This is a very special hotel with a personal touch, and I would return again and again.",5,2015,05,10
216,A very good base for exploring the city,"Very friendly and helpful welcome greeted us to Number 31. We were not sure quite what to expect but the entrance space certainly raised our interest where we were treated to tea and cakes whilst we discussed our plans for our visit with our host who was most helpful.
We were on the top floor which was quite a trek and in another building, no problem but quite a few steps! The room was very nicely decorated in modern style, bathroom was lovely and the bedding was the highest quality meaning we slept very well indeed. 
Our hosts were most accomodating as we had to leave early to catch a ferry home, but they were happy to cook up whatever we wanted for breakfast which was lovely.
We would happily stay again, however it was not the cheapest night we had on our break. Having not stayed in Dublin for some years, we cannot directly compare so all in all we were extremely happy.",4,2015,05,06
216,Beyond Wonderful!,"Loved this place! Breakfast was incredible, several options to choose from or you could mix and match. Had a granola/ yogurt bar to start off with, toast and homemade breads. Staff was very attentive, room was spotless. Will be staying here again next time I'm in Dublin. Noel is wonderful and full of recommendations about restaurants.",5,2015,05,01
216,Extremely enjoyable stay!,"My partner and I have just returned from a 3 night stay at Number 31... And what a delightful experience we have had! 
Having travelled in on the Airbus from the airport we got off at Lower Lesson street with a short walk turning down by Starbucks to Number 31 and were welcomed with open arms. We knew we were early about 10am but were shown upstair to have some breakfast which my other half gladly took up the offer of scrambled eggs and salmon! After a quick and informative orientation of the city including a map we were shown to our room in the Mews Accomodation. I only know there are two areas to the accommodation from reading about it on here. Our room was number 46. It was extremely spacious and just what we needed. The only comment I would make is that we were right beside the kitchen and heard plates etc in the morning - that didn't bother us at all. I quite like to hear 'lived in' noise in the morning however some folk may be put off by this... 
Breakfast was substantial and delicious!! We sampled the eggs and salmon, full Irish and the porridge. Portions were huge and I actually asked for half portions of porridge.
Overall the location is brilliant if you don't mind a 10min walk to the centre, room was just what you needed and it was nice to have a more personal touch than just staying in a large chain. 
Oh - and a special mention to the lovely girl who served us breakfast everyday. She was so cheery and pleasant and I regret not asking her name!!",5,2015,05,01
216,Wonderful,"The kindness and hospitality we received at Number 31 was extraordinary. The accommodations, the recommendations, the traditional Irish breakfast - everything was outstanding. Noel, Linda, and the entire staff went above and beyond to make our first visit to Dublin a memorable one, and truly made us feel at home. Looking forward to a return trip!",5,2015,05,01
216,"""Defines Bed and Breakfast!""","Warm, friendly people, great rooms, comfortable bed and the best breakfast you can get!
You feel as if you are staying with extended family (but nicer!).  Ask Noel to tell you about the history of his establishment -  it is extremely interesting.   Very close to St. Stephen's which we used as our landmark and resting place after a long day of sightseeing.  You cannot go wrong with No. 31-We loved it.",5,2015,04,26
216,Great Find!!,"Number 31's kind, amazing and sophisticated host Noel made our stay one to remember. The breakfasts were delicious and rich -- with lots of cooked options and the opportunity each morning for engaging conversation in the well-appointed indoor/outdoor breakfast lounge. The location is ideal - quiet, close to cultural highlights, pubs, cafes and shopping. Noel's professional service, very good tips for Dublin (including the Rugby QF) and friendly manner to us and our two daughters made this the ideal place for us to stay…I will be back with my family!",5,2015,04,10
216,Home from home in Dublin. Stay here.,"This is how a hotel should be.  Warm, friendly welcome; interesting rooms; excellent coffee/tea when we are flagging; and breakfasts?
Breakfasts are a speciality here, with fresh squeezed juice, fresh fruit, and then a great Full Irish or other equally tasty options.
Why is it so good? The owners run it, and make sure it is. And they are great people too.
We stayed 3 nights in a house just through the small garden but the premises at no.31 Leeson Close have an interesting history. Hear all about it.",5,2015,04,10
216,"Welcoming, unique - Boutique hotel","We have just spent a lovely night here over the bank holiday weekend.
Noel was very attentive and welcoming. 
The breakfast was Perfect with a fantastic choice.
Rooms were very unique.
Overall a very good choice .
Thank you for your hospitality.",4,2015,04,08
216,Great Experience!,"We stayed for one night at Number 31 -- and it was wonderful!  After our long overnight flight, we were warmly greeted by Noel when we arrived.  He served us some much needed coffee and gave us some great sight-seeing tips for the day.  Our room was perfect -- large, comfy beds and spotless!    Breakfast in the morning was delicious.  The staff was great!  We will definitely be back!!",5,2015,04,08
216,Lovely little getaway,"What a lovely stay. From the moment we walked into the courtyard, and then the sunken living room, we knew this place would be a welcome respite from the hustle and bustle of the city. The hosts were personable, fun and helpful. Breakfast was delicious and made to order. We would definitely visit again!",5,2015,04,05
216,Great Irish Hospitality,Everything went perfectly smoothly.  Lovely staff. Fantastic breakfast. Very comfortable all around.  Noel was the perfect host.  He was charming and full of information. He could help us with every question.  Beautiful hotel and gardens!,5,2015,04,02
216,Do not miss out on this hidden gem!,"Never have I been made to feel so welcome at a hotel.  Upon arrival from our early morning flight, we were offered a complimentary breakfast, which was totally delicious and completely set us up for a day exploring Dublin (the freshly squeezed juice and home made cranberry bread deserves a special mention). We were given some great advice on what to do, everyone was so friendly and the location is terrific - very central.  Our room was generously sized with patio doors into a pretty private terrace.  The bathroom was huge!  A big part of holidays for me is to have the opportunity to be inspired by interiors and No 31 was particularly memorable for me.  Loved the sunken leather sofas, wood burner and persian rug against white paintwork.  Beautiful!  An awesome choice.",5,2015,03,25
216,Made our stay in Dublin a very special one,"Great place to stay for a weekend. Noel and his team made our party feel really welcome. Nothing was too much trouble. This is a very special place to relax and it was so nice to know that after a busy day out and about in Dublin that we were going back to number 31. Really interesting architecture, stylish interiors and Noel shared the fabulous history of the property with us. The beds were comfortable with a choice of pillows and the breakfast choice was excellent. A suggestion would be that we could have done with a little more lighting in the room in the evening but this is just a minor point as overall this is a fantastic place to stay.",5,2015,03,08
216,High Standard bed and breakfast rather than a hotel,"The plusses are definitely the people who are lovely and the really high quality breakfast .
Location is good and it was a brisk walk to St Stephens Green .
Fixtures and fittings are good quality as are the toiletries .
My room was fine as it was quite high up the house but others in our party 
commented on noise from the street.
Wi-fi was free but very slow and a desk in the room would be a plus .
All in all a good experience but don't expect a hotel .",4,2015,03,01
216,"Good location & cosy room, but noisy!","We stayed in Number 31 for two nights over Valentine's Day weekend. It's in a great location just a short walk to St Stephen's Green and the hotel itself is very nice - we had a cosy room (a bit on the small side but fine) and a very comfy bed. However our room was positioned upstairs directly next to the breakfast area and from 8am onwards it was incredibly noisy! We could hear people's conversations, plates and cutlery clattering around, children crying etc - not ideal if you want a lie in anytime after 8am. I think that the hotel itself is great and breakfast was superb but for the price we paid (which was NOT cheap!) I would have liked a different room away from the din of the breakfast area which, as two tired Londoners looking for a relaxing break, nearly spoilt the weekend for us.",3,2015,02,17
216,Fabulous!,"A huge thank you to Noel and his staff for making our first visit to Dublin a memorable one.  Would thoroughly recommend this beautiful haven of tranquillity, from the breakfast, the service, and not forgetting the fabulous décor of the hotel.  Great location.",5,2015,02,08
216,Really lovely place to stay!,"I loved staying here - it really did feel like a home away from home, and we wished we were staying longer! Everyone working here was very friendly, and we felt very welcome in your lovely place. Fresh coffee/tea and biscuits were offered on arrival and we had a few moments on the (very cool) sunken sofa next to the fire to gather our thoughts before heading to our room. Breakfast the next morning was also fantastic. Really great location - 10 mins walk to the main part of town. Plus the Aircoach has a stop to/from the airport about 5 mins walk from the hotel (on Lower Leeson Street).

If I was being a bit picky, the room itself needed a bit of love/ maintenance - which we didn't mind personally, but for €175 for the night I could understand why some might find it a bit overpriced (for example instead of a double bed we had two singles pushed together - this was not ideal and they created a very hard line down the middle of the bed, and the wardrobe had been damaged on top and needed refinishing). These kind of touches would just take my experience up to the 'luxury' level I was expecting for the price.

However, that said, I really wouldn't think twice about coming back - I loved it here. And I thoroughly recommend it - much nicer than staying in a commercial hotel!",4,2015,01,19
216,Better than home !,Fantastic service and delicious breakfasts in this boutique hotel ! The hostess went the extra mile and even called and got me a new rental car when I had a flat tire on the way from the airport ! Comfortable and spacious rooms in a convenient location a few blocks from St. Stephens square. This place is like you are home with your parents again doting on you and taking care of every little need. You WON'T be disappointed !,5,2015,01,07
216,Warm hospitality,"We, a family of two adults and a teenager, stayed at Number 31 for 4 nights in October and we couldn’t have been happier about our choice of accommodation which was based on the reviews here on TA.

It’s a gorgeous hotel that consists of two very different buildings separated by a courtyard. We stayed in a very nice and spacious family room in the Georgian building. The beds were really comfortable and the room was quiet, even though we were at ground level facing the street. The only small disadvantage was that the bathroom was a bit dark.

The breakfast was served in the modern building and the choices were many and made-to-order; there was also a nice buffet. Everything was fresh and absolutely delicious.

The owners as well as the rest of the staff were lovely, welcoming and service-oriented. We loved being seated by the peat fire in the sunken living room at arrival, offered a cup of tea and cookies and then given some starting information about Dublin. Such a nice welcome!

The location in a peaceful area of central Dublin is very convenient. Whenever we return to Dublin, Number 31 will be our place to stay!",5,2015,01,05
216,A hidden gem in Dublin!,"When traveling to Dublin recently for a wedding, an Irish friend recommended another luxury hotel in Temple Bar....and are we glad we did our research!  We chose No. 31 based on the TA reviews, and we definitely made the right choice.  The location is perfect, just a short walk away from the relentless (and late night) hustle and bustle of Grafton St. and environs.  It was a peaceful oasis--a gift, compared to the experiences of our fellow travelers staying at luxury properties in the very thick of things.  Despite a very early arrival, we were welcomed cheerfully by Noel, with open arms, and invited to join for breakfast.  And what a breakfast it was!  So many choices, so wonderfully prepared, and the perfect way to start your exploration of the city.  Our room was quite large and very comfortably appointed.  The bed is incredibly comfortable and the linens very nice quality.  The bathroom is a bit dark, but nothing a makeup mirror wouldn't solve.  On a return trip, we stayed in a smaller room that was just as nicely appointed, and perhaps even more cozy.  The beautiful Georgian house was wonderfully decorated for the holidays.  The real reason to stay at No. 31, though, is the staff--Noel and team are absolutely wonderful!  It really is like staying in the very lovely home of an old friend. We will never stay anywhere else in Dublin!

Note:  if your preference is a chain hotel experience with amenities such as a bar and nightlife, this is not the place for you.   But if you want a memorable, comfortable, incredibly gracious experience, then look no further.",5,2014,12,18
216,"Warm welcome, lovely stay","We stayed at Number 31 for a 4-night trip to Dublin at the start of December. Noel, his family and staff were great hosts, helpful and friendly without being intrusive. The legendary breakfasts will set you up for the day, you probably won't need to eat again until the evening.

The Georgian house was beautifully decorated, the room was spacious and quiet (apart from a little road noise but you are in the centre of a capital city) and the rainfall shower was great with plentiful hot water (we were in room 33). Probably the most comfortable bed we've ever slept in too.

This is not the cheapest place to stay, but we thought it was great value when you consider that most Dublin hotels don't offer free breakfast, and for a breakfast of this quality and quantity you'd probably pay 30 euro per head.

This was our first trip to Dublin and we're looking forward to returning to this friendly city and to Number 31.",5,2014,12,18
216,Breakfast saved the stay,"My husband and I wanted to get away to the city for a little break from the children for dinner, movies and some sleep.  Based on photos and recommendations, I booked Number 31 as it promised a stylish, boutique hotel with excellent warm service, a roaring fire in a spectacular common area and wonderful breakfasts.  Well, at least the breakfast did not disappoint. 

Upon our arrival we were greeted by a tired young man, who introduced himself as Sam and was clearly just doing his job in offering a ""tea or coffee"" accompanied by a couple of tasteless commercial cookies.  At 190 euro a night, I was more than surprised to see a completely worn and torn leather couch in the common area.  A couple of cushions were even turned over, most likely because they were completely split down the middle.  The fire was barely going, and the soap dispenser in the bathroom was broken.  After ten minutes, Sam showed us to the room.  

On the way to the hotel part of the property, I asked Sam about the history of this Georgian house, but he was not able to offer much information, which was a shame.  The hall of the house, where the rooms are located looked quite splendid - high ceilings, stucco plaster elements, covered in matte gold paint and warm brown hues.  However, the room was a huge disappointment.  It looked like someone tried to follow as similar design concept, but gave up half-way, placing awkward furniture in a room along with a couple of truly wonderful ceiling lamp shades.  The walls, painted the same chocolate brown, were peeling terribly, with a few random swiped of a second coat of paint in an attempt to ""fix the problem"".  The ceiling was cracked and had many water damage spots.  We had immediately asked Sam for a second blanket, and he assured us it was not problem.    

Before leaving for dinner, I wanted to fix up my makeup.  That is not an easy task at no. 31, as there are barely any lights in the bathroom at all, perhaps as an attempt to hide the horrible state of the bathroom window - paint peeling, cracking, dirt in all the corners.  It was barely possible to brush one's teeth properly in the dim light, not to mention nearly impossible to apply make up before going out.  Before heading out, we phoned reception and reminded Sam about a blanket.  He said it was on the way as we spoke. 

Returning to the room after dinner and a movie, we realized Sam got lost along the way.  But at least he had a blanket to keep warm.  On the plus side, in the morning the rain shower did have enough pressure and hot water.  And breakfast - as promised, it was a highlight of our stay at no. 31.",2,2014,12,17
216,Cant wait to go back,"I chose Number 31 based on TA reviews and was not disappointed.  

The warm welcome with a cup of tea & cake in front of the fire, the friendliness of all the team at Number 31, the really comfortable bed, the perfect location for exploring Dublin and the amazing breakfast all contributed to a great few days.  The only issue I had was my room was freezing both nights, I'm not sure if that is normal but it was so so cold and there was no way to control the heat, but luckily the bedding was great so once I was in bed all was OK and I slept really well. 

I will be back to Dublin soon, love the city and the people, and would love to stay here again. I recommend Number 31 to anyone coming to Dublin.",5,2014,12,11
216,A gem,"Due to work commitments I have been in a hotel at least once a week for the past 10yrs, I found number 31 thru a friend and will look forward to staying here every chance I get to be in dublin,great staff,you almost feel like you are coming back to an old friends house.the breakfast is to die for,i would happily stay for the breakfast alone.",5,2014,11,27
216,Updated,"Stayed here 3 yrs ago and loved it although it really needed an update. Other than that - the service was great, breakfast amazing and an easy walk to where I needed to be. Recommended it to family and then friends - all had a great time and loved the ambience but agreed with the need for updating. Seen this has happened - looks great - next time in the city - will only stay there",4,2014,11,20
216,Delightful! ,"Number 31 is absolutely wonderful and after staying here on my first trip to Dublin, I will be returning! The breakfasts are so so delicious (I miss them!) and complimentary tea, coffee, hot chocolate and biscuits are available whenever - which is ideal after a busy day in the city! The staff are so kind and helpful, the decor is really cool and tasteful, the destination is great as you can tumble straight out of the hotel onto the streets of main-town Dublin and be in any part of the city before long. Fortunately, I don't mind street noise at night but, as I was placed in the room nearest the street, I can imagine this would have been a problem if I had minded it. However, it's really not that loud considering it's in the middle of a capital city and I'm sure that if I had had a problem, the staff would have done their upmost to help out! The only slight downfall is the wifi as it kept cutting out, but given all the positives Number 31 has to offer, this is hardly a problem! A word of advice: where possible get a taxi from the airport to the hotel as there is very limited parking. Loved it and cannot wait till my return!",5,2014,11,17
216,Far surpassed our expectations!,"Even before we got to 31, I was very impressed. The owners offered for us to have breakfast because our flight was arriving early in the morning. They set up a car to pick us up and bring us to the door. We landed from our overnight flight an hour early because of a time change and arrived before 7am at the door of the inn. Sensing that we were exhausted, we were given a room to rest until breakfast was served. This was at no additional charge and without asking! Those extra hours of sleep were priceless! We had reserved a four person room but were upgraded to two 2-person rooms. Again at no additional charge. Breakfast is even better than advertised (It has won best breakfast in Dublin.) The staff was lovely and suggested a number of great restaurants that were off of the beaten path. I can't imagine having anywhere close to this experience if we had gone to a hotel chain, no matter how nice! 
We will come again if we ever back to Dublin!!",5,2014,11,13
216,An oasis in the city,"This hotel is absolutely gorgeous, and the hosts are just lovely beyond words. The owner, Noel, welcomed us with open arms and immediately made me and my mam feel at home. The breakfast is absolutely fantastic, especially the eggs benedict! The hotel itself is charming and historic, with a beautiful (and strangely peaceful) courtyard which you could sit in for hours and completely forget you are in the city centre. I was staying in Dublin on a work trip, and this hotel and it's hosts made the trip so enjoyable and relaxing that I will be staying there every time I visit from now on :)",5,2014,10,23
216,Great way to experience Dublin!,"What a lucky surprise! Charming, quirky boutique hotel in a lovely area.  We had a spacious room in the Georgian building with views over the back courtyard.  Very dark and quiet.  Guest services and breakfast are in an architecturally-significant, re-habbed mews on the other side of the courtyard.  Amazing breakfast served in a fun, party atmosphere.  Could have sat there all day.  Staff is lovely and warm and exceptionally service-oriented.  Neighborhood is easy walking distance to St. Stephen's Green and Baggot St Lower nightlife.  You should know: area is not residential; thus, is a bit deserted after dark, especially when walking back late at night.  We always felt safe, to be sure.",4,2014,10,20
216,Make it your first choice for Dublin,"Loved 31 from the moment we arrived. Greeted warmly by the lovely Linda, sat down by a wonderful peat fire to warm up. The press coffee and cookies were just what we needed. In spite of a booking problem that was our fault, Linda worked everything out and went beyond to make sure we were happy and situated. Our room was large with tall ceilings, leather sofa, and a large wardrobe. The bathroom was clean, and had a powerful rain shower.
Breakfast was delicious and made to order as well as a continental choice.
The location is perfect for walking all over Dublin city...and they will provide a map and ideas on what to see. Would love to go back!",5,2014,10,20
216,Can't wait to return,"So happy to have had the opportunity to stay at Number 31. The welcoming hosts make guests feel they are visiting good friends. Well appointed large room, beautiful, small bathroom and the best breakfast to be had in Dublin! Friendly helpful hosts made our stay absolutely perfect.",5,2014,10,19
216,"Great hotel, great location, and fantastic breakfast","Number 31 is charmingly tucked away from the hustle and bustle of Dublin but is also incredibly conveniently located to the major sites.  Just down the street from St. Stephen's Green, the staff at Number 31 are knowledgeable and considerate and the accommodations are lovely.  They are known for having an outstanding breakfast and it exceeded our expectations.  Would definitely stay there again and am happy to give Number 31 an outstanding recommendation.",5,2014,10,18
216,Great property with some reservations,"We arrived at Number 31, and Sam was so kind to offer us some tea and tell us about restaurants close to the hotel and how to find the On and Off Bus.  Our room was huge also and quiet for the most part.  Our only complaint was the owner (not sure of his name) who came in a few times to stoke the fire in the main sitting area and walked by us at breakfast did not seem to want any contact with the guests beyond hello.  In fact the last day, we came in to eat breakfast, and he was having breakfast with another man in the dining room.  He barely acknowledged us and then he started whispering and covering his mouth when he spoke to the other person.  If he did not want us in the vicinity, it might be better to not have a business meeting in the main dining area.  Usually the host comes out and is asks if we need help, how our stay is, how the food is etc.  We felt like we were in the way.",4,2014,10,10
216,"Beautiful, charming and friendly!","My husband and I wrapped up two weeks in Ireland with a three night stay at Number 31. We had changed our reservation dates twice - once just a week before our anticipated arrival, and were completely charmed. The building is beautiful, with a courtyard where one can share the neighbor's three kitties. Our room was next to the street, and there were a few late-night passersby who may have had a jar too many, but this is Dublin, right? The host, Noel (I hope I spelled that right) was extra charming, as were all staff we encountered, and he especially shone at breakfast. Breakfast choices were just about anything you could want, deliciously prepared and beautifully presented. Then there's this: our departure was at 6:00 a.m., meaning rising at 5:00 a.m., meaning a pretty ditsy me. I left my favorite (and not inexpensive) glasses and book (five pages from the end!) on the mantel in our room. Oh, no!!! Called Linda at Number 31 the next day, and she immediately put them in the mail (to Colorado, USA!!) at no charge to me. What a DARLING! 

There is a fabulous restaurant (Brasserie le Pont)  across the street, and a fine pub just around the corner, where we heard some really wonderful live music and poetry.

I'm not a good traveler, and the charm, friendliness and relaxed atmosphere of Number 31 were just what I needed at the end of our journey. 

P.S. Number 31 is very close to St. Stephen's Green, from which one can get on the hop on/hop off bus - very convenient.",5,2014,10,10
216,Super digs!,"Cannot say much more than other reviewers, bwut this boutique hotel is really lovely. Everything about it is classy. From the greeting at the front door after our transatlantic fight...and an offer for a hot cooked breakfast, to the very warm service from all the staff and owners. Will recommend to others, and would not hesitate to return. Oh yes, the breakfasts were really above average! Great fresh fruit, delicious coffee and eggs prepared in a wide variety of ways. Yum!",5,2014,10,08
216,Friendliest in Dublin,"Number 31 is an extraordinary choice for those looking for a friendly welcome and delicious and inviting breakfast. The owners welcome you with open arms -- literally, they hugged me -- and accommodate you immediately. We arrived from a transatlantic flight at 0930 and they immediately invited us to enjoy breakfast while our room was prepared. The Full Irish here is to die for but -- fair warning -- it will literally keep you full ALL DAY. There are many healthy fruit, yogurt, and granola selections as well. 

We stayed in one of the front rooms looking out onto the street. It wasn't the quietest but it was nicely appointed and the bed was very comfortable. My only suggestion to the owners would be to increase the lighting in the room. Even with the curtains open and all the lights on, we found ourselves struggling to see/find things in our luggage. 

I would definitely return to Number 31 on future visits to Dublin, if not just for the breakfast.",5,2014,10,02
216,Beautiful respite in the middle of the city,"We stayed in one of the grand Georgian rooms in the front of the property.  It was quiet, there were nice thick curtains to keep out the light as well.  Nice decor in the room that was fitting to the period and also nicely modern.  The breakfast and welcome area in the main house is bright, welcoming and a great step out of the busy city.  There's a peat fire going during the day and the owners are very helpful in getting you settled, whatever time you get into town.  Breakfast is delicious with fresh orange juice, fruits and cereals and a great variety of breakfast choices.  They also were extremely helpful getting up re-united with a forgotten phone.  I've stayed before and would continue to return each time I stay in Dublin.  They continue to be a top notch accommodation.",5,2014,10,01
216,Excellent boutique hotel,"The rooms are showing their age here, but the accommodations are very comfortable, the hosts friendly and informative, the location excellent. We were warmly greeted with a nice snack and very informative chat. The rooms were rather small, but comfortable and entirely adequate. The building is showing its age, and the interior could use some minor repairs/touchup, but overall charming and we would definitely return.",4,2014,09,25
216,quaint and friendly,"We visited Dublin for the first time and were met with Noel's warm and energetic personality.the location is great, the food wonderful and the staff and hospitality very warm. the bed was comfortable but the rooms need some updating. If you are looking for quaint and friendly this is the place to be.",4,2014,09,16
216,"Exceptional - Artistic, Quiet, Charming and well located","Highly recommend this special, boutique hotel.  Located close to the city center for a nice walk through the park.  Noel and Linda have ensured incredible attention to all details in the rooms, the public spaces and the garden between the two houses.  A retreat of quiet and relaxation to explore Dublin.  Best breakfast we had in Ireland, the best fresh fruit (berries) and a choice of many option on a hot breakfast.  Staying here was like having an apartment in Dublin, personal, comfortable and in redesigned town houses with architectural design.  Service was very professional, rooms clean and free wi-fi.",5,2014,09,07
216,"Jon B - ""Exceeded Expectations""","Four of us traveled to Dublin to watch the PSU/UCF football game and staying at Number 31 surely exceeded all our expectations.    The management and staff were all exceptionally professional, attentive and courteous.   Rooms were super clean and the breakfast was superb--hard to believe there was a better breakfast anywhere in the city.   It's just now three days later and I still miss having my morning grumb from this place.

Location is also great ... inside the city but not in the heart.   It was very quiet, restful and away from all the club noise and traffic yet you could walk almost anywhere.  Highly recommended this place to anyone.   The owner Noel is a gem.  

First class service at a more than fair price.",5,2014,09,03
216,Absolutely Fabulous!,"My husband and I have had the pleasure of enjoying Noel's hospitality on several occasions.  This gem of a boutique hotel is tucked away in the city centre yet is very quiet and restful.  From the warm greeting offering to show you to your room or let you settle in the lounge with tea or coffee and some home made baked goods by the fire to the really wonderful breakfast, the staff is helpful but unobtrusive.  They allow you to enjoy the rooms and garden in peace, yet, if you seek help or advice on the city, they are right there for you.  In recommending Number 31 to friends, I have described it as like staying with friends of friends.  It is as if you know them right away",5,2014,09,02
216,Great location & Breakfasts,"Staying at Number 31 in Dublin is a great experience. Great location right near St Stephens Green & excellent room. Very welcoming hosts & staff & everything I had read on TripAdvisor about the breakfasts was true, in particular the amazing eggs benedict & my wife raved about the cheese omelette. A great start to the day.",5,2014,08,27
216,We have stayed at Number 31 many times and so are beginning to run out of superlatives!,"But, as always, the room wasvery comfortable and well equipped and the legendary breakfast lived up to all expectations.  But it is the people who make No. 31 what it is, so thank you very much to Noel and his team.",5,2014,08,13
216,Cosy and quite place in Dublin,"We booked a 3-bed room and they gave us two 2-bed rooms. Very nice service. We arrived late night and were very uncertain about the place as once can hardly see a hotel when in standing front of the outer door. However, we were warmly welcome.
Breakfast is really as they advertise it.",5,2014,08,09
216,Extraordinary Experience,"I have had the opportunity to travel quite a bit, at times in hotels rated some of the best in the world. Seldom has my experience matched the few days I had at Number 31. This charming, beautifully designed hotel has a staff and culture that is unmatched. Noel, the owner delightfully describes the rich history of the buildings and is available to assist with any questions you may have. Breakfast allows the choice of sitting with other guests and, each morning, resulted in a delightful conversation that equalled the extraordinary food. I unfortunately left my passport at the hotel and Noel refused to accept payment for the overnight mail return. The care with which the passport was wrapped (including a plastic cover in case it got wet) reinforces the attention to detail that, compined with the true hospitality, makes this a very special experience.",5,2014,08,03
216,Great place to stay,"This is a gorgeous B&B with a fascinating history. The rooms are beautiful and very comfortable, each with it's own personality. It sits just off the main road so is very quiet too. The breakfasts are superb and although it is probably a cliche to say to talk about the Irish welcome as being very friendly and warm- that is exactly what you get at Number 31. It is a short walk to the city centre and on main bus route.",5,2014,08,01
216,Dublin at it's best...,"A hidden gem.
From our arrival very early on friday morning when welcomed with a complimentary breakfast to afternoon tea with homemade biscuits, to sadly leaving with a prebooked taxi waiting for us, this family run beautiful b&b is a must. It's actually far more glamorous than its b&b listing suggests.
We had a girls weekend doing all of the 'musts' in Dublin. Number 31 is easily walkable into town, even as far as the guiness museum.
It certainly won't be the last time we use this lovely home from home, shared by Noel and his friendly and professional family who own and run it.
Thank you for making us feel so welcome.",5,2014,07,20
216,Just far enough off the beaten path,"My wife and I stayed here recently after being at one of the larger downtown Dublin hotels all week.  It was nice to be in a cozy b&b, not too far from City Center.  Noel, the owner, greeted me upon arrival and my numerous large bags magically made it up to our room while he was showing me a map of the area and giving me tips on where to dine and see sights.  Our room was large and very comfortable.  Since it faced Fitzwilliam St., it was a bit noisy during the day, but quiet at night and on the weekend.  The courtyard is very pleasant and the eating areas delightful.  We chose to eat in the greenhouse each morning, banquet style.  The breakfasts were excellent.
Great service too.  Housekeeping was very efficient and practically invisible.  Just a short walk to the canal, downtown, and various local pubs and eateries.",4,2014,07,16
216,Charming and don't miss the breakfast!,"A charming hotel, located in central Dublin.  The staff were helpful and friendly, the beds comfy and the lounge area excellent.  We loved the garden too.  The highlight was the amazing breakfast - delicious, fresh and served in a light airy room - 10/10

Carol and Jane",5,2014,07,13
216,Superb and centrally located.,"We loved this elegant and well appointed hotel, in a great location only five minutes walk to the centre area of town. The welcome is warm and friendly, the rooms well appointed, although a little dark, and the breakfast unbeatable. Give it a try!",4,2014,07,11
216,charming boutique hotel with the best breakfast,"Boutique retro design hotel in downtown Dublin, well located! The interior design has been created by a famous architect in the 60's, the new owner explains the story of the house when you arrive and offers you the tea time in the garden. Just a perfect welcome before checking-in
Our room was on the 3rd floor in the second bulding, after the courtyard, not the largest one, but the decor is beautiful, very cozy; he Hastens bed very comfortable, and the bed linen are good quality. The rooms are very quiet as the wall of the old house are thick and the carpet on the floor isolate you from the corridor noise.
The breakfast is amazing, like a full brunch with eggs, good bread, fruits, yogurts, etc
I definitely recommend this hotel for a vist of Dublin",5,2014,07,08
216,Exceptional,"The entire staff is amazing; they made our visit and are great Irish ambassadors.  They provided warm, friendly, attentive, accurate, and personal service.  Number 31 has a lot of charm (yet smaller than I expected from the photos).   The Irish breakfast is excellent with many hot options.  French press coffee and tea is upon request, good, and as desired.  The building is historic and very old, but the rooms are well renovated, clean, and unique.  I stayed with my son and we walked everywhere from this very central location in a very nice area of the city.  The Dublin main tourist area is about a 10 to 15 minute walk.    It was a bit of a hike, but we walked to the Guinness Storehouse too.",5,2014,07,05
216,The Best There Is!,This was our second visit to Number 31 and once again our experience was outstanding!  Noel and the staff treat you as you are family coming home.  The service and accommodations are wonderful.  Everyone talks about the breakfast and it truly is the best in Ireland.  Before we left we were talking about how we could visit Ireland again for the primary reason to stay at Number 31 and for a longer period next time!  Thanks to Noel and the staff for treating us like family - we will be back!,5,2014,07,05
216,Nice Place,"We stayed 2 nights and I debated about my review.  We were in room 18 which is ground level and faces Fitzwilliam = street noise and it's busier than I would have expected (ear plugs a must), the only steps were the few from the garden which could be a plus for some.  Space in the room was smallish and we bumped around the furniture/luggage.  Bathroom was OK, towels OK.  It's a 5 to 10 minute walk to St. Stephen's Green and from here to the main attractions including Grafton Street but we like to walk.  There's a HOHO bus stop at St. Stephen's if that interests you.  Breakfast was really good and one morning we splurged on eggs benny - they were excellent.  Service was welcoming and very good.",3,2014,06,29
216,A pleasant stay in a quirky guest house,"This establishment consists of two buildings - what used to be the coach house is now the entrance, with a super mid-C20th sunken lounge area complete with peat fire which gives a pleasant aroma.  The architecture is stunning.  If staying in the main (200 year old) house as I was, you then walk through a pretty garden and up a narrow staircase to enter the gracious old terraced house.  I was in room number 20 which was only up one flight of stairs - to stay near the top floor must involve a lot of climbing!  Staff were friendly but non-intrusive, breakfast was tasty.  Everything was a little worn around the edges but then so am I so it didn't bother me.  The garden was a particularly charming spot considering it's in the centre of town - a pleasant walk to the main attractions of this gorgeous city.",4,2014,06,15
216,"Comfortable, convenient and stylish B&B","This B&B hotel is backwards.  The original front, now the back, is a beautiful Georgian House on Fitzwilliam Place. The front is in a mews, and the one enters through a door in the garden wall and then into a stylish reworking of what was presumably the carriage house/stable.  This part of the building is very distinctive, with a large sunken seating area with a fireplace.  this part of the hotel was designed by a well known architect whose name escapes me just for the moment, but he did a good job.

There are a couple of rooms in this part of the hotel, but most are in the house itself, across a pleasant little garden form the front.  The style of this part is slightly kitsch Georgian, a tiny bit shabby, perhaps, but very comfortable and characterful.  We have stayed in one of the ground floor rooms, which is a very good size, and one at the top of the house, which was smaller, but adequate.  In both cases, the bathroom was well appointed with a decent shower.  The rooms have the usual mod cons.  A couple of botts of mineral water were provided.

Breakfast is taken upstairs in the front (or the back as was) of the hotel, and is excellent.  Fresh juice.Cereals, yog, fresh fruit, fresh compote, excellent breads and jams, very good full Irish, good eggs bendict, scrambled eggs with smoked slamon were a little solid, a pair of kippers (with poched eggs), the best i have had.  Tea ad infinitum (or filter coffee).  Communal tables, which is not really my idea of a good time at brek (or any other meal) but it works fine.

I believe that the proprietors have been at it for some time; they give the impression of knowing exactly what they are doing.  They are charmingly hospitable; tea and home made biccies were offered on arrival, and our daughter was given brekkie even though she wasn't staying there!  

The hotel is just off Leeson St South, just north of the canal, just south of St Stephen's Green.  Easy walking distance into downtown Dubin, such as it is, and convenient for the airport express bus service.  If you arrive by car, it will be taken away from you and parked (and returned on request).

I doubt that there is a better place to stay in Dublin, unless you require swimming pools, business centres and so on.",5,2014,06,08
216,Excellent Breakfast!,"Number 31 is a bit out of the way, but a comfortable and interesting place to stay with a great breakfast.  

Pros:  Great breakfast, comfortable room, nearby walk along the canal.

Cons:  Bit of a walk  to tourist sites.  Poor room Lighting - bedside lamps are difficult to read by, and no lights with room seating.

Be aware:  No elevator and access to some rooms have lots of stairs.",4,2014,06,07
216,Charming inside and out,"My daughter and I enjoyed our four night stay at Number 31 in late May. I arrived at 10 AM, after hours of flying, and was offered breakfast and coffee, then shown to my room where I took a nice long nap before my daughter arrived. Our elegant room was on the second floor, overlooking the road which had some noise because we left our window open night and day. I used ear plugs so the noise hardly bothered me, and I slept well in the very comfortable bed. We loved the delicious breakfast every morning. One thing we found annoying, however, was that other guests would ""save"" chairs for other members of their group, so a few times when we tried to sit in the ""outdoor"" area we were told that the available seats were being saved. I'm not sure if anything can be done about this, but it seems that all members of a group should either go to breakfast together or perhaps not sit together. Part of the joy of traveling is visiting with other guests. 

The location is also nice. The Georgian neighborhood seems safe and the colorful doors are lovely. We went to dinner once at Farm across the road and down a little, but most sightseeing and dinners took place in the city center, which is a twenty minute walk. The walk is great in the morning when your energy level is high, but after walking all day, it's kind of tiring to walk back to the city again, and then back to the hotel again after dinner. We resorted to taking a taxi a few times. This is an expensive option (about 12 euros each way) and if it rains the roads get congested (I thought it rained there all the time) and the taxi would end up taking longer than if we walked. So we would find a good place to get out and walk anyway, but at least we had a ride part way. We enjoyed taking the hop on hop off bus around the city one day.

The free wi-fi is handy, but there are four-word passwords that change daily, and every device needs a separate password every day. At the end of our stay, one of the staff said we should have been given a five day pass--this would have saved time, but we managed and were happy that it was free. The other hotels we stayed at in Ireland all had free wi-fi that was easy to access and once on, stayed on for the duration of the stay.  

On two of the four mornings during our stay, our room door was opened by housekeeping while we were still asleep. This woke us up, and frightened us slightly. One time it was at 8:30 and the other time was about 9:00 (we'd been out late at the pubs listening to music). The housekeeper might have knocked first, but we didn't hear a knock, only the door being opened and housekeeping saying ""sorry"". I travel often and have never had this happen before. My suggestion would be to put a ""do not disturb"" sign on the door if you prefer to sleep in a little.

Dublin is a beautiful city full of parks, gardens, museums, fun pubs and shopping. I especially loved the cemetery and botanical gardens, which sparkled under blue skies the day we visited. We loved our ten day stay in Ireland, and hope to return someday.",4,2014,06,06
216,"Charming host, scrumptious breakfast, great location",This beautiful home converted to a B&B had a fantastic location. Most comfortable Pillows! & bed. The room I stayed in was cramped but clean. The host was very helpful with a great disposition. Best Breakfast!!!,5,2014,06,05
216,"Great room, great breakfast, gracious host","While it's a bit further from the main tourist sights than we'd hoped, our room at this B&B (in the historic townhouse across the courtyard) was wonderful.  Breakfast featured cooked to order items and a buffet that left us set for the day!  Lots of recommendations (and reservations) for dining.  A perfect place to stay in Dublin.",5,2014,06,04
216,A great bed,"Nice location in a beautifull street. The owner is very, very frendly, breakfast is delicious, but a room at the 4th floor with no elevator? The room decoration was, to say the least ...no decoration!
But, the bed was great",3,2014,05,29
216,fantastic breakfast and huge warm welcome,"my  husband booked this as a birthday surprise for me.  
we only stayed 2 nights but it was just lovely.  After a journey of whatever length the first words of your hosts to anyone who arrives is hello and welcome, can I get you a tea or a coffee?  You are invited to sink into the large sunken lounge, in front of a real fire on colder days and browse the many and varied books on the coffee table while your host Noel or his wife fetch you a fresh cuppa accompanied by some gorgeous home baked goodies for a quick much needed, relaxing sugar fix!  Noel will then give you all the information you desire to enjoy your stay and make the most of your trip before showing you to your room,.
Our room was very comfortable - lovely super king sized bed, good quality bed linen and nice touch of bottled water beside the bed.  Quality furniture, great size, loads of storage and great hairdryer for ladies with long hair, where power is required!
Location is only 10 minutes stroll or 7 mins quick walk to St Stephens Park, and close to the aircoach  stop from the airport (just 35 mins journey time without any traffic) and breakfast was just fantastic.  So welcoming, friendly and fantastic fresh good quality.  Eggs benedict is especially good as is the huge selection of fresh fruit - you would not want to miss it.",5,2014,05,25
216,A wonderful place to stay . . .,"The Number 31 in Dublin is in a wonderful location -- you can walk almost anywhere in Dublin from this hotel -- and the breakfasts are the best in all of Ireland. One could not ask for better or more helpful staff, including the owner who is delightful, welcoming and very generous with his time and assistance.  And the hotel has a beautiful garden and breakfast rooms as well as a funky charm about it that makes it even more wonderful.  I only wish we had taken a slightly higher priced room that would have given us more space.  But that was our fault, and not the hotels.  I very much recommend the Number 31.",5,2014,05,20
216,Very Nice Stay!,"We stayed here mid April and where shown to our rooms and provided plenty of information for our stay.   The suggestion of eating dinner at Sussex was fantastic.  The breakfast was excellent and plenty of fresh fruit, try to get a seat in the sunroom!!   The host was very accommodating and helped me plan a picnic when driving over the Wicklow Mountains.  Others have said it is difficult to find, but using our GPS(Waze) it guided us right to the door.  Would have been excellent had is not been for a moldy smell in the fourth floor bathroom.  One advice for someone bothered by stairs is to request a room on the first floor.  These old buildings are not allowed to have an elevator.   Also, the lighting in the rooms is dim, so if you want to read a book in bed bring a light that can attach to your book.",4,2014,05,19
216,"stunning room, great location","We stayed in a main floor room overlooking the courtyard which was absolutely stunning!  We arrived later than expected and the gentleman who checked us in was very helpful in recommending and getting us a table at The Sussex, a great local restaurant within walking distance.  I was a bit concerned that the location of Number 31 was not close enough to town but found everything was within walking distance and the neighborhood was upscale and safe to walk in. Parking was free and they took car of our car for us, which was great.  Breakfast in  the morning was amazing!  The owner of the hotel also came out and told us some wonderful stories about the history of the place and the original owner/architect.  It was the perfect start to our trip though Ireland and I would return again.",5,2014,05,17
216,Hospitable hybrid,"Number 31 is not a hotel.  It's not a B&B.  What is it?  I'm not sure, but it's the perfect place to stay in Dublin.  The rooms have every comfort and the atmosphere is intimate, but not intrusive.   Host Noel will greet you like a long-lost relative.  Breakfast choices are endless and each dish is perfectly prepared.   I stayed there 10 years ago and was thrilled to find that it is still as delightful as I remembered.  Forget the chain hotels and go to Number 31.",5,2014,05,15
216,The Height of Hospitality,"If you want a lodging experience that combines warmth and elegance, look no further. The stylish modernist design feels both fresh and homey. The rooms are cozy yet sophisticated. Each night I lay in bed looking forward to the breakfast the next morning. Laid out before you in the bright, charming dining space is the most bountiful array: fresh squeezed orange juice, endless french press coffee, Irish breakfast tea, a table full of the most delicious cereals and fresh fruit, yogurt, granola, fresh baked bread, toast in its own porcelain rack so no two pieces touch one another (!!) homemade rhubarb compote, the list goes on... Menu items include eggs benedict with lemony hollandaise and peppery arugula, cheesy, fluffy fresh omelets, mushroom frittata, salmon scramble and more! When the server comes by and asks ""Is there anything else?"" you will be racking you brains to think of any other thing in the world you could possibly want. Anytime we are in Dublin, this is the place that we will stay. There is no where else like it. What really makes a stay here special is the service. If you need advice on anything the city has to offer, just ask and the owners will be happy to point you in a number of helpful directions. You will not regret a single part of your stay at this lovely establishment.  I only wished we could have stayed longer.",5,2014,05,12
216,"comfortable, hospitable and good location","I've been staying at Number 31 regularly on business for the last four months and I've chosen to do so because its such a comfortable and hospitable place to stay - and a far cry from the impersonal chain hotels.
Rooms: relatively simple by design, but warm, relatively well soundproofed (I never really heard any noise between the rooms) and the beds are extremely comfortable, showers excellent and all spotlessly clean. They're all different by the nature of the Georgean house that is Number31 but similarly styled. 
Breakfast: is really as good as it sounds and served in their bright breakfast room / conservatory. Lovely fresh fruit, tasty granola, delicious, fresh soda bread and an almost cake-like cranberry bread, together with a choice of different hot breakfasts, which have always been a joy. On occasions when I didn't have time to eat a cooked breakfast, the Number31 team almost seemed disappointed not to be able to fully share their warm Irish hospitality! My only complaint was that the the need to get into the office meant I never had time to enjoy at leisure...
Location: A great balance between being relatively centrally located but away from the real hubbub (about five minutes walk up to St Stephen's Green and probably around 20 mins from the Aviva stadium, for example). Number31 is actually located on the border between central Dublin and a very affluent residential area, that includes a lot of embassies and very smart houses.
I'd certainly stay here when not on business.",5,2014,04,22
216,Perfect!,"Eleven of us stayed here two nights; my Dad, and my family of five(2 adults, 3 kids) and my sisters family of 5. My Dad has mobility issues, and Noel accommodated him in a garden level room, even bringing him tea and biscuits to his room on a rainy afternoon, when Dad didn't  feel like going out! The rooms were fantastic, gorgeous buildings(2 buildings with a ""secret"" garden that connects them). It's not easy to find hotels that accommodate families in Dublin; stay here! The location is great, about a ten minute walk to Trinity College, the shops, etc.The breakfasts were wonderful, the staff was just out of this world, and Noel you made us feel so at home! ....on a side note, the Restaurant ""The Sussex"" Noel recommended was awesome, we ate there both nights!

216,Fantastic place to stay!,"We recently visited Dublin as a family and stayed at Number 31.  Noel and his team were wonderful hosts.  They were gracious, offered tips on places to visit and eat and overall provided us with interesting conversation.  The location was central and the accommodations and breakfasts, delightful and delicious.  We would stay there again and again.  Highly recommended!",5,2014,03,30
216,Cracking stay,"Had a very enjoyable stay at Number 31. You were immediately made to feel very welcome with tea and home made biscuits and they were happy for you to check in early. We were able to move rooms as we wanted to be in one of the high ceiling rooms and it was no issue. The Irish breakfast was amazing and very good service. Only thing I would say is that our initial room was a little tired, but it does have charm!",4,2014,03,25
216,"Elegant, welcoming","I met my daughter for a mother/daughter trip to Ireland in December 2008.  We had a hard time finding Number 31, don't know if it was us or just hard to find.  When we finally arrived Noel, our host, warmly welcomed us, offered us tea.  We went out for our first Guinness and also went to a wonderful wine bar.  Apparently we were jet lagged because we slept 12 hours in one of the most comfortable beds ever!  We had a delicious full irish breakfast the next morning.  Our rental car tire had a slow leak and, having no idea how to get around, Noel was kind of enough to drive the car to get air in the tire for us.  He also recommended a more logical route for heading south due to being in winter and having less daylight.  Very helpful and welcoming.",5,2014,03,17
216,Excellent experience,Noel and his wife were fabulous hosts!  We were able to walk everywhere in Dublin from this location.  Stayed for a week and the breakfast was always fresh and delicious.  We had a very spacious room with a big comfortable bed.  I believe it was in the building across the courtyard from the main house where the breakfast is served.  I would go back in a heartbeat!,5,2014,03,05
216,"Elegant, sumptuous and delightfully welcoming","Number 31 is decadent but not over-stated, exquisitely decorated and architecturally spectacular. When you discover it was owned my architect Sam Stephenson, and was THE place to party if you were an American vice-President in the 1960s, everything seems to make sense...

That large, oak door with 31 on it, tucked on the right of what is half a driveway and half a small business estate? Use the intercom there to let the charming owners know you're there. You'll be welcomed into a white stone walled room, warmly lit, with Moorish and Mediterranean themes, a sunken square packed with plush cushions, then invited to take coffee and cookies. You'll not find yourself in a rush to get to your room. The beautifully-maintained courtyard, thick walls, more tourism guides than you could ever read and Molton Brown hand crème... 

The hotel's friendly assistant, Sam, opened the door to room number 21 and it was breath-taking. The sort of space you would never, ever expect in a city-centre hotel. Moreover, never expect in anything marketed as a boutique hotel. The 6ft double turned out to be two separate mattresses and the Ikea-looking wardrobe and chest of drawers were a bit out of place, if you're a stickler for interiors, but the sunflower shower, black-tiled bathroom, metallic artwork, floor-to-ceiling windows and heavy curtains were just totally luxurious. 

Many reviewers here have raved about the breakfasts and rightfully so. This morning, it was served outside, in a heated courtyard and the selection (eggs benedict, mushroom frittata, very cheesy omelette and of course full Irish) was plentiful. More coffee than you can consume in a week, fresh orange and a great buffet of exotic and fresh fruits, cereals and compotes just added to support how deserving it is of its reputation. 

The quality is superior and the welcome extremely warm. I've previously stayed in the Westbury, off Grafton Street, which although stunning, is not an experience and lacks that personal touch. I'll certainly be back.",5,2014,03,04
216,Elegant and suave,"A Georgian terraced house and its mews house are elegantly joined through a small garden.  Dublin' s a charming city to explore, if on a break, by foot and bus. And this is a wonderful, calm base from which to explore or escape back.  The great breakfasts are rightly lauded, but the atmosphere is elegant, the service suave, the feeling discreet.  Not for all but we loved it and just relaxed.  Offers of tea and coffee at any time were neatly reassuring.  ",5,2014,02,16
216,Like having a home in Dublin,"Our group (two families of four) was treated to the most wonderful time by Noel and his staff.  Our rooms were in the historic and architecturally significant main house and were spectacular and comfortable.   The main lounge and dining room felt like a wonderful extension of our space, and we enjoyed sitting in the sunken couch area by the turf fire.  Breakfast lives up to its excellent reputation.  The private garden and entrance are very well kept, and the location of the hotel is convenient for exploring Dublin by foot.
Thank you, Noel for taking such great care of us.  We'll be back!
Dave & Kim",5,2014,02,09
216,Boutique interior and breakfast. And you pay for it.,"The lady of the house has a refined taste and did a wonderful job decorating the B&B. Breakfasts are a feast for the eye and the stomach and they're proud for it.
They also know it, so you're paying every single inch in hard cash, making it quite expensive... compared to ...nothing of this standard in Dublin.
An experience for once.",4,2014,02,01
216,Delightful,"Situated down a small road off Leeson Street and close to the Grand canal, Number 31 has  impressive doors in contrast to the surroundings. Once inside you are transported into a different world of comfort and seclusion. The lounge area has a sunken central feature (the seats are getting very worn) with an extensive library of guides to Dublin and the surrounding area. The reception and breakfast area is upstairs. Through a small garden you enter the large Georgian building to the rear where many of the rooms are situated. Mine was very well fitted with a small but pleasant sitting room, a really comfortable bed and a very modern bathroom. Number 31 is renowned for its breakfasts and you will be amazed by the depth of the menu. Situated as it is close to the heart of Dublin, you won't be disappointed if you want something different from the usual hotel chain. The staff could not have been more welcoming or helpful. A definite must.",5,2014,01,24
216,"Wonderful, Unique - not sure how to classify - guesthouse/boutique hotel","Have stayed at Number 31 on a number of occasions.  Its unique - much more personal than a hotel, much more upmarket than a B&B.  Rooms all quite individually designed and most are quite spacious.  Very centrally located close to city centre but wonderfully quiet.  Breakfast has also been consistently wonderful.  Good Man Noel !",4,2014,01,17
216,Wonderful and welcoming stay,"We stayed at Number 31 over New Year and very much enjoyed our stay. The hosts were very welcoming and brought us tea to our room, which was very much appreciated while we settled in. Our room was right off the entrance, but we never heard anyone coming or going, so it felt very private. Breakfast was generous and delicious, especially the eggs benedict, which we enjoyed both mornings on the back sun porch. We very much enjoyed our stay and will stay at again!",5,2014,01,09
216,Good location,well located just down from St Stephens Green. We have stayed there before and really enjoyed it.  Good standard throughout. Friendly welcome but the only problem was that we asked them to repair the light in the bathroom but they didn't manage to do it in the 2 days we stayed there. Disappointing - would like the practicalities done as well as the bonhomie.,4,2013,12,31
216,Quitely Surprising Hotel with fabulous breakfast,"On arrival in Leeson Close, there is a closed doorway with no obvious clues that you have reached your hotel.  Press the buzzer and the door opens.  Go through the small courtyard and up a few steps.  Enter into a small passageway and turn right.  The reception may be empty, but wait, somebody will greet you!  There is a sunken area with settees and a big fireplace.  The whitewashed walls give a feeling that you are in Marrakech rather than Dublin.  Once greeted, your rooms will be either in this building or a short walk through the back, across the courtyard into another separate building.  I was in room 19 ground floor - wow this room was big with very interesting light fittings.  It was lovely and warm - but no tea or coffer facilities in the room which was a shame.  There were complimentary bottles of water and you could go back to reception for free tea or coffee, but, after a long day I didn't want to venture out again.  Breakfast was exceptionally good, and the choices were excellent.  The full Irish was cooked to perfection and the fruit selection was as good as anywhere.  There was a really nice welcome and attention to detail was with everything, including the understated Christmas decorations in the breakfast room.  The staff were really friendly and I would definitely recommend this hotel.  The location is also very good for the central Dublin areas.",4,2013,12,16
216,Almost Like Being Wealthy,"It was easy to feel as if we ""belonged"" in this area full of Georgian style buildings with brightly painted doors. Finding No. 31 wasn't easy (but the cabbie was in charge) since it's off the main street just a bit. It proved to be a perfect location for walking in the very walkable Dublin area we were interested in. It has two parts, one is more modern (a converted artist studio/coach house I heard) and the other is an older Georgian mansion. We were on an upper floor of the latter and I think the flights of stairs we had to climb were good for us, but if that's an issue then request a lower floor. The breakfasts were as good as everyone says. It's funny that they have the same things on the menu as lots of places (full Irish breakfast, etc.), but theirs are so much better prepared--eggs cooked just right, even the porridge was delicious--lots of really fresh fruit, etc.). The place is on several levels, however, so as I said, if stairs are a problem you should check with them first. Highly recommended.",5,2013,12,09
216,Perfect Place to Stay,"This place is so so lovely! It's a little bit outside of the heart of the city, which worked out perfectly for getting away after a very busy day of sightseeing. From the moment you walk in through the wooden doors you're so welcomed. I stayed here with my sister recently and our stay was clearly not long enough, I just want to go back already! Our room was spacious and our beds were so comfortable you could barely sit on them without wanting to rest for days. Breakfast was amazing! I could have eaten it all day and still not have had enough! I recommend this place to everyone",5,2013,12,05
216,Great Experience,"I recently took a trip to Dublin and was lucky enough to have discovered Number 31 on the internet beforehand! A bit hard to find for the taxi driver, but once you step through the large wooden gate/door it's lovely! Beautiful building and the room was very nice, bed was most comfortable bed I have ever slept in bar my own! The breakfast the next morning had to be eaten to be believed! Beautiful berries, cereals and fruits to start then the cooked breakfast. I opted for the eggs benedict on both mornings as it was just delicious. The eggs poached perfectly with amazing hollandaise and a magical little potato cake which was melt in the mouth. I have no doubt that the other options on the menu would have been equally delicious. I found all the staff very genuinely friendly and very welcoming - I would recommend Number 31 wholeheartedly and look forward to when I can next get back to visit!!",5,2013,12,04
216,Fabulous ,"Everything was perfect, the breakfast was scrumptious, I got a warm welcome, the room was lovely. The staff were very nice. It's a great place to stay as it's located in town which made it easy for me to do some clothes shopping. Also I would recommend this B&B to all of my friends, will stay again.",5,2013,11,21
216,Really enjoyed our stay here,The hospitality here was terrific.  We showed up early and were welcomed with open arms.  Gave us a wonderful hot breakfast even before we checked in.  Our room was spotless and spacious and the hosts went out of their way to make us feel at home.   We very much enjoyed our stay here and would book here again.,5,2013,11,19
216,Friendly atmosphere and great breakfast!,"I sojourned here for one night on a business trip. Was lovely to arrive and be served a nice cup of coffee in the beautiful reception with burning logs. Architecturally impressive, central to all locations and very comfortable rooms with great hot showers. Slightly pricey but definitely worth it!",4,2013,11,12
216,Warm Welcome and Fantastic Breakfast,"My nephew recently completed the Dublin City Marathon and we were fortunate to get two family rooms the night before the marathon and the next night.  The proximity of the guesthouse meant my nephew had just to walk out the front door to where the marathon commenced.  We waved off our nephew and went back into the guesthouse and had a fantastic breakfast (which kept us going all day) - we were also given  take- away coffee/tea to enjoy while we shouted on the runners.  The service was truely exceptional both from the owner Noel, the waiting staff and the chef who cooked our gorgeous breakfast, it was very busy but the service was still  top class.  I would recommend no 31 to all my friends and I will definitely be returning in the not too distant future.",5,2013,11,11
216,Marvellous!,"What a find! Yes, I know, I am repeating what other reviewers said, but what can I do? It's true!

This is a gem of a place on so many levels: fabulous design (the super-wow 70s mews/reception/lounge/breakfast area with open fire, the warmly and elegantly modernised Georgian bedrooms, the in-between garden), fabulous service (friendly and confident, not in the least overbearing but genuinely there for you as/when you need it), fabulous breakfast (everything you could possibly want, and all excellent quality), super-dooper comfort and mod cons (those beds!! great bathrooms/shower, free wifi, great storage space for all your stuff, super armchairs...)

Location is very good - just south of centre, in an area of gorgeous Georgian townhouses. Not much to do in immediate surrounding, but a 10 min walk to the glorious St Stephen's green and another 5 to Trinity College, Temple Bar and the river.

The website doesn't do the place justice, you know - it is better than that. And I am kicking myself for forgetting to take pictures of the room... only communal areas.

And all for THOSE prices! I mean, seriously. I am trying to conjure up a reason to go back to Dublin so I can stay there again, even as I write this...",5,2013,11,08
216,What a find!,"From the moment we walked through the door at Number 31, a beautiful Georgian townhouse guesthouse, the owner Noel, made us feel more like family than guests.  His Irish warmth and hospitality made us feel like we were staying at a home away from home.   Number 31 is conveniently located and our room was spacious and beautifully appointed.   The enclosed terrace area where breakfast was served was a lovely way to begin each day and the breakfast itself was absolutely amazing!  

With all of that, there is no doubt where we will be staying the next time we are in Dublin!",5,2013,11,05
216,Fantastic!,"Just come back from a night stay with my wife and had to just come on here to heartily recommend this hotel to any and everyone....every facet, simply fantastic!

This place will live long in our memory and we will definitely be coming back",5,2013,11,03
216,Breakfast and service,"Stayed for 2 nights and had the best stay in Dublin. The place itself is unique and very pleasant.
The room was very cosy and the bathroom had a great power shower! The staff are super friendly and the breakfast out of this world...great choice of food which is fresh and beautifully tasty...I would highly recommend it for short and long stays",5,2013,10,29
216,Lovely place,"Had a fantastic weekend the entire family at Number 31 - after having been there on a previous business related visit just 6 months ago. Warm, welcoming and friendly staff with great recommendations for local restaurants and places to see. Absolutely fantastic breakfast and Comfortable beds. Very personal and different to standard ""hotels"". Would definitely recommend this place!",5,2013,10,27
216,No no no to Number 31,Upon arrival we were seated in the conversation pit and given coffee and cake.  I thought we were going to be in for a really enjoyable stay but unfortunately this was not so for us.  We were shown to our room being front street level through the garden.  We were assured the traffic would not be a problem after 7pm.  We had to sleep with the window closed due to the noise both nights we were there.  The room itself was dark (I could not see to put my make-up on) there was no toilet roll holder and the toilet seat was broken.  The shower flooded the bathroom floor.  I think the price we paid was excessive - this so called establishment is overrated and over priced.  The breakfast was adequate and the staff were friendly.  We would not recommend Number 31 to our friends.,2,2013,10,23
216,AWESOME! AWESOME!,"The coziness, the hospitality, the breakfast, the tea and cookies upon arriving, the extremely comfortable beds, and the service made for a wonderful stay. We had a room across the courtyard/garden on the bottom floor facing the street. Had no problems sleeping. There were 3 of us. Quite spacious. Got to see the best sights and restaurants, thanks to Adam. I would return in a heartbeat. One suggestion: It's hard to find. It's tucked in a place you wouldn't expect. It reminds of the book My Secret Garden......and they have a lovely one.",5,2013,10,16
216,Fanstastic boutique hotel!,"Beautiful property just south of the city center.  Close to everything, but a bit off the beaten tourist path.  Charming staff with great recommendations for local restaurants.  Absolutely fantastic breakfast!  Nice sitting area with lots of books and a fireplace near the front door.  We were sorry to leave and would definitely return.",5,2013,10,15
216,Lovely,We were welcomed early and enjoyed a much needed delicious full breakfast. Our bags were stored since we were so early. The room was lovely and comfortable. The restaurant recommendations were awesome too!! Loved it!,5,2013,10,09
216,Perfect hideaway in Dublin,"What a find! Number 31 is in a perfect, central location. Our room, just one floor up, was lovely and quiet. While I understand some people's comments to the effect that they would have preferred a more formal reception desk (there isn't one), our welcome was warm and helpful. As soon as we rang the bell someone was there to offer us tea and cookies, and help us to our room with our bags.   Innkeeper Lowell couldn't have been nicer and his suggestions for what to do in Dublin - including places we otherwise would not have seen - were spot on.  And the advertised ""best breakfast in Ireland"" is no exaggeration-fantastic.  We would absolutely stay here again, anytime we're lucky enough to return to Dublin.",5,2013,10,08
216,All But the Towels,"On our drive in from the airport our wonderful taxi driver told us that she's heard from a number of her passengers about how wonderful Number 31 is, especially the breakfast. Well we certainly weren't disappointed. We loved the fact that the hotel is about a 10-15 minute walk to the center of the city. Breakfast were wonderful and the staff was happy to give us advise as to our days activities. As another reviewer noted you had to get your questions answered at breakfast as it was not always easy to find staff. If climbing stairs is a problem you should ask for a first floor room as there are not elevators (at least that we saw). Our only complaint was the towels...thin and not soft. Small bath towels. We would definitely stay there again.",4,2013,10,08
216,Wonderful experience--can't say enough,"We were delighted to receive a warm greeting and a welcoming warm breakfast on our early arrival here a couple weeks ago.  It only got better from there.  We booked a superior room and were not disappointed.  We stayed 5 nights in Room 20 in the Georgian house and another night at the end of our Ireland trip in Room 21 or 22?.  Both rooms were spacious, beautifully designed and well appointed.  The public areas and garden between the modern and Georgian rooms are strikingly beautiful.  Breakfast each morning was a special treat, cooked to order, with a lavish buffet of fruits, cereals, and yogurt as well. Noel and Linda and their staff are friendly and eager to accommodate in any way, whether serving coffee or tea near the fragrant fireplace in the cozy sunken lounge, arranging taxis, sharing tips on restaurants, or highlighting nearby points of interest.  This is a very special place to stay in Dublin and a highlight of our trip--especially good for beginning and ending a trip to Ireland on a high note.",5,2013,09,29
216,Perfection!!,"I recently enjoyed my second stay at Number 31 with my wife for our anniversary and again we were blown away. It is like a little jewel in the centre of Dublin. If you are fed up with large hotels lacking in character and customer service then I urge you to book into Number 31. 

The rooms are lovely and the buildings both on Leeson Close and Fitzwilliam Square are beautiful (award winning architecture). You are right on the edge of St. Stephen's Green so we were able to walk to The Gaiety Theatre no problem (wife in heels!).

The highlight again was the breakfast (also award winning...plaques to prove it!!) and the host, Noel. As we sat for breakfast we were given freshley squeezed orange juice and fresh coffee along with artisan breads. Noel then serenades you with the menu (verbal..no need for menu cards here, the staff are too good at their job for that at Number 31) which includes the full irish, the mushroom fritata, eggs benedict (beautiful) and he never forgets the ""little bowl of porridge"". As you wait all you can here is everyone praising their breakfast and sharing their particular choice with their family. This doesn't happen in any other hotel I have stayed in!

Give the plastic hotels a miss and book Number 31 the next time you are in Dublin. Don't worry about parking either. They provide secure, free car parking.",5,2013,09,27
216,lovely place/owners: some flaws,"we enjoyed our stay here: lovely , warm owners who love what they do and friendly staff.
Rooms vary greatly in size and comfort and noise level from the street: ask for quiet room away from street if you are noise sensitive at night
fabulous breakfasts with lots of hot choice and cold choices (especially fruit)
One issue if you want help after breakfast time: rarely could find anyone to assist with reservations, etc other than at breakfast. No one at front desk
More of a B&B than a hotel if that is important to you
otherwise, good location for walking around",4,2013,09,18
216,Outstanding oasis in a busy Dublin,"My family of 4, including two teenage boys had the pleasure of staying at Number 31 in Dublin this past July .  Everything about this hotel exceeded our expectations. From the exceptionally warm  welcome by the owners Noel and Linda who arranged to whisk away our bags, parked our car and offered us coffee or tea to when we were shown our lovely rooms. The rooms although compact are well planned with everything in the right place. Lovely sheets and well appointed bathroom. The hotel spans two buildings with a garden in the middle which is a lovely spot to organize your day or end it with a glass of wine. In the morning we were served a truly Award winning Irish Breakfast that was delicious and more than satisfied our two big hungry teenagers. Noel was very helpful in terms of tips on where to go on our touring days . His dinner recommendations were perfect and they were all within walking distance. If you get a chance to chat with Noel I would recommend it as has a wealth of knowledge on Irish history and politics. All and all one of the best stays we had in our 2 week holiday in Ireland. We would definitely include this hotel on a return trip .",5,2013,09,17
216,Great place to stay,"My friends and I stayed in a family room at Number 31 from Sept 9-14, 2013.  The hotel is located a short walk (10-15) minutes from many main attractions in Dublin.  The owners are very friendly and helpful, giving good recommendations on where to eat and making reservations for us as necessary.  The room was a good size with 4 twin beds (as requested), a sitting room and a good size washroom.  The hotel has a social sitting area where you can meet other guests seated by the fireplace.  There is a good WiFi connection in this sitting area, but you need a voucher to use WiFi in your room.  The owners or staff can provide the vouchers.",5,2013,09,17
216,Fabulous place!,"My husband and I stayed at Number 31 for one night to celebrate his birthday and my graduation. Upon arrival (if you get there before 10am you can join them for breakfast) we were immediately warmly welcomed by Noel and Linda and whisked straight through to a wonderful breakfast while we waited for our room to be ready. It was my husband birthday that day, and they surprised him with a birthday cake and fizz which went down very well! The room itself was beautiful and luxurious with a very comfortable bed. All of the staff we met made us feel right at home and nothing was too much for them; they made excellent restaurant and sight-seeing recommendations, offered endless tea and coffee and were easy going and easy to chat to. Can't recommend this place highly enough and will definitely be back for a return visit!",5,2013,09,16
216,Gorgeous Property...Excellent Breakfast...Tough to Find...Get Fit for Climbing the Stairs,"For the final night of our two week honeymoon adventure in Ireland, we booked a room at Number 31. This was one of only two nights we booked in advance…as we hoped to make our final night in Ireland something a little unique and different. After two weeks at a wide range of properties ranging from the Ritz Carlton to cozy little B&Bs…we were intrigued by the reviews for this “boutique inn.” Unfortunately, the stay got off poorly…so I am trying not to let that inappropriately influence my overall rating. We had been on the road all day having left Westport in the morning and spending the day driving through Cong, Doolough Valley, Lough Nafooey and on to Dublin. We fired up the GPS to find Number 31 and looked forward to check in. Long story short…we drove around Dublin for an hour looking for Number 31. The GPS appropriately delivered us to what appeared to be an alley way with no apparent sign (literal or figurative) of our destination, so we kept driving around. After driving around for an hour…we finally decided to ring the bell at a large, nondescript door on the alleyway. Surprise! It was where we needed to be. Chris welcomed us and helped us carry our many bags through the main building, across a dark courtyard, into another building and then up, up, up, and up some more stairs to the top floor where our room was located. Whew. Thank goodness we are in shape. The décor is incredible throughout….tremendous care and resources have definitely been invested in decorating this very cool property. Our room was nicely decorated, the bed very comfy and the bathroom nicely equipped. We received some great tips for a late dinner and headed out to get nourished. There were several good restaurants within walking distance...and we ended up having one of the best meals during our trip (Canal Café). When we returned, we tried to find the “front entrance” to Number 31, however could find it…no signage out front and we simply couldn’t remember which door we exited. We travelled around back and navigated our way back up, up, and up to our room. Sleeping was a little tough despite the lovely bed…given the noise out on the street. Lots of partying going on outside until after 4am. We closed the window to try and get some quiet but you could still hear the noise. In the morning we headed over to breakfast….which was incredible. Cheese omelet and full Irish breakfast were amazing….best we had while in Ireland. We settled up and headed out for the airport. Overall the staff were extremely friendly, the room was lovely, the food was awesome….but trying to find Number 31 was an adventure.",3,2013,09,15
216,Disappointed in Boutique Hotel Experience,"I quickly read the reviews before writing mine and another from smb485 on 27 August seems to have mirrored my experience exactly! I also decided for my final night in Ireland to book a lovely boutique hotel which seemed to have great reviews and I was excited by the 'best breakfast' award. Unfortunately I had issues from the moment I arrived. First of all I arrived in the laneway and had to ring the bell to get in (it wasn't very clear what to do with the locked door?). The person who arrived was quite lovely and took me to the lounge and offered tea and biscuits. These were great but then he disappeared and I had no idea where to find him again (there is no reception, only a desk with broshures which looks like a reception and their office is behind the kitchen - more on that later). Another person arrived who had already taken my very large suitcase to my room. He did ask if he could take my other smaller backpack as we would need to go up 4 floors and at this point I really should have said I had a lung condition - very bad of me so I can't blame them for that). Needless to say the trip to the other building up 4 floors of stairs just about did me in and took around half an hour to recover.

I went out for dinner and they advised that there was a door to this other building from the road but didn't say what the number (it's 32 and has a sign to some company??) was so I got confused on the way back and had to double-back and enter via the back laneway again. Did I mention the half hour recovery after walking up the stairs. The room also doesn't have a fridge so my water was hot and of little help. The day was also quite hot and being up the top of the building meant an even more hotter and stuffier room (no fan for me). I opened the window but with the heavy curtain it didn't help much at night. It also faced the roadway which I'm pretty sure every garbage truck or the like felt the need to drive up at all times of the night and early morning. I think I only got around 1 hour sleep the whole night.

In terms of other features, the bed was fine and comfortable but the bathroom needs work. The toilet paper holder didn't exist (was on a vertical holder on the ground), one of the towel hooks was broken, the shower head was lilting to the side (and was too big for the tiny cubicle) and water leaked all over the floor. By the time I repacked my suitcase and dragged it down the 4 floors to the lobby (I left it there as I didn't want to drag it to the other building to checkout), I didn't have much time for breakfast but thankfully they were able to accommodate me with quick toast and bacon (so I didn't get to try the award winning breakfast to its potential but to be fair this was my issue and others seemed happy with it). To check-out I actually had to walk through the kitchen (where they were cooking breakfast) to the office. This was pretty simple though.

Obviously I have different views of a boutique hotel and I expect for the money to receive the comfort of an elevator and air-conditioning. Perhaps I should have complained at the time but I've always found this hard to do. I do still think they need to look at maintenance though to keep up to standard.",2,2013,09,09
216,Come for comfort stay for breakfast,"In August of this year, four of us girls shared a room in this beautiful B&B located near St. Stephens Green.  The room was spacious and comfortable, the staff was great.  Location very close to many pubs and restraunts.  The breakfast was outstanding!  Would definitely come back again (and in fact one of our party did return for another night the following week.",5,2013,09,09
216,Such a Treat,"It was such a treat to stay at Number31.  A little difficult to find but we'll worth the effort. We arrived tired after our flight only to find tea and cookies on our arrival.  It really hit the spot.  Breakfast each morning was wonderful and the company was interesting and varied.  All of us visiting Ireland for different reasons.  The staff was so helpful answering our many questions, making recommendations and overall we felt like we were home.",5,2013,09,09
216,What a delight!,"Stayed for three nights and enjoyed three fabulous breakfasts!  Decor is lovely and it is clean with large rooms and gorgeous bathrooms. The garden was a little oasis away from the busy city.  Nolan the owner and all the staff were friendly and helpful.  Enjoyed tea and biscuits upon our arrival. Great location within walking distance of grafton street, trinity, the galleries and museums.  The Internet access was difficult but didn't detract at all from the overall delight.",5,2013,09,03
216,Exceeded our expectations,"I chose this guesthouse after reading all the great reviews on Trip Advisor and we found it to be all and more than we anticipated. Our room was lovely, we were thrilled to see there was a fan in the room as we had heard that the warm summer made for an uncomfortable night in establishments without air conditioning.  The decor was brilliant, the bed a dream and the breakfasts scrumptious. Nothing was too much trouble for our lovely hosts - they made us feel at home.   If we ever return to Dublin we would not contemplate staying anywhere else. Location brilliant, easy to walk to most attractions and very close to some lovely restaurants.",5,2013,09,02
216,Excellent place in Dublin,"We had a wonderful time in Dublin, made all the better by how lovely and relaxed our stay was at Number 31!  The location is great - within walking distance of most Dublin attractions. The service is wonderful, breakfast delicious, and the rooms so interesting with a mix of old and new features. Would love to return.",5,2013,09,02
216,Warm welcome,"We arrived early at the hotel and were warmly welcomed and invited to breakfast.  When finished, our room was ready for us. Noel gave us wonderful tips on what to do and see.  We followed much of his advice and were never disappointed.  Everyone has different expectations but this was perfect for us.  We love the charm and personal attention.  Bathroom could have been bigger but oh well.  We would definitely stay there again.",5,2013,09,02
216,Expectations,"We all have varying senses of what we want, what we need, what we get and how satisfying that all is.  Personal choice and personal satisfaction.  It is hard to tell someone what they should like.  We arrived at Number 31 after 20 hours of overnight travel from Australia.  We were greeted by Noel and taken straight to a late breakfast of sumptuous proportion, quality and taste, prior to checking into our room.  The room was spacious tasteful and extemely comfortable.  The hotel is located within walking distance of interesting neighbourhood things plus easy distance to central Dublin highlights.  Staff were helpful, charming and caring.  This is what we wanted, what was needed and what was delivered.  Could not have been more satisfied.  Thank you again.",4,2013,08,29
216,Expensive and overrated,"Having traveled all summer, I decided to treat myself to a nicer hotel at Number 31. I was looking forward to my stay, but I was extremely disappointed. The hotel itself is finely furnished, and I'm sure a lot of money went into the decor. However, the location, the food, and the service fell far from my expectations. 

Number 31 is difficult to find and while it is close to Stephen's Green, it is certainly a walk to the rest of the attractions in the city. Finally, I was in the building detached from the main entrance. Little did I know that the street my window faced is quite busy all night long. I heard foot traffic until 3:00am -- mostly drunken shenanigans -- both Friday and Saturday night. 

Again, based on reviews, I was looking forward to a hearty breakfast; I was sorely disappointed. The supposedly delicious cranberry nut loaf was dried out, and the fruit selection was overripe. 

For my three nights there, only one staff member introduced himself, and while he did carry my luggage up the four flights of stairs when I checked in, no one offered to help me with my luggage upon check out. When I scheduled a wake up call, it appeared to be an inconvenience, and when the call came at 6:00am, the caller simply hung up. No good morning or acknowledgment. 

I think Number 31 has great potential as a boutique hotel, but I was disappointed, and I hope others will be able to save some money and choose another place to stay in Dublin.",1,2013,08,27
216,"Fabulous breakfast, some disappointments","We recently had a three night stay at Number 31.  The breakfasts were out of this world and the staff during the day were very helpful and attentive.  The location was close to Stephen's Green.  After arriving, Noel warmly greeted us and invited us to breakfast which was very appreciated after an overseas flight.  He gave us a map and many tips about what to see and do in Dublin. Noel took us to our room, carried our bags up 4 flights of steep stairs in the old Georgian house.  Number 31 is beautifully furnished but the stairs are really a disadvantage, especially since North Americans tend to have suitcases and not carry-on luggage (departure was arduous, dragging the suitcases down the stairs).  For the steep price which we paid, the room was very small, the bathroom even smaller.  Ours overlooked the street and we were ""treated"" to construction noise on two of the three nights, once until 1 a..m. We guessed that there are no noise laws.  The night staff did not respond when we phoned the main desk two times to express our concerns. The construction was obviously out of their hands, but it did not complement our stay.",3,2013,08,25
216,"Great location, friendly staff","We recently had a 2 night stay in a family room.  We received a fantastic welcome from Noel and were quickly invited in to have brekfast which was very welcome after an overnight flight from the states.  After brekfast (wonderful by the way), we were given a great map and orientation to the area.  We left our bags and took off for the day.  When we returned we happily found our belongings in the room ready for us.  Our room was very large and had great beds and linens.  The stay was very nice and I would not hesitate to visit again.  Only two minor complaints, it was a bit pricy for our family budget (we had 7 nights in Kerry for less than 2 at Number 31, not a fair comparrison, but just for reference) and the water pressure was much lower that what we are accomstomed to at home.  The water pressure was not good everywhere we stayed though, so this is probably out of their control.  Nevertheless, stay at Number 31, you will love it.",4,2013,08,23
216,Disappointing,"I have stayed in Dublin a lot for work, however I was going with my husband on vacation so we wanted to try something different than a chain hotel.  After reading the reviews, we decided to book Number 31.  Like some of the reviews have said, it is hard to find.  When we finally found it,  we had a very warm and friendly greeting and this seemed like a great sign.  

As described, they have the Swedish Hästens beds that are super comfy.  The problem is that they take up a huge part of the room making it difficult to decide where to put your suitcase.  Additionally, we had spider webs in both our room and bathroom making me wonder about the overall effectiveness of the cleaning staff.  

Personally, we did not think this was the best breakfast in Dublin (try the Hilton a few blocks away on the canal for a comparable if not better breakfast).  I would not stay at the hotel again as frankly, I found it difficult to find a staff member to help out with something especially during the breakfast time when they were swamped. Also, when I asked about local restaurants that did take away for my ill husband, the clerk was not at all helpful and rather condescending.",3,2013,08,20
216,Amazing breakfast,"Stayed for one night and cannot speak highly enough of the incredible breakfast. The service provided was also outstanding. The hosts were extremely helpful and provided many ideas of child friendly activities to fill the days. 
The location is perfect close to many sites and restaurants.
Unfortunately we stayed during the Irish heatwave and the building was really hot, and is clearly designed to keep the heat in, which would normally be ideal. However, we did not get much sleep due to the heat, but this is my only gripe and ordinarily would not be an issue.

216,(num,"Number 31 is a unique hotel in a location convenient to many sites in Dublin.  Our room (number 46) was very comfortable and large, but the bathroom was a bit cramped.  All of the staff were wonderful and Noel and Hannah were very helpful.  Breakfasts were eggcellent!  Poached eggs every morning!  We very close to St Stephen's Green, Grafton Street, Trinity College, and so many other sites.  Can't wait to visit again!",4,2013,08,12
216,Home away from home!,"A great cozy location in a busy city. Rooms are comfortable but the service and breakfast set it apart!  A little hard to find so make sure to have directions. Noel, the proprietor, was first class. When we could not find the hotel, he personally came and found us.  We also needed to return our rental car and not knowing the city! Noel insisted personally once again getting is there and waiting almost an hour!  Staff is very knowledgable about the city.  A few great pubs/restaurants close by and other sites were an easy and pretty walk 15 minutes away",5,2013,08,08
216,SO much better than an hotel!,"We have stayed in number 31 several times and in our view it should called Number 1, cos that's what it is.  Noel is the consummate host and all the staff are friendly, helpful and good at their jobs.  The rooms are restful and well-furnished and the beds super-comfortable.  Sure, it's a bit noisy (traffic and nocturnal seagulls!) but it is a city centre hotel....what do you expect?  The location is excellent too.  We'll be back!",5,2013,08,06
216,Big disappointment,"We reserved a deluxe double room (220euro) and had high expectations after reading the rates in tripadvisor. We arrived in the evening and met a lady who seemed to be in a hurry to finish her day. After a few minutes came  Chris and took us to our room. This was a shock- without any notice he took us up the stairs-4 floors! We were carrying part of the bags and by the time we arrived the room on the top we had no breath. He gave us the key without even opening the door. We entered and found ourself in a tiny room facing the noisy street.
It took us less than a minute to decide to leave the place and go to another hotel. We went down the 4 floors, this time no one helped us with our suitcase and we struggled by ourself.
This was the worst experience we had in ireland",2,2013,08,05
216,"Great place, great staff","Noel and the rest of the staff were amazing.  We were so fortunate to have chosen this lovely place to stay.  The breakfast could be the best in Ireland.  The rooms were fantastic and comfortable.  They were extremely accommodating in every way, including booking us great restaurants for dinner!!!  We felt a great connection here and will miss them!  Highly recommend!!!",5,2013,08,04
216,What can I say....,"We didn't get to meet the lady of the house which is a shame because apparently she is responsible for the amazing decor! I mean, words cannot describe the every detail that went into this beautiful establishment. If you're interested in design at all, look no further.
A haven in a busy metropolis, minutes from St. Stephen's Green and great access to public transport it must be said. 
The service was exceptional, from Adam who brought me my much needed coffee on arrival to the morning staff who served us really the best breakfast ever. After getting carried away talking to some lovely Nashvillians over breakfast in the communal breakfast area, I turned back to my cup to find a fresh pot waiting for me. Now that is service. For a busy mom who is taken up all of the time helping everyone else, I felt minded, welcomed and in a happy cocoon for my two night stay. Maybe I need to get out more often, but If I could, I would make that outing to this lovely accommodation in our nation's capital, perhaps the promise of a yearly trip there. Fingers crossed ;) Thankyou kindly!",5,2013,07,30
216,Outstanding.,"I'm not much of a reviewer myself, but I had to make an exception for an exceptional place.
I arrived to Number 31 July 20th and stayed for 7 nights with my girlfriend. We were in the Georgian part of the hotel, overlooking the oasis-like connecting garden.
Having heard of the breakfasts I wasn't disappointed. Staying long enough to sample each dish the full irish was a highlight for me. Try half a bowl of porridge before also if you're very hungry. 
Noel and his staff are wonderful. They can't do enough for you- despite number 31 being a B&B.
I would be back here in a heartbeat.",5,2013,07,30
216,Beats the 5 star hotels handsdown,"A warm welcome, interesting architecture, design. Number 31 has a perfect location for city centre walking and the best breakfast in Dublin. Noel exudes class, authority with a quirky sense of humour as is befitting to a former army officer. Time and again I return to stay in this homely environment where service is above the levels offered at the 5 star hotels. Any establishment offering their guests Haasten beds is clearly thinking of peoples backs and a good sleep. This is the perfect antidote to constant stays in JW Marriotts, Four Seasons, Sheratons or Westin Hotels. I will be back soonest!",5,2013,07,29
216,A bit noisy,"We originally booked here for 4 nights in July 2013 but had to cut it short after 1 night of no sleep.
The rooms themselves here are quite nicely done despite being rather small and up many flights of stairs. The breakfast is a feature here too. The staff we met were also friendly.
We arrived in Ireland to a record period of high temperatures which was unfortunate in regard to staying at Number 31 as there is no air conditioning in the Georgian accommodation, probably because it would only be required once every 10 years or less. The combination of the heat and the street noise meaning we could not have a window open at night was not a good one.
Noel was kind enough to allow us to check out after 1 night without any penalty. He also recommended a couple of places to stay in the Connemarra district (west of Galway). One of which, Dolphin Beach House in Clifden, I have reviewed.
Perhaps in more normal weather conditions in Dublin this would have been a more comfortable place to stay. Having said this I think for what is ostensibly a B&B, it is quite expensive.",3,2013,07,26
216,Warm welcome to Dublin,"I really enjoyed this hotel, sadly only had three nights here but would come back when next in Dublin.
I arrived jet-lagged and tired to a very warm welcome from Linda and I was in time for a lovely cooked breakfast and some friendly conversation with other guests in the conservatory/breakfast room.
We were two friends travelling together, meeting in Dublin after our respective flights. (we live in two different countries)  We had a twin room (number 33 in the Georgian building) which was lovely, high ceilings, comfy beds, very nicely decorated, a dresser to unpack into and enough hanging space in the wardrobe.
The bathroom was very nice and I liked that it was quite separate from the bedroom, you could close the door to the bedroom and there was a small vestibule and bathroom off that.

The breakfast which was included in the price was fantastic, lots of different cooked choices plus a continental selection of fruit, yogurt, cereal etc. Delicious porridge!! It was all delicious in fact, and the servers were all delightful and efficient. After the breakfast here we were set up until dinner.

There were quite a few stairs to climb but this did not bother us, we are not exactly young anymore but we are fit.
We also enjoyed the walk into St.Stephen's Green and the centre of the city, did not find it far at all. Mind you, we are walkers and both enjoyed looking at the lovely old buildings and taking in the neighbourhood.

We were given some local restaurant recommendations by Linda and enjoyed both of them very much, and they were an easy walk from the hotel.
On our last day we had a really interesting chat with Noel. Could have sat there all day chatting but we had more of Ireland to explore!",4,2013,07,20
216,"Not worth the price, stay in a hotel!","Like many others, we looked forward to staying at this highly rated B&B in Dublin.  The room we were given opened directly into the dining room (literally...we could hear the forks and plates each morning as soon as anyone came to eat).  The bathroom had no area to place toiletries at all, including the shower (how about a little shelf or soap dish?!) and the funky-designed shower essentially flooded the bathroom every time because it's only a half-door.  Half of the outlets and lights didn't work, and even after kindly making them aware of the issue, it did not get fixed.  Moreover, we only had one little window with little to no ventilation and not even a fan to keep the room cool.  Other than that, the breakfast was very good (as expected at a top B&B), and the hotel interior design was impressive.  As this was our final stop in Ireland, after staying in amazing B&Bs in Galway and Cork, we knew it would be the most expensive.  However, the B&B experience is truly lost in Dublin (no real connection with the owners here as in other B&Bs) and we would 100% stay in a nice hotel for less than what we paid.  In the end, it's just not worth the price, even for their delicious food...bottom line, stay in a hotel in Dublin, you will save money and have a better experience.",2,2013,07,19
216,Disappointed,"Was excited about this stay based on reviews.  We arrived and having indicated it was our anniversary was hoping for a nice room.  Was led from one building through courtyard to another building along a maze of uneven , dangerous stairways . My husband tripped with his luggage on a deceiving bottom step ,which we felt should have been pointed out by our host who was leading it.  We were led below street level to a dark room with poor lighting.  Room had one window that was below the street. It did not smell moldy or dusky, so decided not to complain and went with it!  But we were unhappy.  The lighting was extremely poor in the room and especially the bathroom. The bathroom was colored  in dark brown, which I couldn't help but feel was disguising some issues.  I took a flashlight and discovered areas of mold in several places on the curved ceiling.  Bed was uncomfortable .  Just felt as if we were in a dark moldy basement.   On the upside.....the breakfast was delicious especially the eggs benedict!
would not recommend for the elderly or impaired as many uneven surfaces and stairs.  Request that you not get a basement room!  The hotel was quirky and interesting in other ways!   Also, the rate was too high compared to our other stays in Ireland .",3,2013,07,14
216,"Beautiful hotel, no lift!","Number 31 would have garnered a 5 rating, but with no lift and very tall ceilings the trek up to the third floor was a little daunting while carrying luggage or coming in from a late night of music.
Otherwise, the house is beautiful! One of the old Georgians, it's location is perfect for exploring Dublin City Centre. 
The house itself is elegantly decorated with lovely antiques as well as contemporary pieces. I felt as though I'd stepped into a story from Joyce's Dubliners!
Our room was lovely, octagonal, with aubergine walls and gilted moldings. The mid-century furniture added just the right quirk. The bed was comfortable and bathroom completely modern.
It was a little noisy, what with the car alarms ringing for hours, but that's to be expected in a city. We had no trouble sleeping.
Breakfast in the modern addition was fabulous. There we were able to visit with our host, who was a delight. 
We had many choices including a buffet of cereals, fruit, and yogurt. My favorite was the cheese omelet. Also, the French press coffee was a great addition.
We would stay at Number 31 again, as long as we are able to climb those stairs! (In fairness, there are rooms on the first floor!)",4,2013,07,12
216,Swanky and surprisingly child friendly!,"We stayed here for our last two nights for a 2 week trip in Summer 2013. We were travelling with our 4 and 6 year old. 

Number 31 was very responsive to emails with questions we had about car rental drop-off, etc. before we arrived. When we arrived we were able to check in early which was great since I was able to stay at the hotel with the two kids while my husband dropped off the rental car in Dublin Center (per their recommendation). They had us come over to the lovely lounge area for tea and hot cocoa. My kids thought getting to have cups and saucers and their own pot was amazing. The kids requested we have tea the next day, too and are still talking about it. 

It is really well located. There is a fantastic playground in St. Stephen's Green which is about 2 (long) blocks away. We were able to walk to Temple Bar, the museums, and Grafton Street without whining. 

It would have been hard to find the place without a GPS. Dublin is really hard to navigate in in a car.... much more so than anywhere else during our trip. The GPS unit was a great help throughout our trip.

The breakfast is great. From the fruit to the fresh-squeezed OJ to the breads to the omelette it was all great. And, again, they made cocoa for the kids to have while we were having tea and coffee with breakfast. Such a cool treat.

They arranged car pick-up early one morning and had early breakfast for us on the day we flew out. It was 35 euros and made getting to the airport easy.",5,2013,07,10
216,My 3rd stay here and still lovin it,"On my 3rd trip to Dublin I had no doubt where I wanted to stay, here at #31.  Rooms and service are always great along with the owner and staff.  Wonderfully located for those walks into shopping and St. Stephen's Green.  There are several restaurants close and one right across the canal at Upper Leeson area, not to mention a pub or two.  Owner has always been helpful with any request and managed a slightly earlier breakfast before we left.  Customer service is always a wonderful thing.  There were a few negatives though that came up.  In order to get Wi-Fi we had to get ""codes"" daily and this was an inconvenience for 4 days.  Other would be lobby does need a bit refurbishing as someone else stated.  Lastly there was a young woman to check us in and there was no way we were asking her to drag 4 heavy bags up stairs to our rooms but it would have been nice to have help with that (and she did offer) after a long trip.",4,2013,07,09
216,Perfect Location to see Dublin,"Number 31 is in the perfect location.  It is in a safe Georgian neighborhood a half mile from St. Stephen's green, Trinity college and Grafton Street.  

We received a very warm welcome and were given breakfast as soon as we arrived, which was very much appreciated after 16 hours on an airplane.  When we finished eating a delicious breakfast, our room was clean and we were able to check-in.  We reserved a family room which easily slept four (2 adults & 2 teenagers).  The room was beautiful with high ceilings, beautiful crown molding, and floor to ceiling windows.  The bathroom was updated and very clean as was the room.  

We really enjoyed our two nights here and would not hesitate to recommend this hotel.

We bought a hop on hop off bus ticket that let us get around the city for the two days we were there.  You can pick up the bus right at St. Stephen's green.",5,2013,07,08
216,Very comfortable B&B in terrific location,"Stayed for two nights in this Georgian Guesthouse.  Rooms were nicely appointed and bed/linens extremely comfortable.  Bathroom was marble (shower only) but the hotel itself was very clean.  Breakfast was delicious with many wonderful food selections.  I held back on giving this B&B 5 stars only because the lobby/reception area is very dated and is need of refurbishing. Otherwise, the hotel's prime location (within 10 minutes walk to the best sights) and warm feeling would make me want to stay here again.",4,2013,07,07
216,What an awesome home of a guesthouse,"The Number 31 Guesthouse turned out to be the very highlight of our tour of Ireland. Splendid location, within walking distance to the historic downtown, gorgeous atmosphere of a Georgian residence combined tastefully with contemporary design, a breakfast leaving no wishes open, a beautiful small flower-garden between the residence and the coachman house where have find a splendid lounge and the upstairs breakfast room with terrace. The very warm welcome made us really feel at home. The only awkward aspect is the most complicated access to wifi of all the places in the world we had stayed on so far - just incredible what data you have to deliver in order to get access.",4,2013,07,02
216,Warm and friendly,"We spent our first night in Dublin in this charming place, about a 5 minute walk from St. Stephen's Green. They gave us an Irish welcome, with coffee and treats, and of course a wonderful story. They were accommodating to our arrival time, and went through a map of Dublin, pointing out the highlights, and great restaurants. Thank you for a lovely stay.",5,2013,07,01
216,"Lovely place, great location","We stayed at 31 both at the beginning of a 3 week trip, and at the end. Loved it...lovely place, nice people, great location and good breakfasts. Nice places for dinner within walking distance...would go back in a heart beat!",5,2013,06,30
216,"Great location, v.comfortable, superb breakfast","Once past the unpromising exterior of the entrance, everything was just marvellous. More a B&B than a hotel, but what a B&B.  Lovely adaptation of a Georgian house.  Luxurious rooms, gorgeous veranda with long communal dining table with the most fabulous breakfast.  You certainly won't need any lunch.",4,2013,06,24
216,Number 31 is #1 in our book!,"This charming inn located about a 5 minute walk from St. Stephen's Green is fabulous!!!  The owners take pride in this property and it shows.  We flew in from the states and sent a note stating that our flight would be early (as in 5am) and would it be possible to check in early.  Low and behold, our room was ready for our weary bodies and the entire staff could not have been more accommodating!  Additionally, a traditional Irish Breakfast is included in the price of the room and was EXCELLENT.  Overall, I would recommend this hotel to anyone wanting a beautiful setting, clean and comfortable room, and a wonderful breakfast.  Thanks to the owners and staff at Number 31.",5,2013,06,23
216,Lovely Irish Hideaway,"When we arrived we were greeted with a lovely cup of tea and cookies. Our room was large,very  beautiful and had excellent beds and bedding. My only complaint about the room was the lack of  light. There was a comfy chair to sit in, but absolutely no light to read by. Very poor light in the bathroom as well. Good location. Nice courtyard and great breakfast.",4,2013,06,19
216,Honestly just fabulous. We'll be back!,"Fond memories, great rooms, friendly service, clean, cute garden, and great breakfast meaning overall great value and satisfaction. A real haven amongst the city! And all with a smile and that personal touch. A wonderful first or last stop in Ireland to gather yourself and explore the CBD. Wonderful.",5,2013,06,08
216,Great Irish Hospitality,"This hotel is tucked away and easy to pass by, but it was a great location for exploring Dublin for the first time.  We were welcomed immediately from our overnight flight with a great breakfast and a place to store our bags.  Maps of the city were provided and places to see and eat were circled.  We were in Ireland with our two grown daughters and our niece and we all had rooms in the Georgian townhouse through the garden.  The rooms were spacious and nicely decorated, and the townhouse had its own door to the side street.  The hospitality was outstanding and the breakfast was incredible. Number 31 takes about 5 minutes to get to st Stephens green which was our key starting point for exploring. Great location and gets you out of the center for a quieter nights sleep.
When I return to Dublin this is where I will stay.",4,2013,06,05
216,Number 31 Best Service,"This hotel is run by the best people! They are extremely accommodating, service minded, great people.  They made our stay so relaxing.  The hotel itself is quite cute...love the place. Comfortable beds, too!! Breakfast is very good selection.
I would definitely stay here again.  Nice neighborhood.",5,2013,06,05
216,"I'd prefer to give it a 3.5, but not an option.","Let me start by saying that this is a lovely hotel with a very charming host and staff.  In addition, they serve a delicious breakfast. And now for what could use improvement... First, in order to get Wi-fi you need a voucher that requires a password and you have to register on a website and it all is a lot more complicated than it should be.  Every other place provides one simple code.  Second, we could not control the heat in our room and we first baked like potatoes then fried like chips until we decided to open the window to a noisy Dublin street that lead to sinus issues the next morning from being exposed to the elements.  We also got little sleep due to the discomfort.  I don't recommend this hotel if you have problems climbing stairs or if you want to be in close proximity to all the action of Dublin.  It is definitely a good mile walk in the coldest of Ireland weather to get to pub central if you stay here.  On the other hand, if you want away from the tourists, there is a nice pub full of locals just a few blocks away.  They will direct you.",4,2013,06,05
216,Breakfast and a beautiful Garden,"Be prepared to work at finding #31, our cab driver drove past it twice. Walking up to a moodily lit door in an alley, think 1920's speak easy isn't for everyone. But once inside it nicely furnished and very peaceful.
We had a room in the Georgian townhouse through the garden. It is beautifully decorated, traditional and trendy all at the same time. Our room was nice but the definition of European, read that as small. It took some discussion and a little geometry to figure out where to put our suitcases. Between the two beds, the armoire, the two wing back chairs, two end tables and a dresser it took some doing to fit, but we made it happen. Also could have used a couple more plugs in the bedroom.
Very nice bathrooms. Roomy with nice finishing touches. I am so glad one of the other reviews mentioned having some difficulty with turning the shower on.  It really did take a bit to make it work, but once it got going the water pressure and temp were good.

Noel and Linda are wonderful hosts. The breakfast is one of my fondest memories of my trip to Ireland. Best breakfast ever. A “ wee” bowl of porridge and a tasty omelette are the perfect fuel for a day of exploring. It was really nice to visit with the other guests over breakfast in the family style dining room.
Noel was very helpful in navigating the city and had some great suggestions on how to organize our time to make sure we covered everything.

Overall pleased with our stay at #31.",4,2013,06,03
216,Nice but not for the price,"This is a lovely place and in a good location however you'd be hard pressed to be poorly located in Dublin given its size....the room was quite small and bathroom tiny. If you are a larger person you will not ifit in the shower cubicle which also only provided hot water once.....in four nights. The breakfast and ladies on service are gorgeous equally. The guy who 'checked me in' was decidedly disinterested in providing info and, given I'd been travelling for over a day, (from sydney) a bit of enthusiasm would've helped! In all - nice with a high price.",3,2013,05,31
216,A great base for exploring Dublin,"We were very happy with our choice of Number 31.  We were made to feel most welcome throughout our stay.   Breakfast was included, with a good variety of delicious meals on offer.  The hotel is close to St. Stephen's Green, a beautiful park, and is a reasonable walk to major attractions such as Trinity College and the museums.  Also, the hotel has a pleasant lounge with fireplace, suitable for relaxing after a busy day exploring the city, and serves complementary tea/coffee there, refreshment much appreciated by weary travelers.",5,2013,05,30
216,We loved it,Great hotel.  Nice family sized room.  Very comfortable room and beds.  Excellent breakfasts.  Very attentive staff.  This was a real find.  Close enough to central Dublin.  Very close to St. Stephen's Green.  ,5,2013,05,29
216,My idea of a perfect hotel,"From the minute I walked through the garden I knew this was my kind of hotel. Small, personal, quirky and with friendly, attentive staff. Very relaxed (lovely sunken sofas), spotless modern, well-equipped rooms and a wide choice of freshly-cooked locally sourced breakfasts - best porridge ever. Will definitely be back. ",5,2013,05,25
216,Most convenient,"The modern decor may not appeal to everyone, but my friends and I loved Number 31. I cannot imagine being in a more convenient, quiet accommodation that is so close to everything yet not in the ""touristy"" part of town. And breakfast rates a ""wow!"" as it is served family style in a simple space just outside the kitchen (there are also tables literally outside). Excellent choices of fruit and granola would be enough, that is, before your cooked breakfast order arrives and adds to the pleasure. Noel and Linda are friendly, helpful proprietors. Be sure to ask directions to the canal and walk along the path all the way to the river Liffey. 
There were a few technical issues that were just a little unduly challenging for this place. Getting on the wifi was difficult to figure out on our own. Moreover, getting kicked off and having to log on again every time our phones went to sleep was annoying but was not unique to Number 31. Lighting in room 15 (below street level) was low and without options for improvement. It was also not obvious how to turn on and regulate the shower. These were small distractions, but some orientation--there was essentially none--would surely have helped. I would definitely stay at Number 31 again, however.",4,2013,05,20
216,Why do they call this a hotel?,"This is a good sized B&B within a short 10 - 15 min walk to city centre. No licensed bar, room service or restaurant in sight. On first impressions we weren't sure if we had come to the right place, located in a lane way & no signage. This can add curiosity for some and confusion for others. There was only 1 staff person here when a number of us checked in short succession. Be patient and just keep ringing the bell. Eventually someone will open the door! The interior has a vogue magazine element about it, although areas are showing some real wear & tear. Some guests made comment about the stairs as there was no lift. We were fortunate to be on the 1st floor in the Georgian building which has a separate entrance onto Fitzwilliam.
There is a lovely small courtyard garden separating the property buildings, which gives access to the common area and breakfast room upstairs.
Our room was clean and quite spacious. Bathroom had a large rain shower which was different.
Breakfast had a very good variety to suit most tastes with a good selection of cooked meals. 
There are plenty of restaurants within minutes for dinner. 
LITTLE THINGS TO KNOW

Order your tea/coffee in the common area - no room facilities 

Bath towels are tiny

Parking is off site and you must grab a button to get to or move. It's tedious

Room lighting very poor for reading or hair & makeup. 

On showering, no matter how hard you tried, the floor would be drenched. More a safety thing really

Finally, our attempts at free Wifi ended in buying a £20 sim. No big deal

I can see the appeal to this style of lodging..... No large groups or children (usually) and still a fairly intimate ambience. 

Thank you for a memorable stay",4,2013,05,18
216,A real treat,"We stayed here in April for my husbands birthday. The hotel is just amazing with large spacious rooms, comfy beds and lovely bathrooms.  Staff are really friendly and the breakfast lives up to the rave reviews on trip advisor. We cant wait for another excuse to return.",5,2013,05,17
216,"Loveliest retreat, a special place","Thank you Noel and Linda for a wonderful stay last night and for putting us in the most gorgeous room. Donna and I had a blast in Dublin but really appreciated our lovely retreat to come 'home' to. Your houses are perfect, and we loved the mix of old and new. Your staff is friendly which relaxes your guests and makes everyone else friendly too! It is like one big party staying with you guys. I will be back.  And for other readers - don't hesitate. Just book it and you can get on with your life and end your Dublin hotel research right now!",5,2013,05,17
216,Once again,We returned to Ireland this year and can report that #31 was as good as ever.  A wonderful location close to the center yet quiet and walking distance to most attractions.  Great hospitality and wonderful breakfast.  Noel and Linda couldn't have been nicer.  See you again.,5,2013,05,17
216,Great Service,"We stayed two nights in May. We were in Room 19 which was on the first floor of a Georgian house with super high ceilings, comfy bed, and a wonderful bay window that looked out on a fabulous small city garden. The room was pleasantly quirky. Juxtaposed to the traditional Georgian setting with gold leaf moldings was a modern chandeliar and lighting! The garden connects the hotel rooms to the dining room, reception and sitting area. The staff was amazing. Our flight was delayed and we arrived after breakfast was completed but Linda immediately insisted that she could whip us up a full Irish breakfast which she immediately did.Every need was attended to and every question answered. Internet service is free for the first 24 hours. I don't know if you get a new free password after that. The hotel is conveniently located in town but there is a short 10 to 15 minute walk to get to the sites such as Trinity College, Grafton Street, etc. Only criticism is that the towels were a bit rough and threadbare and the reception area looked tired  could use freshening up. ",5,2013,05,16
216,My new favorite place to stay in Dublin,"Dublin is one of my favorite cities. My husband had not been to Dublin before and I wanted him to have a good introduction. We hit the jackpot with Number 31 and Noel and his great staff. From the moment we entered through the gate we felt at home. We were in the carriage house, which is an architectural gem -- having tea while sitting in the black leather cushioned conversation pit with a fire in the fireplace was lovely. Our room was spacious, comfortable, and contemporary. The beautiful bathroom was amply supplied with towels and upscale toiletries. Breakfast (included in the rate) in the conservatory was a wonderful way to start the day with choices including a full Irish breakfast, porridge, salmon and eggs, or a selection from the cold bar. Noel is a charming host and we felt like we were staying with favorite family members instead of temporary guests as a B&B. The restaurant recommendations from the staff were excellent (did we really see actor Stephen Rea at The Farm? I think so). Number 31 is within walking distance of the museums, Trinity College, Grafton Street, and St. Stephen's Green. It was hard to leave Number 31 to continue our journey, but this is the place we will stay wen we return. Thank you again, to Noel and staff for a fabulous stay.",5,2013,05,05
216,Noel and his team make Number 31 the gem that it is.,"We stayed at Number 31 for our first wedding anniversary for two nights.

When we arrived we pulled down a random little street and thought we were lost! Surely this wasn't where the hotel that our friends raved about was. 

After buzzing the buzzer and we walked in, all was revealed. We were welcomed whole heartily and like one of the family immediately by Noel. Linda was swift to introduce herself and offer superb coffee and biscuits. Noel then gave us some welcome 'what not to miss' advice. 

We were escorted through the beautifully quaint garden and into the main hotel. The period features and decor were magnificent with super comfy bed!

As with most other reviews, breakfast time was the highlight. Amazing selection, plenty of it and the taste was excellent. Noel and the staff were attentive and jovial without being too overbearing. All diners seemed relaxed and enjoyed the 'craic' which was always delivered with a smile.

We are really looking forward to our next visit.

Thank you

Ian & Claire",5,2013,05,04
216,Felt at home,"Just left Dublin and Number 31.  Stayed in room 22 which was spacious, clean and comfortable.  Even the bathroom was fine. The breakfast was incredible and, since it is included in the rate, it made the hotel a good value (I did not have to eat again until dinner).  Best of all was the helpfulness and warmth of the management and staff -- made us feel we were at the best combination of a large B and B and a small luxury hotel.  Thank you, Noel",5,2013,05,03
216,Pure enjoyment,"31 Market is gorgeous.  From the moment my sister and I walked in, Noel and his staff made us feel right at home.  We were able to enjoy breakfast even before we checked in and upon checkout, he even invited us to come back for breakfasts even if we were not staying there.  Bathrooms are spacious, bed was so comfortable we didn't want to get up in the morning.  I will definitely come back and stay here.  Location is a 5 minute walk from airport Aircoach and about 10 minutes to Grafton Street through St Stephens Green park.  Anoslutely Gorgeous!!!!!",5,2013,04,29
216,Excellent,"We stayed 3 nights here at Number 31 in late April, we were welcomed warmly and treated to a complimentary breakfast on our arrival which was most welcome. Our room was elegant and lovely to come back to each day after sightseeing. We had everything we needed and it was hard to believe that we were in the centre of Dublin as the house was so quiet. Breakfasts were a highlight. Thanks to Noel and Linda and the team for taking care of us so well, they made our stay in Dublin one to remember.",5,2013,04,27
216,Perfection,"Second time staying at number 31 and it is a gem. You would never think you are near to the heart of Dublin. When you arrive you are helped with you're bags if needed and you're car is looked after - effortless. Noel and all the staff are just so professional and warm in their welcome. The rooms are just beautiful, a must for anyone who loves architecture. Spotless bathrooms, plenty towels. There is no tea and coffee in the room but not a problem as available anytime.The sunken lounge and garden are fab for a coffee. Bottled water in the rooms. The breakfast is one of the best I've had , so much choice and so fresh. Whether on you're own or as a couple or group, great base as you walk outside Dublin is there. Looking forward to my next stay there.
When we stayed after a long day in the city we showered and were heading out to eat, asked for fresh towels for the morning and when we arrived home, plenty of fresh towels and water refills. As stated before service is excellent. Take a bow Number 31",5,2013,04,24
216,Great Boutique Hotel,"We stayed 2 nights at Number 31 in early April. We arrived very early, 7am and the host on call at that time was great about helping us in and brought us tea and coffee. When the kitchen was ready, he called us up for their amazing breakfast. The lobby is a mix of old and new and maybe not as glamorous as the pictures, but it was unique and homey. The before mentioned breakfast is the best we had in our 10 day trip all through Ireland. Super fresh berries, eggs, and superior tea among many more fresh options.                                                                  We had a nice spacious room on the second floor, and the manager, Noel helped us with our 3 big suitcases, but I have to say that if you do not have help with your bags, it would be quite difficult to drag them down some stairs, across the cute courtyard, up some more stairs and into the great Georgian house where the rooms are. Our room was big and artfully decorated with a view of the courtyard. The bathrooms are all re-done so they are very nice and I did hear water running in the other rooms, but it was not constant. The one and only grumble I have is that there was a yellow vintage 70's looking chair that was a little stained and filled with down feathers. I laid a couple of cashmere sweaters on it and they came up covered in tiny feathers- very hard to remove. It was just a small annoyance compared to all the other great things about this place, especially the hosts who are extremely kind and courteous, who called the rental car service to secure a car for us. They even showed us the wild duck that was nesting with her new ducklings in the shrubs by the atrium! Don't hesitate to visit Number 31.",5,2013,04,17
216,Great place to stay in Dublin,"Great central location, within walking distance of all the main sites and with some good places to eat and drink close by. Wonderful hosts, who were attentive, extremely helpful and friendly without overdoing it. Utterly delicious breakfasts beautifully presented. We stayed in the main Georgian house in a nice big room on the ground floor with a good bathroom. The only (minor) grumbles I have are that the plumbing is quite noisy and the towels could have been bigger! Otherwise it was a terrific place to stay and I would recommend it to anyone. It was like having your own town house in Dublin but without the hassle.",4,2013,04,10
216,Exceptional boutique hotel. The best!,"I had the pleasure of staying at Number 31 during my stay in Dublin in late February 2013.
The owners and staff are very polite, professional, most accommodating and helpful with recommendations of places to visit and restaurants.
This hotel is  elegantly appointed in a Georgian mansion linked by a lovely garden to a more architecturally modern building.  It is spotlessly clean. My room was elegant, beautifully decorated and spacious.
The breakfast options are healthy, generous and the food is organic.  The fruit and fruit salads are always fresh and organic, as well. Special dietary requirements are accommodated.
We have travelled extensively around the world.  This exquisite hotel is beyond five stars!",5,2013,04,08
216,Excellent boutique hotel,"I loved my stay at Number 31 recently.  This place felt like home, not a hotel.  It really is a very-large house.  And the hospitality is unlike anything else.  I was greeted warmly with breakfast upon my arrival and every morning of my visit!  Breakfast was incredible, full Irish breakfast and other options, plus homemade cranberry bread!!
I would highly recommend this un-known little place over any other!!",5,2013,03,26
216,Perfect stay in Dublin,"We chose this hotel in part thanks to the many good reviews in here and after watching the picture, I had a crush on this hotel. We visited Dublin for the Saint Patrick's week-end 2013.

Ups:
- Small hotel : this is a small hotel (almost B&B), owned by a lovely man who is always kind and helpful. He welcomed us with coffee & tea, a smile and gave us useful tips and things to do in Dublin. The hotel is made of two buildings linked by a lovely garden (unfortunately, the weather did not let us enjoy it enough). The interior is decorated with style, modern and classic at the same time. Even the owner's dog is lovely and cheerful.
- Room : our room was located on the 4th floor, as it is a narrow building the is no elevator, which is not a problem for us, but mention it while you book if you mind the stairs (there are quite a lot). The room was cosy and lovely. The bathroom spacious. There were as well two sofas and a tiny television. The bed was very comfortable.
- Breakfast: the breakfast was absolutely incredible. There was a choice between 6-7 hot dishes, plus a cold buffet. Once again, the lovely staff and owner made the experience even better. Plus, the breakfast room was absolutely lovely, mainly the veranda part. I fell in love with the cake. Luckly, the receipe is on their website :-D
- Check out: as our flight was leaving early morning, we did the check out the day before during breakfast. The owner was once again lovely and even called us a taxi for the next morning.
- Location : from the hotel you have a 5-10 minutes walk to St Stephens Green and Grafton Street, which is not far and quite enjoyable. On the way, you see some pubs and you can stop for a stout if you're too tired ;-) (any excuse goes)

Downs:
- Amenties : we usually travel to big hotels, with every amneties in and outside the room. In fact, inside the room the is no safe, tea/coffee maker, ropes, etc. The amenties in the room are basic. For us it was not a problem as the hotel overall made the stay more than enjoyable, but this might be a problem for some clients. Plus, except for breakfast, there is no possibilites of eating in the hotel.
- Cold : obviously March Dublin is cold. The isolation of the window was not perfect, letting some outside air in. Having travelled to the UK many time, the type of construction is quite similar, so I knew what to expect. Once again, this is not a problem for us and a good excuse to stay in the compfy bed.
- Plug problem: the only real negative thing I have to say about this hotel is the fact the bathroom was lacking of a plug for the hairdryer, which was kind of annoying. 
- Towels : a bit tiny.

Overall, an amazing experience. Number 31 will be without any doubts my choice for next time in Dublin! It made me enjoy smaller hotels and I will consider this kind of hotels for my next trips.",5,2013,03,26
216,Perfect if you want something different,"I stayed here in January as I wanted to try somewhere different in Dublin and it was a very pleasant experience.Upon arrival I was welcomed warmly by reception and offered tea or coffee before I retired to my room. I passed through the sunken living room to the garden which was absolutely gorgeous, but as it was January I didn't stay in it too long! My room was a single on the fourth floor but far from being cramped it was a perfect size. I didn't get to enjoy the breakfast as I opted for a lie-in after a night out but it did smell absolutely gorgeous, I guess I'll have to return to try it out! As for location, it was ideal - during the day I walked into the city center and it took about 10-15 minutes at most but there are bus stops nearby to avail of.
The only slight issue was that I was awoken in the night by ""noises"" next door - but to be fair I didn't bring it up with the staff the following day so I'll just leave the blame on my anonymous amorous neighbours! Still it won't stop me from returning, I thought it was a real gem with fantastic staff, beautifully decorated and great location.",4,2013,03,25
216,A gem. Heaven for designers and/or people who love breakfast!,"Number 31 is little known amongst native Dubliners, because it's invisible from the street and isn't open to the passing public. That slightly furtive nature of the place made our recent trip all the more delightful. The aesthetic of the place is its outstanding feature. An endlessly pleasing marriage of grand Georgian and lived-in modernism, it's little wonder that most of the other guests looked like distinguished architects from around the globe.
The rooms are small enough, but perfect and full of interestingness. The sunken lounge is a unique and homely place to while away an hour or so. The breakfast space is convivial, and the breakfast is as good as they say. The staff are few and far between, but smart and properly, humanly charming. 
I can't recommend No.31 highly enough. 

Just a short note on location: it's not all that near Stephen's Green; it's down the canal end of Leeson Street, just behind Coopers Restaurant. ",5,2013,03,23
216,Simply perfect...,"I can only say wonderful things about my stay at Number 31 - from the cup of tea and delicious cranberry cake upon arrival to the unrivalled breakfast the next morning, the whole experience was magical. Beautiful rooms, charming host, friendly and helpful staff... a glorious retreat to refuel and feel pampered! I will definitely be coming again!",5,2013,03,20
216,Gorgeous,"I spent my first night on this trip to Ireland at Number 31, and found it to be as everyone else has described - beautiful rooms, gracious hosts, and an outstanding breakfast.  Breakfast is served in a room with a couple of communal tables, which I really liked, since it gave me the opportunity to chat with some other really interesting people who were staying there.  I particularly liked the location - in a quiet location but near to St Stephens Green, Iveagh Gardens, and Camden St. 

One thing I didn't realize on booking this hotel is that there are actually two buildings; one the modern, original building, and one a Georgian townhouse facing Fitzwilliam St, which shares a garden with the modern building.  I was placed in the townhouse, but didn't mind at all - the room I was given was absolutely palatial, with a remarkably beautiful paper light fixture; and the lobby of the townhouse is quite elegant.

Number 31 is a bit above my usual budget, but I'm glad I chose it for my first night in the country - a lovely, restful place in a very good and convenient neighborhood.",5,2013,03,17
216,Nice Place,"I'll start off by saying that I typically stay in full service hotels that include a bar and lounge area, coffee maker in room, restaurant, etc... so this post may not apply to everyone.  My wife read several reviews on Number 31 and wanted to stay there instead of the Renaissance.  The rooms were nice, but you could hear noise from pretty much every direction (hallway, outside, and above us).  The breakfast was great, but past that you were pretty much on your own.  My wife called to ask for ice twice and someone said they would check but could never find any.  If you wanted a snack or a drink you either had to call or cab or take a pretty good walk.  

So overall the place was fine and rooms were very pretty (and the breakfast really was good).  However, for the price, next time I would do something with more amenities.",3,2013,03,17
216,Food to die for & owners that care,Staying at the Number 31 was the perfect way to start a vacation in Ireland: charming and gracious. The atmosphere was welcoming and location very good. The breakfast was honestly the best meal of our entire trip--and if it were a restaurant I would have come here even if I was staying elsewhere. Some people just know how to run a hotel the right way.,5,2013,03,14
216,First choice for Dublin,"The rooms at 31 are beautiful and the breakfasts were absolutely the best we had on our entire trip.  You also can't beat it's location - it's a very easy walk to everything you'd want to see while still being nestled in a quiet neighborhood.  One thing to note - we stayed on the 4th floor and there was no elevator, which meant a lot of stairs.  If that's an issue for you, I'd recommend asking for something closer to ground floor.  Overall outstanding, though.  Recommended.",5,2013,03,01
216,As advertised,"A flying visit to Dublin offered the opportunity to stay at this boutique guest house where we received a warm welcome. The room was warm, comfortable and reasonably spacious and great care has clearly gone into the decor and fittings throughout. The location  is convenient, walkable of most areas you would be likely to visit on a short trip and importantly close to an Aircoach stop making easy access to and from the airport.
They boast about their award winning breakfasts ..... and every word is true!",5,2013,02,20
216,It's like you're staying with friends in Dublin,"We arrived at the little back door late at night and were very well looked after from the start with someone parking our car for us - just what we needed arriving late and tired in a strange city.  We were shown to our room in the Georgian house which was well appointed with a nice bathroom.  We were on the top floor and the rooms lower down looked a lot grander. Quite a lot of stairs but someone carried our bag for us which was welcome.  I would have liked tea making facilities in the room, though it is available in the lounge if you want it.  Breakfast in the conservatory was very nice indeed.  Host, Nowell, was charming as were all the staff.  When we left, the car was parked right outside the door.  All in all you couldn't fault it - I did think it was a little pricey but that seems to be Dublin.",5,2013,02,19
216,My favourite south Dublin venue,"Cocktails, Food, Staff, Atmosphere, Decor. Everything about this place screams 5 star! I go nearly every thursday after work. Friends, Family, spouses, partners, anyone and everyone will love this place!",5,2013,02,17
216,lovely warm place very well situated,"this is a lovely place with very friendly and discreet staff who give their best. our room was very comfortable & clean, the hotel is very well located. the breakfast, yes, was great. a very enjoyable stay, and a yes if you are visiting dublin",5,2013,02,12
216,Couldn't be Happier,We had a delightful stay at Number 31. Our room was comfortable with very nice beds and a super shower. The location was great and the breakfast outstanding. What was especially nice was the staff. They were helpful and gracious. Every request and need taken care of. The location made us feel like locals with plenty of public transportation and easy access to everything we wanted to see. The peace and quiet of this boutique hotel was ideal for us.,5,2013,02,09
216,A Gorgeous place to stay in Dublin,"The Number 31 is a nice and elegant place to stay in Dublin. I could say that the comfortable room and the garden were what most impressed in that place. They are magnificient.

But it is not just it. The team of Number 31 are helpful and friendly. They helped me all times I needed. 

And I beg you... you must try the wonderful breakfast. The best I ever had.",5,2013,02,06
216,Wonderful Stay in Dublin,"Number 31 was a fantastic hotel!  Wonderful hosts, delicious breakfast, and a very comfortable and cozy boutique hotel.  Very close to all the sights in Dublin.  Really enjoyed my stay and would definitely come back again!",5,2013,02,03
216,Beautiful and Comfortable,"Exactly what we were looking for.  Smallish hotel with graceful decor, pretty outdoor space, comfortable beds, and modern bathrooms.  Excellent breakfast.  Friendly and helpful staff.  Quiet.  I suppose our room was smallish by American standards, but it wasn't a problem for us.

It was a bit difficult to find at first- entrance was off the main street- but not a problem after that.",5,2013,01,18
216,Stylishly casual with a bohemian chic!,"Number 31 is a Georgian boutique hotel that exudes as much character and charm as the host Noel. His warm avuncular welcome was the perfect start to our weekend stay in Dublin. Without so much as an invitation, Noel will tell you where the best places are to eat, drink, shop, etc.

We stayed in room 21. A large king-size room which is in the annex building which fronts on to Fitzwilliam St. The whole place has a beautiful calmness about it - accentuated by the candles that are dotted around the place. Serenity.

Noel and his team provide a delicious breakfast from cereals to full Irish.  I went for the scrambled eggs and salmon. Breakfast is communal.  That is there are two long tables seating eight in the main dining area and one in the conservatory. I like this. However, it can be sterile as not everyone is awake and chatty first thing in the morning and others are just quiet. The only suggestion I would cast in Noel's direction would be to have some Celtic music on in the background, very quietly.

All in all, a wonderful place to stay!",5,2013,01,16
216,Ten out of ten for service!,"Arrived early and greeted with valet parking a hot drink,homemade cake and a warm welcome. Rooms are nicely decorated, warm and rain shower was great. Free parking is a real bonus in dublin so should be accounted for in total price. Breakfast was first class with everything from eggs benedict, and kippers to fresh fruit and good old full Irish. Theres an open fire always on the go and the offer of a hot drink. The staff are friendly and the owner makes you feel right at home. Would definitely go back here.",5,2013,01,12
216,Georgian splendour,"Amazing rooms with beautiful decor, comfortable beds and nice ambient lighting. 

Breakfast is amazing and all of the staff are super friendly and very helpful.

My second stay here and will probably use it again on return trips.",5,2013,01,10
216,"Come for the breakfast, stay for the hospitality","My wife and I had the great fortune to stay at Number 31 during two separate visits to Dublin last week. Number 31 is in an excellent location, within walking distance to St Stephen’s Green, Trinity College, and Grafton Street shopping. The B&B is architecturally interesting, blending old Irish/Georgian, with modern furnishings.  The rooms were large and comfortable, with excellent beds and linens, and modern bathrooms. But the most outstanding feature of this B&B is the unbelievable friendliness and caring of the hosts, and the employees.  The proprietor Noel, welcomed us with a hospitality which we have rarely experienced in our many travels.  Although the Irish are amongst the most friendly people we have come across in our worldwide travels,  he treated us truly like family.  We were in Dublin to visit our daughter, who was studying at Trinity College for the semester. Even though she was not a guest at Number 31, he treated her as if she was not only a guest, but part of his family, asking her to come to breakfast with us each day. The breakfasts are outstanding, with many choices of full Irish breakfast, various permutations of eggs and omelets, frittatas, Irish oatmeal with honey, home baked breads, cereals, all of which were delicious. The food seems to be prepared by a true chef, not just a B&B owner with an interest in cooking. The breakfasts were the best we had in Ireland.  Stay at Number 31 for the lovely furnishings, great location, incredible breakfasts- but most of all, stay for the warm welcoming hospitality of Noel, his wife, and their staff.",5,2012,11,18
216,fantastic,"lovely night spent here last night
great breakfast and attention to detail is beyond compare
thank you very much
in the depths of a recession the cream rises to the top
no more hotels for me in dublin 
i think ive found my home away from home
paddy from sligo.",5,2012,11,11
216,Look no further!,"If you are looking for something a little special and authentically Irish, this is THE place to come and stay.  Warm friendly staff, a beautiful unique property and breakfasts to die for.
A little tricky to find, but don't let that deter you.  This little jewel is worth seeking out.
I will be back!",5,2012,11,11
216,Hard to find but definitely worth the search,"The owner, Noel, is a treasure. Not only is he extraordinarily pleasant and humorous, he is also witty, polite, helpful and knowledgable.  He and his staff provided great eating recommendations, touring ideas and directions.
Breakfast was delicious and varied options.
My greatest frustration was finding the place.  Leeson close is a little alley; hard to find. And to the best of my knowledge, is not marked as a B&B.  the door just bears the number on it and is surrounded by ivy.  Once buzzed past the door, one enters a courtyard. Then, a glass window marked with the name of some architectural firm but no bnb name.  Ok enough about that. Rooms are large, clean and a bit spartan.  Detail is good but goes along with general funky nature of place.  31 is only a five minute walk from Sussex bar ( pretty good food and reasonable) and Canal bar.  Canal bar is great, busy, buzzy and worth the commotion. Canal is more french influence with sussex still trying to find its niche.  Location pretty good; a 5-10 minute walk from st. Stephen's and 30-45 from guiness.",4,2012,11,09
216,Simply brilliant.,"Second time staying at Number 31, and we went out of our way just to stay there this past weekend. Excellent location, and the hospitality is just amazing. No complaints whatsoever. Very relaxed & homely atmosphere, and probably one of the few places left whereby you can truly feel at home whilst travelling. Nothing bad to say about the place. Another very pleasant stay, and we'll be back next time we're in Dublin.",5,2012,11,06
216,Lovely place!,"Grood location, good room, great welcome, fantastic breakfast!
The only bad point is that the price was too high as it had no hotel facilities as such.
I would certainly go back again if the price was a bit lower.",4,2012,10,31
216,Overall good experience,"The welcome was indeed both warm and competent, the breakfast excellent, and the beds good. Tea and coffee available at any time on request. Elegant decoration.

A few small quibbles. Bathroom very dark, room quite dark. Room had single glazing on to street, but noise not a problem at night. No bath, just a shower, though other rooms may differ. Towels rather small. Hard to find somewhere to plug in the hair dryer. More of a guesthouse than a hotel and as such not cheap. Would I recommend it? Yes.",4,2012,10,29
216,Hidden gem in the centre of Dublin,"I was booked in here as we have a college in Dublin. Initially we were dropped off by a taxi in front of a non descript wooden door. We owned it up and went in, met by edwardo who offered us a drink. The place is fantastic, it's basically a massive house split by a fantastic sunken garden. We walked across and my room was the biggest and comfy bed ever. In the morning everyone was very friendly and the breakfast was the best I have had. I always judge these things on would I stay here with the family, a definite yes from me. ",5,2012,10,28
216,All around fantastic place!,"Every aspect of my stay at Number 31 far exceeded my expectations.  The premises were in an excellent location of Dublin, amid and walking distance to the central city, but off a street that is quiet enough to sleep well at night.  My room was large, cozy, and, upon first walking in, I presumed there was some mistake - it was elegant!  The rest of the hotel is also open and furnished well, creating a welcoming environment to all visitors, art, garden, floral, and candle decor adding a nice touch; and the breakfast areas (one indoor, one outdoor) are very quaint, offering a scenic atmosphere while eating some of the best breakfasts in Dublin.  The hotel staff are very friendly and approachable, beginning with a warm welcome and excellent recommendations of nearby must-see spots and doing anything to enhance your comfort, and my stay ended with their serving my breakfast early in order to ensure that I could catch my flight with a full stomach.
Number 31, its rooms, and its amenities were obviously carefully and beautifully designed with a customer-centered view in order to create a pleasant stay, directed by an able staff who demonstrate a positive and casual nature that helps one feel right at home.",5,2012,10,22
216,"Great hospitality, poor room","Stayed 2 nights at Number 31. The welcome and hospitality were outstanding and the lounge as well as the conservatory for a wonderful breakfast were first class.  However, our stay was impacted negatively by our room.  Though clean, cosy and comfortable it was almost too small to get past the bed, and only enough space to open one bag at a time. There was a hole in the wall (lack of basic maintenance?) but the worst feature being located in the ground floor immediately beneath the kitchen. From 6am there was constant foot traffic noise from above, not conducive for sleep and certainly detracted from the expected experience at €190 per night.",3,2012,10,15
216,like staying with friends in their gorgeous home,"This Georgean townhouse with refurbished coach house and garden in between is all that you've read about on Tripadvisor. Warm welcome (Noel - stop carrying two 40 pound suitcases up two flights for us, you're not twenty anymore and we can help!), a map Noel will mark up with must-see and must-eat locations, and friendly attentiveness throughout the stay. The restaurant recommendations were spot-on.

We stayed here twice during our Ireland stay - 5 nights and then a final night before we flew home - and both times in the townhouse, not the carriage house. Both times we faced into the garden so it was pretty quiet considering how close you are to Lower Leeson Street.

Great location, just out of all the busyness but just minutes to walk there and just off the canal, perfect for a quiet soothing walk when you need it. Also just south of the canal is a lovely residential area with great restaurants not packed with tourists - particularly Farm, Sussex and O'Connell's.

Between Noel, Linda, the charming woman who cooks breakfast, the friendly housekeeping crew and everyone else, you will feel you are staying with friends. Could not have been better. If this fits into your budget, stay here, you will have no regrets.",5,2012,10,02
216,Wonderful stay,"We had a lovely 2 night stay at Number 31.  The hosts and staff were very helpful and went the extra mile to make our stay successful.  The rooms were very comfortable, roomy and, best of all, quiet!  Nice location - we walked everywhere we needed to go.  The breakfast was the best we had during our 9 day Ireland tour and you can even find the recipe for the cranberry loaf on their website!",5,2012,09,25
216,"Wonderful, once again!","Nine months after my first visit, i was lucky enough to find availability on relatively short notice for the last two nights of my trip to Ireland. When I made my inquiry about a room, Noel remembered me, and made me feel like an old friend. All of the other members of the staff there made me feel equally as welcome. Breakfast was again, the best I had in the country, love the big airy room where I met couples from around the world, and shared stories over a meal, and wonderful coffee. If you have the opportunity to stay here, don't bother considering anything else.",5,2012,09,22
216,Fantastic,"Feels like home after three weeks on the road. Gorgeous- friendly staff, beautiful rooms and yummy breakfast. It's a must stay if u are in Dublin. The location is great very close to graft on street and all surrounding sites.",5,2012,09,17
216,Wonderful introduction to Dublin,"My husband and I stayed here for the first two nights of our honeymoon in Ireland. The Aircoach proved to be the least expensive way to get from the airport to B&B with only a short walk. Number 31 is conveniently located just outside the city centre, with only a 10 minute walk or so into the core. We enjoyed our walk through St. Stephen's green on the way. We stayed in the main house with a room that had a small patio out back (unfortunately it was a little too chilly to use). The room was very comfortable with a modern bathroom. My only two small complaints were that we could hear our neighbours noise a little too well, and the room had a bit of a musty/damp smell. I'm guessing it's due to the steam of the shower being held in the room in the carpet and wood ceiling. The breakfasts were absolutely amazing and the host incredibly accommodating and friendly. We would definitely recommend this place and stay again.",5,2012,09,09
216,Only Place I will Ever Stay in Dublin,"OK, we heard they have a great breakfast, but I thought ""how good can it be?""  I've had good breakfasts here and there.  This, however, it an unbelievable breakfast.  Great modern rooms in a private setting with outstanding service.  I think the owners would have laid down in a puddle to prevent our shoes from getting wet.  They hussle, and they are organized, and it was just an fantastic hotel experience.",5,2012,09,08
216,At home,"If you want to have the feeling to be at home in Dublin, don't hesitate and book the number 31. The team is just fantastic and rooms are so beautiful.
The location is great.
Don't hesitate to test the full Irish Breakfast, it is simply delicious.
It was a real pleasure for me to stay in this hotel.",5,2012,09,06
216,Superior B and B,"A little tricky to find by car but well worth it! Noel was a very welcoming host and the decor is splendid inside making the most of the the Georgian heritage. Breakfast was superb with great variety offered. The location within walking distance of Trinity College, St Stephens Green and the Liffey made this a great place to finish our weeks trip to Ireland. ",5,2012,08,29
216,Fabulous hospitality,"This is a lovely boutique hotel.  It is pricey BUT Dublin in general is very expensive for hotels.The location is perfect, just 5 minutes walk to St Stephen's Green. The house is beautful; a typical Georgian townhouse, beautifully renovated. Breakfast is fabulous and Noel and his ""eam"" couldn't be more helpful and hospitable. We will most definitely be back.",5,2012,08,24
216,Hotel with B&B feel to it,"A bit difficult to find and not ideally located, but other than that we had a great stay. Not the regular style hotel, but the nice feel of a family owned bed&breakfast, but the facilities of a hotel. 

Breakfast is amazing, choice for everyone, every morning we didn't know what to choose and wished our bellies were bigger.

Rooms and interior are decorated tasteful, not too fancy hip, but nice. Staff makes effort to give you a good check in and direct you in the places you want to go. Don't be in a hurry, you will be give tea and biscuits.",4,2012,08,24
216,"Chic, arty hotel","We loved this hotel.  Yes, it is quite expensive, but less than most of the other hotels we found in Dublin.  It is somewhat hidden away down a side street (no signs announcing it is a hotel on the building!) but once you step inside the gate, you are instantly aware of the fabulous architecture and design details.  We initially had a room in the coach house but changed to one in the Georgian building as it had a little more character.  Lots of candles everywhere, a calm little courtyard / garden and a delightful roaring fire in the main 'lounge'.  Breakfast was delicious.  Go!",5,2012,08,22
216,Nice place to stay in Dublin but all in all a bit pricey,"We stayed at Number 31 for 2 nights in August 2012 and in general were happy with our stay. 
The house has a lovely Georgian style. It is not too far from the city centre. Our family room was spacious and comfy. Breakfast is really great, the owner very welcoming and helpful with recommendations of places to see, restaurants, etc.
Our only restriction is the noise: our room (no 21) was on the first floor, on a large and busy street and had no double glazing, so we could hear everything from the early morning until late at night (cars, pedestrians, sirens). So if you are noise sensitive, when booking insist on having a room which is either not on the street or on the upper floors !",4,2012,08,21
216,Best Hospitality,"I don't think I've ever come across the superb level of hospitality that Number 31 offers every guest.  I arrived a little harried after a long journey, and the owner (Noel) immediately ushered myself and two other travellers in.  After making us tea, we each got a personallized map of Dublin, along with fantastic recommendations for meals.  

The room was very comfortable, and an upgrade from the booking I had orginally made.   Mid-century furnishings are a lovely and stylish contrast to the Georgian architecture.  The property is walkable from central Dublin, and offers easy access to many attractions.  Breakfasts each morning were more than I could eat - full buffet plus a hot breakfast.

Noel and his staff also arranged a day trip to Northern Ireland (Belfast), with a reliable guide and all of the train instructions to get to Belfast and back.",5,2012,08,20
216,A hidden charmer in Dublin,"Discrete and stylish, and clearly not reliant on passing trade, this is either a posh b&b or a great value boutique hotel depending on your pretentions. Whichever, it's very good. Large Georgian rooms tastefully decorated, with the odd wacky light fitting here and there to add a touch of quirkiness. Great location for the city centre. Welcoming host and a very good breakfast. Recommended.",5,2012,08,17
216,Dublin two nights,"Hotel has everything, good location excellent staff and room accomadations.  Best breakfast of our two weeks in ireland.Had family with us daughter son and two granddaughters.  Were put uo in wonderful family room. Close in to all dublin city attractions within walking distance.",5,2012,08,16
216,Loved our stay,"Great staff, great location, contemporary (which we love), amazing breakfasts (set the tone for the great meals we had in Ireland - and the way they served at long table led to some very friendly conversation). I can't wait to go back.",5,2012,07,31
216,Excellent Dublin boutique hotel,"I had an excellent experience at Number 31 at the beginning of July. Firstly, the location of the hotel is excellent, with all major sights within walking distance meaning that public transport and/or taxis just aren't necessary. The hotel is within the Georgian district of Dublin with its long rows of grand red brick terraces and wide streets.

The Georgian house in which I stayed has a lot of character and the rooms are very tastefully furnished. The beds are very comfortable (which really helps when you are suffering from jet lag!) and the rooms are spacious enough considering the age of the house. Probably the only downsides of the room I stayed in were that it was a little noisy because it faced Fitzwilliam Place and the shower in the bathroom tended to leak water onto the floor when in use. This is understandable given the difficulties in converting a Georgian house to a hotel.

As lots of others have said, the breakfast is superb with a huge range of choices and is large enough such that you only need a small snack at lunch to keep you going. The cooked choices (full Irish, smoked salmon and scrambled eggs, porridge, eggs benedict and some others) were very tasty and best of all is served with a side of delicious home made soda bread. Plus you get to meet some very interesting people around the communal table (pity there were so many fellow Aussies though!)

The staff and particularly the owner, Noel, couldn't have been more helpful, whether in giving suggestions for Dublin or with little things like restaurant tips. One thing that is golden if you have a rental car is that Number 31 has its own parking spaces around the corner - when you see how many cars get clamped you'll appreciate how valuable this is!

Overall I was very happy with my stay at Number 31 which really added to my Dublin experience. Yes it's expensive but worth it in my view.",5,2012,07,27
216,dumped in dublin,"Despite having a confirmed reservation (made over one month in advance) AND having made the necessary deposits, two friends and I arrived after a 20 hour journey at Number 31 to learn from the owner that that he had cancelled our reservation. His explanation-  he had received an email from someone peripheral to our group and unknown to me canceling their room.  Without even so much as an email or query to me, he cancelled my confirmed reservation and upon our arrival, we were left to look refuge elsewhere.  

The result- instead of enjoying the sights of Dublin, we spent the first day scrambling to find a hotel.  The Westin, centrally located and accommodating staff, moved heaven and earth to accommodate us for the first two days.  No such luck for night three,  when we had to take our party 20 miles north of town.   

While I'm sure Number 31 is fine, my recommendation to all potential guests is to go ahead and make a back-up reservation at another hotel.  Don't ""assume"" that your confirmed reservation and deposit will ""score"" you a room.",1,2012,07,26
216,A wonderful spot for touring Dublin,"We loved staying at Number 31. The location was tops, the room fit our needs and the bed was extremely comfortable, but most of all, the staff could NOT have been more helpful, upbeat, and welcoming. We loved the ""family table"" for breakfast where we met interesting fellow guests and shared ideas about what to do while in Dublin. A great spot!  

As with the previous review, we were also on the 4th floor - a good cardio workout that entitled one to at least a single breakfast scone with no guilty thoughts.  The room was small but perfectly adequate.  Wireless was reliable, everything clean and fresh.  My only complaint?  The towels bore an uncomfortable resemblance to sandpaper......",4,2012,07,23
216,A lovely place to stay in Dublin,"Wonderful and very helpful staff. Owner very involved. Lovely room, unique designed bath.
The only down side is finding it. Direction tell you to turn into the close. By a restaurant that is no longer there. 
Breakfast wonderful. I'd give it 5 stars",5,2012,07,23
216,"Nice decor, fabulous breakfast, slightly overpriced","We stayed in Dublin for three nights at the beginning of our trip and one night at the end. This was our last night in Dublin and Number 31 got such amazing reviews that I wanted to try it out. It was difficult to find (it's disguised as an apartment) and our room was on the 4th floor with no elevator (if I wasn't pregnant it would have been just fine). The style of the hotel was deep purples and yellows and was very soothing and homey. Naturally, the award-winning breakfast was the best part of our stay here. It is a very nice hotel, we just didn't think it should be three or four times the price of most Ireland hotels.",4,2012,07,19
216,Maggie & Rich,"My husband and I spent four days in Dublin and stayed in this absolutely delightful hotel.  We had read about it in Karen Brown's travel guide to Ireland.  The review of the hotel was excellent and our own experience was even better.  The location was ideal - an easy walk to just about everywhere.  The building and the room was lovely.  Just perfect.  The breakfasts were just fabulous!  But the very best thing about the hotel was the proprietor, Noel.  He was the quintessential Irish gentleman.  And not just a gentleman.  A raconteur, a comic, an absolute gem!  He made every single morning a delight with his bonhomie and racy wit.  The only downside to our visit is how sad we were to leave.  We loved the rest of our travels in Ireland but nothing was as much fun as staying at this charming inn!",5,2012,07,16
216,Visit to Number 31,"Our review is mixed ...the layout of this hotel was very nice. Location was great, staff very friendly and helpful the breakfast was fantastic. Our beds were comfortable and place was clean.the price of this hotel was high and for that reason we feel the bathroom we had was so dark we couldn't get ready in it. It was a bit warm and humid  and although we could  open windows it would have been nice to at least have ceiling fans and we did need to sleep with ear plugs to muffle the noise from the street as well as the birds from the park. Hey do a very nice job but for the price it think they should update some of the room features.",4,2012,07,09
216,"Yes, it is the best breakfast in Dublin","Stayed here 3 nights at the end of our vacation in Ireland and really liked the homey atmosphere, comfortable rooms and more than anything the awesome breakfast. They lay out an incredible spread for a B&B: fresh fruit, homemade bread, yogurt, rhubarb compote, 6 types of cereal, coffee in a french press, tea and toast. Then they top that off with incredible hot breakfast choices. Definitely try the porridge. Fantastic. 
The location is a short 5 minute walk to St. Stephen's Green and across the park from Grafton Street and all the action. It's in a quiet business neighborhood but there is some street noise, so be prepared. 
Next door is a great little gym with 15 Euro guest passes too. 
Next time I'm in Dublin, even for business, I'm skipping the usual hotels and staying here. Everything I need and even convenient to the airport bus.",4,2012,07,03
216,"Very good service, room needs some updating","The hotel is located on the south part of town, a 5 minute walk to St Stephen's Green which makes it convenient to walk around town if a bit to far from the north part of town, and about 20 minutes from Trinity College and all the locations nearby. Most cabs dont know where the B&B is located so carry the address in writing. 
Arriving is a bit odd, it is on a side street, and you have to ring the door and wait. However, they do get you in quickly, and if you are lucky to arrive in the morning, get a wonderful complimentary breakfast.
The breakfast is served upstairs daily, has some cerelas and fruits, and a made to order hot plate with multiple options, quite good. 
You have two areas to chose a room, carriage house which is newer, the older part of the house seems nicer (I stayed there). Very high ceiling, large room, nice furniture although some of the pieces look worn out, and the mattress needs updating/replacing. Four free water bottles daily in room, but no fridge. No airconditioning but it did not seem needed.
The service is very good and charming, the owners and staff are very polite and pleasant, and will help you with reservations, let you use their computer, provide free internet, and everything you might need. 
They do leave someone in the kitchen area presumably 24/7 (I did get help late at night once, around midnight). 
So, despite the fact it is a bit farther from downtown thatn the more traditional hotels, breakfast is great, service is charming, (some) rooms a lot larger for the same price, I was very happy with my choice.",4,2012,07,03
216,Unbelievably Wonderful,"We spent two nights at Number 31, and they were likely the two finest nights of lodging of our two week trip to Ireland and Scotland.  Noel and his staff were gracious, helpful, and great company.  Breakfasts exceeded all expectations.  Dining and pub recommendations were spot on.  Simply a most enjoyable stay.",5,2012,06,29
216,What a wonderful week.,"From the moment our host helped us from our car and got us tea we knew that we were home. Our room had a private garden, and was lovely.  The hospitality is unendingly gracious. Greeting other guests at a delicious breakfast adds adds to the delight. Altogether a perfect stay.",5,2012,06,24
216,Great host!,"This is a great hotel where you can walk everywhere from the front door. Our room was clean but I thought it a bit small for the price. We only had a shower in the bathroom and there was no counter space. We had a superior room. The bed was extremely comfortable. Noel is a great host and will tell you everything you need to know and how to get around. The staff are friendly and the breakfasts are amazing. The fruit is a welcome treat and the toast, jam and eggs Benedict are melt in you mouth delicious! ",4,2012,06,23
216,A wonderful stay and amazing breakfast,"I was at Number 31 for 2 nights and the welcome (even if late in the evening) was very good. I was shown into the room and provided with a wifi free password for 24 hours. The room was very spacious and the bed comfortable...the TV may not have been huge but in Dublin you spend more time outside then inside. Breakfast was really good and the host was extremely friendly and welcoming.
Various books are available for the guests and can be taken at any time during the stay. I plan to be there again in a week and look forward to the breakfast (full Irish) immensely.

Position is central and near to everything...so you can just move around by foot.

I highly recommend this hotel.",5,2012,06,21
216,A comfortable stay,"No one seems to mention in previous reviews what a difficult place Number 31 is to find when you are driving yourself!  It is not for the faint hearted even with a GPS.  The main entrance to the hotel is in a very small lane.  From my point of view, I would only recommend this hotel if you are arriving in a taxi!  Apart from this hiccup, Noel was very welcoming and gave us a good run down on the layout of Dublin and the various sites to be visited.  Our room was large and comfortable and, as everyone has commented on, the breakfasts are spot on.  We'll be forever grateful for the recommendation to eat at ""The Sussex"" above O'Brien's Pub, a short stroll from Number 31.  What a great place with an Irish vibe about it and the best food imaginable for the weary travellers that we were.",4,2012,06,21
216,Excellent B&B convenient location,"Excellent B&B about four blocks south of St Stephen's Green. Charming Georgian, although rooms are a bit dated but comfortable. Very friendly and helpful hosts and outstanding breakfast. Highly recommend.",5,2012,06,20
216,Great value and lovely staff,"My stay at Number 31 was wonderful. The rooms were cozy and clean, the breakfast was delicious, and the owner and staff of the hotel were very kind and helpful. Great value as well. I would definitely recommend staying at Number 31!",5,2012,06,19
216,Very enjoyable stay,"We just stayed three nights in Dublin at the No 31.  We had a very quiet ground floor room that was maintained immaculately by the staff.  Noel (owner) was very friendly and helpful.  The breakfasts were wonderful - I recommend the frittata. My wife loved to hear Noel say ""frittata"" with his Irish brogue! We caught some marginal weather for two of the three days.. but we found the fun in the temple bar area - great pubs and live music everywhere. Treated ourselves to an upscale dinner at Marco Pierre White's Steak House  on Dawson Street (reservation suggested). The $steaks$  were incredible, the staff very friendly.  We did the evening dinner at the Brazen Head Pub with the Irish storyteller -it was a great way to close out our tour of Dublin.  Transportation recommendations - the Number 145 city bus stops right across from the hotel on Leeson Street 1,40E per person will take you into town with frequent stops and all the way to Heuston Station on the west side of town if need be.  No need of excessive walking required.   Runs every ten minutes until 9pm then every 20 min.  ( coins only on the city bus) or a  smartcard pass if you have it. Also airport coach bus for 7E per person beats 30E taxi fare out to the airport.",5,2012,06,07
216,Perfect start and end to our Ireland trip,"Number 31 was recommended by a personal friend, and although it was a little pricey for me, we decided to book it for 3 nights.  What a great decision!  The host welcomed us with open arms and pulled us in for breakfast after our AM arrival.  The food is absolutely delicious (try the porridge)!  We had both large and small rooms during this stay, but all were clean and well appointed, with beautiful linens and very comfortable beds and pillows.  The central lobby has a peat fire , which is nice, and there's a pretty garden outside between the 2 buildings.  Service was great.  The location, near St. Stephen's Green, was fabuous.  Thank you, Noel, for a wonderful stay and great memories for all of us.",5,2012,05,31
216,I give them a 32.,"After a much-delayed flight and a semi-harrowing trying-to-learn-driving-on-the-left-while-jet-lagged drive in, we were greeted at the door by Noel, who grabbed our bags and told us to have a seat while he got us some coffee and cookies and parked our car.  A nice start.  After relaxing by the fire for a few minutes sipping good French press coffee while he checked us in, he led us to our room, insisting to carry our bags.  Glad I didn't protest - 72 steps to the top in the Georgian side of the property.  Everything was lovely, breakfasts were outstanding, both recommended dinner restaurants were right on, sightseeing advice was excellent.  Breakfast: ""You have the choice of the full Irish, a cheese omelette, a mushroom frittata, Eggs Benedict, the smoked salmon, grilled kippers, and not forgetting the lowly bowl of porridge.""  Did I get that right?  I might have left something out.  It was all fresh and delicious.  Mmmmmm.

Since I was quality testing upwards of a half-gallon of Guinness a day, the stairs were a proper and deserved punishment, and not a problem for us, but if you have any multiple-step aversions and are planning ahead, you might want to request a lower room when you book.

To conclude our stay, Noel brought our car around to the door and parked it pointing in the right direction (which is not to say the right side of the road).

Highly recommended, especially for the ""Lonely Planet""-type of tourist.  You won't find a warmer welcome.",5,2012,05,29
216,Cross between B&B/Hotel,"Like one reviewer, I find it difficult writing this. I did a lot of research where to stay. I'm sure I came across this property being listed as a B&B but somehow forgot/ignored it. This property is a cross between a B&B and hotel. We arrived very early from our flight and was welcomed by the night/early morning desk man. We waited for another hour until breakfast was served. They get five stars for their breakfast.  As our room wasn't ready, we decided to walk around Dublin and returned in the afternoon to nap. While everyone was very nice, friendly and accommodating, I felt rushed when I asked questions. The room was small and near the entrance. The ceiling was low so when someone above us was walking in heels, it was loud. This may sound petty but I couldn't find a pen and paper in the room to use. I'm sure if I requested it, they would've given it to me. The point is, I shouldn't have to request it. For 190 Euros/night, it's the little details that count. Also there is no safe in the room to use.",4,2012,05,26
216,Fantastic Breakfast and beautiful rooms,"This review is very difficult to write as this is not your average hotel.  Every morning I would look forward to breakfast which was fantastic.  Also the building itself is special as is the original artwork which makes you feel right at home as opposed to a regular hotel. The hosts are great to speak with in the mornings and really take care to help out with taxis to airport and checking out early.  Keep in mind, this is not your regular hotel, checking in was very unpleasant;  we were offered a pot of tea to enjoy on arrival but we just wanted to get into our room after the day of travelling from London. We were rushed over to the adjacent building and consider that my wife walks with a crutch, no one helped with our bags.  My son and I can manage alone with the bags but we were literally rushed, up and down stairs and through the courtyard.  There is no tea or coffee making facilities in the room on any individual heating controls as we would find in most hotels in this price range.  The location itself is not bad, but it is a few minutes further on foot than most, however it is quieter. These negatives can be overlooked due to beautiful rooms and did I mention the best breakfast you can imagine. The only reason I did not rate this 5 stars is due to the person at check in.",4,2012,05,25
216,"Very Welcoming, But Small Room!","We stayed at the Number 31 in Dublin Ireland May 24 thru May 28.  We chose it because of reviews on Trip Advisor.  When we arrived we were pleasantly surprised at how nice and accommodating everyone was.  They welcomed us with breakfast (and it was excellent) and helped us to our room.  The host is friendly and extremely nice.

After the nice welcome, we had high hopes for the room.  However I have to say for the price we are playing 230 euros a night I feel the room is very small and we are situated right at then entrance where people come in.

Other than that the location was perfect.",4,2012,05,24
216,Great B & B,"We stayed here twice on our trip to Ireland.  We were able to get checked in early on our first day in Ireland and they treated us to coffee, tea and scones when we arrived.  Our luggage was taken to our large room that overlooked the small patio/garden.  The breakfast was outstanding with too many items to list.  Our last 2 days in Dublin was also at Number 31.  Again, everything couldn't have been better.  Thanks Noel for all you did for us.",5,2012,05,21
216,Good B&B in the centre of Dublin,"We picked up this property from tripadvisor, and so decided for a change to stay here instead of a branded hotel.

The previous reviews have remarked on the residential feel of the property and that is absolutely true. The entrance leads to this sunken lobby and a very warm and informal checkin process. The breakfasts are excellent; tea and coffee are available at any time at the kitchen.

Just bear in mind this is a B&B and not a hotel, so room service or meals are not available. The closest cafes or pubs are at the end of the street, about 10 minutes walk away. A little further, on the other side of St. Stephen's Green there is a wide selection of shopping and food.

The place is well located and the rooms are good. There is no lift so if you have heavy luggage be prepared to carry it up the stairs. All in all a good stay.",4,2012,05,18
216,Amazing!,"My partner and I stayed at Number 31 in April for four days and truly was one of the best experiences I have ever had! From the very first moment we arrived it was great. Our plane shockingly landed EARLY and we made it to the hotel prior to breakfast ending. We had flown all night and were hungry but not expecting to make it, and as soon as we arrived we were whisked away by the nicest staff in town who served a full made-to-order Irish breakfast with tea and coffee. Not only was the food spectacularly good, but every person working there was incredibly nice. Our room was fantastic, with a sitting area and little private garden. The owners couldn't be kinder and helped orient us to the city and gave great food recommendations. The location was great, right off of St Stephens Green and it was easy to get around. Did I mention there is a fire burning in a fireplace everyday, just for that extra touch? It was a trip of a lifetime for us and the staff and accommodations at Number 31 were a big part of that! Thank you so much!!",5,2012,05,12
216,The best in Dublin.,"Arriving tired and with a little cold from the long plane ride, met at door by an exuberant host.  This man really understands what hotel keeping and customer service is all about.  I wasn't wild about my room at first, right near the front door and the reception area.  Spoke to Noel, who reassured me it would be a little noisy only during that hour of the day.  He was right.  At any other hotel I would have moved my room, but not here.  The room was an architectural jewel, living up to form not necessarily following function.  If I had any complaint it would be that the water in the bathroom sink doesn't always make it into the sink unless it's turned on a little high, and anyone over the age of 65 and out of shape might have a difficult time climbing into the magnificent bathtub.  Charmed by the skylight in the room and the gulls who decided to alight on it from time to time.  Location seems a little dicey, until you realize you're a block from St. Stephen's Green and the major areas of Dublin.  Breakfast was fantastic. Loved it and would definitely return.  If they had room (they're very busy).",5,2012,05,07
216,"Luxurius and charming, but...","For sure is Noel Comer a nice and charming host and it definitively tries hard to make you feeling at home. Upon checking in for our two night stay he personally welcomed us with a cup of tea and bisquits and shared with us lots of informations about how and where to go to discover Dublin's  attractions, almost all comfortably and wonderfully located within walking distance from the guesthouse. He insisted to personally bring our luggages across the nice small garden in the courtyard, through the internal passageway and up the stairs into the 2. floor of the beautiful Georgian building where our room was located. The room itself was large, clean and furnished with style and taste. It has a high ceiling, surrounded by a wooden frame,  features a fireplace, a comfortable double bed and counts several design furniture items (e.g. 2 Poltrona Frau leather armchairs).  The bathroom, which is built inside of the original room's layout,  was a bit small with just a fix shower appliance (no bath tub) but offered the extra comfort of a heated floor. Breakfast is served on the first floor of the check-in area (i.e. the building located on Leeson Close, as the Georgian building is located opposite to it and faces Fitzwilliam place) either inside or in a porch oustide. Staff is friendly and the breakfast offers a variety of cereals, fruits and hot dishes.
The achille's heel of our room (and our reason for the ""average"" overall rating) is definitively it's exposure to noise: we had both inside noise (water loudly flowing from the above plumbing, chatter in the corridors and from neighbour rooms) as well as ouside noise (cars, honks, sirens and from people on the street). All in all a positive experience but I can easily understand that individual sensibility, guest politeness and room location/situation/difference can greatly influence the quality of your stay.",3,2012,05,06
216,"""In Dublin's fair city ... ""","I absolutely LOVE Number 31.  We spent 3 nights here and I could not have asked for a better place to stay in Dublin.  It is a great place to rest weary bones and tired feet!  Tucked away in a quiet corner of Dublin and yet close to St Stephens Green, Trinity College and other major sights, Number 31 is a serene, comfortable lodging with an unbelievable breakfast.  Our room (Room 10, I think) was quite large and beautifully furnished.  The bathroom also was large with a great shower.  Number 31 has a very ""Zen-like"" feeling.  We also cannot say enough about our host, Noel - he was great - charming, entertaining, helpful, interesting, warm, friendly and had great suggestions for dinner to boot (The Sussex, La Pont and Canal Bank)!  

We flew into Dublin and we were ""wheels down"" at 6:36 AM.  By 7:30 AM, we were having a hot breakfast at Number 31 and were in our room before 9:00 AM.  What a pleasant introduction to Dublin.  

Let me tell you, this is one cool place with a great host.  Next time I visit Ireland I'll go back to Dublin just to stay at Number 31.",5,2012,05,06
216,Beautifully designed up market B&B with superb breakfast and wonderfully hospitable hosts.,"Wouldn't hesitate to recommend this wonderfully stylish place. Bedrooms and common areas are modern but sympathetic to the period features. Good location, easy walk to the centre but not in the thick of things. Fantastic breakfast and hosts with real Irish charm! A real find. ",5,2012,04,30
216,Felt like being at home,"After calling through earlier in the week we informed the owners we were expecting to arrive at 10.30am, when we arrived they had not only got the room ready early but had also arranged for us to have a late breakfast, a great one at that and a nice touch
Number 31, is really like living in someones home, fantastic breakfasts, lovely courtyard garden which our very quiet room overlooked and you have a key to come and go as you please 
A truly memorable stay, great hosts, really useful info given to tour the city, great position as walkable to the city centre in 5-10 minutes through St. Stephens Green, very near the canal for romantic walks and a beautiful room, will stay again when in Dublin, just can`t fault",5,2012,04,27
216,"Absolute perfection, from start to finish","Let me say, from the get go (in case you'd like to save yourself from having to read an overly gushy and positive review), I loved everything about this hotel and cannot recommend it highly enough. I only wish I could give it a rating higher than Excellent. My next trip to Ireland will likely focus on the west coast, rather than Dublin, but it will absolutely include at least one (or more!) night in Dublin, just so I can stay at Number 31. Okay, now on to the review. 

I recently spent 4 days in Dublin and stayed at Number 31 and it was one of the highlights of the trip. I'd spent countless hours researching exactly where to stay and Number 31 (and it's ridiculous number of rave reviews!) was always sort of at the top of my list. But, I was a bit dubious -- how could this hotel really be as good as everyone was saying it was? I finally decided to bite the bullet when, on a bit of a lark, I stopped into a bookstore in London (my stop before Dublin), picked up a book and Dublin and it opened right to the page about Number 31 (with more rave reviews). That seemed like enough of a sign that maybe this place just might be a good spot.

""Good"" doesn't begin to describe it. From the moment I walked through the mews door, through the front garden and into the living room/lobby, I felt as though I were at home. Rather than being rushed through check-in and tossed a key to my room with nary a smile (as I'm pretty used to when staying at chain hotels), I was invited to set my bags down, offered coffee or tea (coffee, please!) and encouraged rest and relax in front of the fireplace. I can't express the overwhelming feeling of ""welcome"" that I felt. But this isn't a typical matronly B&B. Oh no. This is mod and chic. With my coffee in hand (the first of many pots of French press I consumed during my stay), I walked around the living room, ogling everything and trying to figure out how to recreate that perfect combination of modern and rustic, worn-in and clean in my own home. Oh! And the smell! The room had the most amazingly intoxicating and lingering smell from the daily lighting of the fireplace. I loved it. 

Before I was walked to my room, I was given a map and terrific directions on how to get around town, as well as tips for fun things to do. It was a really nice touch, especially because it was my first time in town and I wasn't really familiar with all that the city has to offer.

(As an aside, before I'd traveled, I kept hearing about how the Irish have a reputation for being nice, and from the moment I landed until the moment I left, I have to say, it was absolutely true. I hate to make grand generalizations about people from a certain place, but every single person I met there was so nice and friendly and hospitable!)

Number 31 is actually two buildings -- the mid-century mews building (which includes the kitchen/dining area, as well as the aforementioned living room, and several guest rooms) and a 4 story Georgian town house -- connected by a to-die-for garden. Before I get to my room (on the top floor of the Georgian town house, facing onto Fitzwilliam Place), I have to comment on the general decor which, in a word, is spectacular. In every nook, hallway, stairwell and landing of the town house, there are incredible seating areas and the whole space (including the guest rooms) is decked out in a combination of mid-century and turn-of-the-century. You can tell that A LOT of attention and care has been paid to the space, and the guest rooms are no different.

On to the room! First, and probably most importantly for a hotel: the bed! It was the most comfortable bed I've slept in and I slept better for the three nights in Dublin than I have a really long time. What a treat! The room was decorated simply and cleanly, without any tacky ""hotel art"". Rather, it had an amazing original work by an Irish artist, floor to ceiling windows that let in loads of light (and came with plush, light-blocking curtains, in case sunlight isn't your thing), comfy chairs and lots of storage. The bathroom is completely renovated and modern, and has just the right combination of classic and contemporary touches and finishes. 

So, now that I've gotten through the welcome, the decor and the room, I have to comment on the breakfast that supposedly the ""best in Dublin"". Well, I can't say for sure it's the best, because it was the only breakfast I ate in Dublin and you would have to pay me good money to go somewhere else. The dining area is made of two large rooms (both with huge family-style dining tables), one of which is in a solarium overlooking the mews entrance. As with the rest of the space, the dining area has both rustic and modern touches (natural wood tables with crisp white linens and tableware, surrounded by Eames style chairs and lush green plants). In the background, you'll hear the staff making breakfast to order while the chat and laugh with one another, truly seeming to enjoy one another's company and their jobs. If you've ever had a good dining (or hotel) experience come to a screeching halt because it's clear the staff hates being there (and you start to think, ""hmm, if they hate it here, maybe I should too!""), you'll appreciate the warmth and friendliness of everyone at Number 31. And the breakfast really is as good as everyone says it is. I've been craving the cranberry-orange bread, Irish soda bread, coffee, eggs Benedict and full Irish since the moment I left. Yum! 

Dublin is an incredibly easy city to get around. It takes, at most, 30 minutes to walk to the farthest point of the city centre. You can also catch one of the very plentiful taxis or use the buses. But walking is really the best way to see the city. Between Number 31 and the city centre is the famous St. Stephen's Green and it makes for a most excellent route. 

I could go on (and on and on) about my stay at Number 31, but I'll end simply by saying that it was absolute perfection, from start to finish.",5,2012,04,22
216,"Great house, rooms, atmosphere, location and breakfast in the heart of Dublin","Wonderful architectural home carefully run and loved by friendly and skilled owners with great breakfast. Very close to some of the best food, bars and sights of Dublin city. Highly recommended. Stayed in room 14. ",5,2012,04,22
216,"2 troubled nights with pigeons in the attic, but nice hotel","Overall nice hotel with friendly owners. However anything out of the standard welcome procedures will be dealt with less priority. Especially disappointed about the handling of a restless night experience. While we did let us convince in the morning that the all night concert of tip-taps and  twitters were from (baby) pigeons and not mice, did not quite understand why we had return for a second night of all night noise. Despite a very promising ""we take care of it"" and acknowledgement that ""they are back"", nothing was done and neither were we informed about the fail of taking care nor was compensation ever an option. Location is excellent, rooms are up to expectations, breakfast is excellent, maybe a bit pricey for what you get. But overal experience largely influenced by bad nights sleep. Avoid rooms on highest floor to stay safe of the noise.",2,2012,04,22
216,It's like staying with family...only better!,"What a wonderful place to stay while in Dublin! Upon arrival, we were greeted by Deirdre who immediately offered us coffee, tea, and hot chocolate for our daughters. What a wonderful first impression! We sat in a beutiful sunken in living room, and prepared for our full day in Dublin. We were then shown to our rooms by Noel, who told us everything we needed to know about navigating Dublin during our short visit. Our rooms were spectacular! Very modern, well decorated, and super spacious. The beds were soft, and the rooms were quite in the evening. The next morning, we had one of THE best breakfasts ever-- eggs benedict (myself), traditional irish breakfasts (my 2 daughters), and a vegetable frittata (my wife). There were also a variety of cereals, fruit, and yogurt, in addition to coffee and fresh squeezed orange juice! YUM!! 

Noel and his wife are excellent hosts. They treat you like family from the moment you step foot into their property. Unfortunately, we only stayed for one night, but it was certainly one of the best nights and B&B's we've ever stayed in. We will definitely be back when our travels take us back to the beautiful city of Dublin!  Thanks for such a wonderful stay!!",5,2012,04,18
216,Great Hotel in Dublin and incredible Breakfast,"It is Great place to stay. Noel and the staff of this hotel have done an excellent work, but specially I would like to recommend Breakfast. Either you go for the Full Irish or Eggs Benedict or the Vegetarian, Breakfast is awesome. Rooms are clean and loved the fact they are in separate building from the Lobby and Dining area. It is well located 10 minutes walking from Graffton Street and St. Stephens Green. I Stayed there 2 nights and we got complementary breakfast as soon as we walked in the first day. Great Service. I Strongly Recommend the Eggs Benedict.",5,2012,04,12
216,Breakfast will make you cancel any lunch plans you had!,"Booked this hotel as a yeah why not, they say they have the best breakfast the rest does not matter as I am a happy man on a full stomach! From the moment we arrived, we were shown to breakfast (arrival at 9.15am) and by 10.30am we were in our room! I can not say much else that has not been said, but what I will say is this. You can tell the quality and the pride of the owners when the staff seem so happy especially the cleaning staff. To hear them laughing and joking amongst themselves just goes to show they enjoy working for the place. And to me, if your staff are happy, they will always be happy to help the customer. Yes it is a little on the step side cost wise, and yes they miss the odd bit here and there but to me, it was just a laid back, happy go lucky break.",5,2012,04,11
216,lived like locals in luxury,"we highly recommend this lovely hotel, with excellent service and a breakfast worth its weight in gold. the service was welcoming, relaxed and mature. our rooms were quiet and sophisticated. we were able to enter and exit through our own entrance. it was like staying with family. we would certainly return.",5,2012,04,09
216,Tops in hospitality and service,"This out of the way B&B is fantastic. I loved everything from the lovely lobby area with comfortable seating and a roaring fire in the fireplace to the evening tea and the amazing breakfasts. The staff assisted us in  from tour scheduling to taxi reservations. All their advice on attractions, pubs, etc was on target",4,2012,04,08
216,True hospitality,"We stayed at Number 31 in August 2010.  We could not have enjoyed our stay more.  I usually choose bed and breakfasts by the description of the breakfast, because I feel that when owners care about the food they serve, they care about their customers.  I hit the jackpot with Number 31.  Noel was one of the kindest B&B owners we have met.  My children (10 and 14 at the time) were treated so nicely and our rooms were well-appointed and comfortable.  Number 31's location is excellent as well.  We enjoyed walking all over Dublin, and strolled around St. Stephen's Green frequently during our 4 day stay.  You can't go wrong with Number 31!",5,2012,03,28
216,Our favorite hotel in Dublin,"We visit family every few years, and Number 31 is by far our favorite hotel in Ireland. Noel and his wife are wonderfully charming. The team who works with them is very professional. The rooms are lovely, the location perfect, and the breakfasts are amazing. Unfortunately, they were booked for the nights we wanted to go this June, but they were kind enough to forward a recommendation. I am sad we will miss them. I highly recommend staying at Number 31 when visiting Dublin!",5,2012,03,27
216,What a great find!,"I came here for St Patrick's day and truly enjoyed my stay, thanks mostly to the great hospitality  of Noel and his staff. You are made to feel like having your own private Georgian home in one of the prettiest residential areas in Dublin, and within walking distance to the main parts of town.

Though arriving well before check-in time, I was promptly whisked to the breakfast area, where for the following days I enjoyed the best cooked early morning meals of my entire life. You get to eat so much here that you simply can't even think about lunch. And I must say I have been to a handful of good restaurants in Dublin, and never was the soda bread as good as the one home cooked here.

Rest assured that Number 31 is not a ""breakfast with rooms"". The hotel is tastefully decorated throughout, the beds are super comfortable and the rain shower superb. Noel will give you great tips on what to see, do and where to eat, and during my whole stay I was able to go mostly everywhere walking.

Though there are many options hereby, I ended up dining most nights at Ranelagh village, a bit off the beaten path but closely reached via the Luas tram. I had 3 excellent dinners in this neighborhood and there were plenty of other options available. 

It was my first time in Ireland and Number 31 really made it a lot more enjoyable. I will certainly stay here next time around, I just with they would ship me that soda bread here at home. Thank you Noel!",5,2012,03,26
216,"Friendly, individual and highly recommended","We stayed for four nights and thoroughly enjoyed it.  Really excellent breakfasts.  You eat at communal tables which is great for meeting and chatting to other guests.  Noel the owner is a very friendly and obliging host.  Other staff are great too.  Free wi-fi.  Complementary tea and coffee served in the lounge area.  Nice bedrooms in a Georgian house.

It's about 5 mins walk from St Stephen's Green, so near enough to everything if you don't mind a bit of (pleasant) walking. Some rooms are on Fitzwilliam Place which is quite a busy road.  Worth asking for a room overlooking the garden if you like peace and quiet.  And if you are on the top floor you will have about 80 stairs to climb to get up to your room (no lifts).  But these are minor things.  It's a great place to stay and highly recommended.",4,2012,03,21
216,A unique experience,"Number 31 offers the best of both worlds.  A contemporary house combined with Georgian style elegance. Neol and his team make you feel very welcome at his boutique style guest house. Breakfast is a delight, I just wished I always had time to enjoy it.  The property is well located with a number of good eating places for dinner a short walk away, along with some very genuine Irish bars.  As there are two very different styles of bedroom, if you want the Georgian townhouse experience, then you need to ask for one of those rooms on booking as you may be disappointed.",4,2012,03,20
216,"Incredible Experience, Amazing Breakfast, Lots of Character","My boyfriend and I checked into Number 31 as the first day of a week in Dublin. It could not have been a better place to start! To start, they offered us tea or coffee as we sat in a recessed living room area next to a cozy fireplace. Then we were shown our room -- it was in an old Georgian-style home, and they gave us a free upgrade! The room was large and cozy, and even had a fireplace in it. The owners are incredibly friendly -- Noel gave us a recommendation for lunch down the street at a place called Sussex Cafe and lunch there was SO delicious (and affordable!). The grounds are lovely to walk through as well, and the breakfast in the morning was just beyond words amazing. Everything's cooked to order -- my boyfriend's Full Irish was great, though my Eggs Benedict were a tad overcooked. But the best part of breakfast IMO is the pears soaked in vanilla! It's also a great location, just a few minutes behind St Stephens Green. It's not very central in that it's a bit of a walk from the Liffey, but it was about an €8 taxi ride back from the Temple Bar area. If (more like When!) we come back to Dublin we are definitely staying here! Definitely not just a place to rest your head; the memories from your stay here will add to your trip!",5,2012,03,17
216,Wish we had more than 1 night here!,"We loved the character of our room in the old Georgian styled home.  It was huge and had the most comfortable bed I've ever stayed on.  Breakfast was fantastic, the staff went out of their way to make sure we were comfortable during our stay.  The price was very reasonable and we loved that parking was included too.",5,2012,03,02
216,Best breakfast in the world!,"My husband and I recently stayed at No31 while we planned a ""get away from it"" weekend and was not disappointed by No31. The house is beautiful, tastefully decorated and spacious rooms. The host and staff are warm and welcoming and made you feel like nothing was to much to ask.
Great location and only a five minute walk to the centre of Dublin. 
What can we say about breakfast but ""the best ever""  So much choice and everything so nicely presented and very tasty.
You will not be disappointed if you book Number 31 and will defiantely go back again.",5,2012,02,27
216,Beautiful and Friendly,"We stayed at Number 31 just one night as we took a layover in Dublin on our way to Amsterdam, but this hotel suited us perfectly and went above my expectations.  We arrived very early in the morning, and received a complementary (candle-lit, as the sun wasn't due to rise for another hour) breakfast even though we weren't checking in for a few hours.  After breakfast the owner gave us the lowdown of the neighborhood and Dublin in general, picking out on a map the best attractions and places to eat in the one day we had in the city.  Our room was beautifully decorated, breakfast was as great as all of the other reviewers note, and we had a wonderful time.  We'll be back when we return for a tour of Ireland.",5,2012,02,12
216,Best breakfast in Ireland?,"Mife wife and I live in Dublin and are reasonably busy at the moment with two young children. No 31 had been recommended to us by a friend as an ideal place for a quiet night away (nana babysitting) with easy access to town and a great breakfast. I will not bore you with too long a description of all that is good about this place but at the same time I want to do it justice. Hosts: fantastic. The proprietor met us in person and attended to each and every one of our needs. Room; Extremely tastefully decorated with beautiful high ceilings and elaborate decor. Nice bathroom also. Bed very comfortable. Hotel in general is extremely interesting, a fine example of Georgian splendour with added bonus of famously designed mews building where breakfast is served. Breakfast: EXCEPTIONAL. The finest I have ever enjoyed. Fresh fruit (try the rhubarb fool/compote? to start) was the best I have ever tasted on these shores. The cooked breakfasts were exquisite (I have eggs Bendict cook to perfection and my wife had the scrambled eggs and smoked salmon). My only problem was that i was just staying for one day and couldn't try more. The location in town was also ideal. We had a pre-theatre dinner in One Pico and retired to the Shelboure for a few drinks.",5,2012,02,09
216,I will never stay anywhere else in Dublin again,"My 3 friends and I were in town to visit a conference for 3 days and from the moment we walked in the door we were made more than welcome by the friendliest hotel owner I have ever met. Despite our arrival time being before regular check in time, we sat us down with tea and cake and organised the room to be ready for us immediately. without much check in formalities we were given keys and showed key spots on the map, and taken to our room. Breakfast was delicious, it made me want to sneak the entire bowl of the homemade granola home and they made eggs fresh to order. Beds were comfortable, bathroom clean, great shower, and the building is just spectacular. Look no more, you simply must stay here.
5 out of 5 in every aspect.",5,2012,02,07
216,SHAGTASTIC BABY !,"Once in a really rare blue moon you stumble on a humdinger of a hotel and this is one of them.
Set in two separate buildings with a hidden garden between them it's a cross between Austin Powers groovy ( sunken lounge, white tiles, sixties ambience ) and old-style Georgian ornate that shouldn't really work but does beautifully.
Our room ( 19 ) was another mix of thrown-together furniture and high-tech bathroom that somehow worked brilliantly and from the moment we walked into the hotel to be met with the offer of a pot of tea by the legendary Noel to the excellent breakfast the following morning after a long night's carousing in the carousingist city of them all we couldn't find a single fault.
Free parking,a comfortable bed and excellent helpful hosts made this a proper hostelry.
This is a gem of a hotel just a Guinness-stagger away from St Stephen's Green and in an age of bland, faceless hotels it was, if you'll excuse the cliche, a home from home.
Especially if your home is groovy baby !",5,2012,02,07
216,My friends recommendations were spot on!,"A lovely boutique hotel a few minutes walk from the city center. Kind and passionate staff, incredible breakfast. I won't consider any other accommodations when I return to Dublin.",4,2012,01,30
216,Lovely stay at Number 31,"I stayed five nights at Number 31 in January 2012. I really enjoyed my stay, it really felt like staying in someones home. The staff were friendly and helpful, the breakfast amazing and my room had its own private garden! The best part, however, was the bed! I don't think I've ever slept in a better bed! It was simply amazing!

The only problem was the door to my room, it was incredibly difficult to unlock the door! I probably spent at least a minute trying to unlock every time! I notified one of the staff members, so hopefully it's been fixed already!",5,2012,01,26
216,Huge fan!,"I have never written a Trip Advisor review before, but feel the need to do so after staying at this hotel.  3 friends and I (2 Londoners & 2 from NYC) went for a quick New Year's trip & a major highlight was definitely Number 31.  It is absolutely beautiful and feels as if you're staying in someone's Georgian mansion.  The breakfast is completely amazing (as everyone on here has already said) and Noel & the rest of the hosts could not have been nicer, more informative or more accommodating.  It's also super close to everything you'll want to see & especially close to St. Stephen's Green park, which is gorgeous.  I think we only took a cab once in 5 days.  I've been telling everyone about this place so take my advice & stay here!",5,2012,01,19
216,Home away from home,"Amazing breakfast, beautiful historic buildings, friendly hosts, relaxing sitting room w fireplace. Being a little out of town means it's quiet, but a bit of a walk for shopping and sight-seeing. ",4,2011,12,10
216,"Unique, welcoming and exclusive small hotel experience in a big city!","Can I start off by saying that I don't especially like staying in hotels, especially big ones. I usually prefer the option of self catering, but good traditional self catering can be hard to find in bigger cities, and looked especially difficult to find in Dublin. We chose Number 31 as it looked to like the more bijoux/comfortable type of place that would be a happy compromise for us.

On arriving early before the 11am check-in, the owner Noel, swept us up to the breakfasting area, even although it wasn't part of the deal with a welcome that was warm and patently genuine. We felt at home immediately, and enjoyed an excellent well cooked breakfast that had unsurprisingly won 'Best In Ireland' a few years beforehand. I remember smiling to each other as Noel said proudly 'Look at that then', as he remarked proudly on the appealing platefuls we were presented with. The choice was fantastic and would suit all tastes. Nothing was too much trouble, and you knew from the start that this was going to be a pleasant and stress free stay. There was a decidedly international clientele staying at Number 31, which for me personally added to the atmosphere. Throughout the week Linda and the other staff members were unfailingly pleasant and helpful dealing with any request.

There is no need to repeat the details of the stylish 'Bondesque' sunken lounge area and the quality of the rooms and materials used throughout, as they have been amply detailed before. Maybe an 'honesty' bar wouldn't go amiss in the lounge area, as it was an incredibly cool and comfortable place to sit in front of the peat fire. There was a small inshot that looked as if it was a bar at one point, where Noel keeps all his tourist information maps and leaflets.

In the bedrooms the huge floating cloud lampshades were a talking point. The bathrooms were stylish and had an excellent rainshower. The plumbing is occasionally a bit creaky, but I suppose you'd expect that in an older building. Number 31 really is a very stylish and well thought out place, with two separate living areas, one in the main building and the other in a Georgian terraced building across the courtyard that subdivides them. You are given a key that enables you to leave the terraced building into Lower Fitzwilliam Street, so that you don't always need to traipse back through the main building. We stayed in the terraced block in Room 22 which was really nice and spacious with a chair and couch.

I have seen Number 31 described as both boutique hotel and stylish B&B, and to be honest I suppose it's a mixture of both. It would have been nice to have tea/coffee making facilities in the rooms, but I wouldn't die in a ditch over that minor inconvenience, as bottled water is provided. There is Wi-Fi (BitBuzz) which is a bit tricky at the start but has the added convenience of being widely used elsewhere in the city.

Number 31 is located very centrally, and is within 10 mins walk of the main parts of town and handy for both the museum and shopping areas. The Pearse Street DART(Train) is also 10 minutes away, and was good for going out of town for the day to visit some of the seaside towns like the beautiful Dalkey (which Noel and the girls suggested, as we were going to go to Dun Laighoaire-Dunleary) which I'd highly recommend, though I never saw Bono who lives there along with many other celebrities.  We had an excellent lunch in his local Finnegan's. There were some amazing pads in this place!

Overall, I found that Noel was one of the most knowledgable and hospitable hosts that you could ever come across, and found him a very interesting person to chat to. He has genuine warmth, which all his staff also have too. His helpful tips regarding Dublin were invaluable. So all the other good stuff you have read before in other reviews are true about the Number 31 crowd.

Noel had recommended Justin and Conor from dublinchauffeurs.com to ferry us back and forward in style from the airport and it was a great stress free way of getting back and forward in their executive cars at a reasonable price.

So, in summing up, I really wouldn't think about doing anything any differently if I returned to Dublin, and will be recommending this fantastic little place, not just to the other Trip Advisor readers but also to friends and family. Number 31 does initially appear quite pricey, but if you consider the beautiful breakfast you recieve to start you on your way then it's not really more expensive, and has an exclusive, intimate and comfortable feel to it, that most larger hotels will never have a hope of achieving.

Highly recommended and will hopefully return soon.",5,2011,12,05
216,Excellence,"If you want excellent personal service, accommodation to rival any 5 star hotel, a breakfast fit for Kings, a city centre location from where all attractions are within walking distance, then look no further. I need say no more...book and you shall discover. Thanks again Noel for your hospitality.",5,2011,12,04
216,"Wonderful, friendly, unique hotel","Stayed overnight for a quick business trip. Its a lovely bolt-hole of a hotel. I've stayed in Dublin before, and the hotels on St Stephen's Green itself can be a bit manic. This is different. Its down a tiny close, and feels almost like a private home, whilst only being 3 minutes walk from the Green itself. The reception area is beautiful - like something from a James Bond mountain retreat - with a great sunken sitting area and a wonderful log fire. The room itself was comfortable and stylish. The owners were wonderfully welcoming, helping sort taxis and giving advice. The breakfast the next morning was superb - all home cooked, fresh ingredients. The only reason I'm giving it 4 stars instead of 5 is that depending what you want it for, the more cozy feel, the lack of a bar say, can mean that it is more like a B&B where you tiptoe home, rather than feeling comfortable about coming back for drinks and a natter. A minor point though, and if you want supremely comfortable, friendly, relaxed and with a wonderful breakfast, then you should go here. I know I'll be back.",4,2011,11,25
216,Excellent once again,"I can't fault this boutique hotel/ Bed and breakfast. We & family members have stayed in various rooms, and they have everything you need and are nicely decorated and comfortable.
Breakfast is perfect for every taste, mine being fruit, my husbands being full Irish and bread. Home made. Noel as always was the perfect host, he's a well liked man. The driver who took us to the airport in the morning thought he was a great fella too. I'd never stay anywhere else in Dublin. If Noel's place  was full I'd come another time, rather than risk  staying somewhere else.",5,2011,11,23
216,"Warmest Welcome, Best Breakfast","We picked Number 31 for our recent trip to Dublin, based in part on Trip Advisor reviews.  So glad we did.  Two long blocks from St. Stephens Green, Number 31 is also part of a canal- adjacent neighborhood that features two good restaurants (The Sussex and the Canal Bank) and a pub (O'Brien's.)  We stayed in the Georgian house in a generously sized room overlooking the pretty garden.  Loved the juxtaposition of Georgian architectural detail and stylish contemporary furnishing.  Very comfortable bed.  (A small detail, but telling -  two suitcase racks were in the room.  So convenient.  Even the Ritz Carlton requires asking to provide more than one.)  Got a peek into one of the more contemporary rooms in the coach house which looked cozy and inviting - that renovation seems to have won recognition by Irish architects.  
Good as all that is, here's what made Number 31 truly memorable:
1) The warm welcome.  After the long trip from Los Angeles, we were offered coffee and delicious coffee cake in the sunken living room while our room was readied.  Then host Noel appeared to provide an orientation to the hotel and neighborhood, advice about getting around and enthusiasm for his city.  He was available throughout our stay and encouraging and helpful about our plan to drive to Glendaloch for a day.
2) The breakfasts.  Oh my.  Choose full Irish, lovely omelette or eggs benedict with smoked salmon, all cooked to order, or continental, or homey warm porridge with honey.   We covered a lot of Dublin on foot during our 6 days, fueled by Number 31 breakfast. 
But it's not just the food that makes breakfast special.  First morning, Noel scooted us through the serene indoor breakfast room onto the pretty glass-enclosed patio breakfast area and plunked us down at a communal table.  If you measured the quality of the establishment by the company alone, Number 31 would get very high marks.  Though not usually gregarious in the morning, we met wonderful people over the course of our stay - American expats living in Florence, a young couple from Norway on their first trip away from their children, a couple from Detroit with business in Brussels, a young U.S. State department couple stationed in Iraq and the London-based antique dealer/stylist/author of a newly published book about Irish houses ( we bought a copy of it - Essentially Irish - our favorite souvenir of the trip).  We might not have dined at the wonderful Winding Stair or taken in the Yeats exhibit at the National Library or attended the book signing at a local gallery without the benefit of those morning conversations.",5,2011,11,19
216,Lovely Hotel in Dublin!,"My husband and I stayed at Number 31 for our one-year wedding anniversary for three nights. The hotel is a beautiful updated Georgian Building and adjacent Coach House with a lovely courtyard connecting the two. The lobby is cozy, breakfasts are absolutely outstanding and made-to-order, and the staff is friendly and accommodating. The staff are more than happy to make us tea or coffee upon request. Our room at Number 31 was modern and simple with low lighting, a very comfortable bed, and a nice little bathroom with a rain shower. We found our room and bathroom pristinely clean and quite comfortable overall. It should be pointed out that the hotel does not have laundry services which was extremely problematic when we were stuck in the rain and drenched from head to toe and left with no way to dry our clothes and a flight in the morning. The hotel also does not have elevators, so be prepared to trudge up flights of stairs if you are on a high floor. Number 31 is also in a good location, close to St. Stephen's Green and Grafton Street for shopping. Overall, we had a very nice stay and would return to Number 31 on our next trip to Dublin.",5,2011,11,18
216,Gem in Dublin! Best B&B in Dublin!,"This is a wonderful bed and breakfast! My husband and I stayed seven nights and wished we could stay longer! Everything was wonderful- the room, the staff, the breakfast, and service were AMAZING! The breakfast was FABULOUS! I highly recommend staying here. It is well worth the money. If we come back to Dublin, we will definitely be staying at Number 31!",5,2011,11,13
216,"Perfect location, Noel is a perfect host","I don't think I have anything new to add really, but just to say this is our 4th stay with Noel and his wife at 31. We have always felt so welcome and as Noel says  as we arrive 'Welcome Home' and that's what it feels like, it's like being at home. Yes, there is no kettle in the room, but the room is a short walk away in the kitchen, and you can just help yourself to a drink. There is complimentary water in the room, one bottle of still and one carbonated water. Noel keeps a very handy map of Dublin in the sunken lounge area. I don't think there is anything that he's not thought about for his visitors comfort. On Saturday I ordered a cab to the airport for Sunday morning, and a nice hire car arrived, the driver had known Noel for years and told us Noel works 7 days a week, I expect that is why 31 runs so well, because he cares about getting it right, and he does get it right. I never want to leave and always look forward to returning. Room 11 has it own little garden , walled patio. Every room has something special, and the shower is a perfect size and that lovely big head on the shower, perfect. All the toiletries you need, face flannels, shower hat, tissues, hairdryer, shampoo, soap, body lotion.
When you check into your room, the bed side lights are on, which is so welcoming. Many times at other places it not until too late you switch the light on and it doesn't work, by having it on at check in it shows that the lights have been checked and are working. I feel every detail is looked at and checked, many large hotels are not this efficient. 
Dublin is a great city and this is a perfect place to stay",5,2011,11,06
216,Charming hotel with intimate atmosphere,Really a charming experience. Feels like a mix of a classy boutique hotel and visiting friends. You get a great greeting on arriving with freshly made tea and home made cookies to relax in the welcome. The staff are fantastic and make you feel special and awaited. They greet you as a long lost friend. The rooms are very nice. The best thing is the breakfast which is served in a conservatory. Try the oatmeal porridge with honey and you don't want anything else for breakfast for the rest of your life! The staff provide for excellent information on sites to see and general information in abundance but are never over eager to please in a false manner. You are left with a genuine feeling of pure Irish kindness.,5,2011,11,06
216,Fabulous !!!!!,"Fantastic hotel, perfect location and Noel was a wonderful host, he knows everything about Dublin :) would definitely stay there again !!",5,2011,11,05
216,lovely b and b but a little overpriced,"My boyfriend and I stayed for 1 night last weekend. I chose to stay in number 31 after reading serveral rave reviews about it. It is very cosy and full of character. There were lit tealights scattered everywhere which was romantic. The owners are very welcoming and sincere. As soon as we arrived we were served caffitiere coffee with cookies, which we enjoyed in front of the roaring fire in the lobby. The gardens are beautiful. The decor is tasteful throughout, Our room was cosy and a decent size, however the shower cubicle was too small in my opinion. It would have bee nice to have tea and coffee facilities in the room. We were very impressed by the quantity and quality of breakfast:plenty of continental options (all home-made and fresh) The berries, poached pears in vanilla syryp and granola was delicious. These are just for straters as you are then offered a cooked breakfast which, again was lovely. It was nice to have freshly squeezed orange juice as opposed to the usual concentrate which is usually served at hotels and b and b's. We made the most of the food available and could have happily not eaten again until supper time. Overall, we enjoyed our stay here. I feel that it is a little overpriced (164 euro per room for 1 night) however I do accept that Dublin is an expensive place to visit. I feel that 120 euros would have been more reasonable.",4,2011,10,17
216,Cosy stay in Dublin,"We stayed for 4 nights in September '11 and loved Number 31. The hosts and staff are very friendly, they have clean and gorgeous rooms and a great variety for breakfast. Within 10' walking you are in the very center of Dublin and the (blue) aircoach from the airport stoppes 100m away. Simply perfect!",5,2011,10,14
216,Perfect place to stay in Dublin,"My husband and I stayed at No. 31 for 4 days at the start of our honeymoon.  We loved it.  The rooms and public spaces are lovely.  Noel is gracious and knowledgable, whether it is making sight-seeing recommendations, the best route on a day-trip, or topics likely to provoke lively conversation at the the pub.  The staff were all friendly and helpful.  The location is great - easy to get around (we walked almost everywhere; otehr guests used the nearby hop-on-hop-off bus), but it was not right in the thick of the tourist cruch.  Finally, no review is complete without mentioning the justly-praised breakfasts.  All the hot breakfasts were wonderful, but it is the bread and fruit compote that put it over the top.",5,2011,10,09
216,Oasis in Dublin,"Stayed here while in Dublin for the  Mark Knoffler/Bob Dylan Concert, which was also very good.  Number 31 is an Oasis of calm in a busy city. Different but that's what makes this place so special.  Our room was in the main house, a beautiful Georgian Style, had a great night's sleep on a very comfortable bed, breakfast was the best we have ever had, beautiful fresh fruit salad, homemade bread, cranberry nut loaf to die for, such effort and nothing was too much trouble.  The reception area has a post modernist style and a turf fire, a wonderful combination.  We would highly recommend number 31, owner and staff love what they do, and it shows.",5,2011,10,07
216,"A hidden gem, cosy and informal","What a lovely place! Entering through a door in a wall in what looks like the mews/coach house of the Georgian house beyond the pretty garden, with a welcoming cup of tea and biscuits in the sunken lounge, Number 31 is definitely unique. We stayed three nights in room 20 in the Georgian house. A key to the front door of that house which is on Fitzwilliam Place made it feel like you were entering your own grand house! Room was great - in fact we had a sitting room with sofa and chair then into a spacious bedroom and modern bathroom with a walk in waterfall shower. Bed very comfy. We were lucky to have no adjoining rooms so very quiet, only a bit of traffic noise when the windows were open. If there was to be one criticism of the room, it would be the bath towels are rather on the skimpy size and given that there are no bathrobes and bigger towel would be welcome!  Breakfast is very good with hot dishes cooked to order, alongside a buffet of cereals, fruits, yoghurt. Staff very hospitable and friendly. Would highly recommend.",4,2011,10,06
216,Best breakfast in Town!,"My husband and I stayed in this unique, bijou property for three nights and were allocated a room in the Mews House overlooking the garden of their adjoining Georgian House. Our bedroom had a very comfortable large bed with good bedlinen and pillows. The decor was modernist, in line with the rest of the Mews House. We had an ensuite bathroom with toilet, basin and shower. It could do with a towel rail as there was only a hook on the bathroom door. The lighting was very subdued ; it would have been nice to have at least one bright light for putting on makeup! The windows were at floor level but this is to be expected in a mews house conversion.
Throughout the house there were spotlights on the white walls either highlighting the wall or prints of contemporary art. Tea lights were lit in the hall, reception and dining area giving a pleasant atmosphere. The sunken lounge looked interesting and inviting, especially when the fire was lit, but somehow we didn't find time to use it!
The breakfast was a revelation.  There was an excellent buffet table with cereals, fruit salad, mixed fresh berries, dried fruits etc. The foods were mainly organic which I was really happy about. My favourite was the berry selection topped with natural yoghurt. We sat at communal tables which were well set out with homemade breads, jam and marmalade. All the hot breakfasts were cooked to order. The Full Irish is a must - egg, bacon, sausage, black pudding, tomato and potato cake. Each day I chose a different dish and enjoyed the mushroom frittata and a delicious cheese omelette on our last morning.  Ample toast was brought to the table as well as the home made breads.
A particular strength of this guest house is the friendliness of the staff.  They all have welcoming smiles and put themselves out to please and to be helpful. When we were in during the afternoon we would be offered a tray of tea and cookies.  This went down well.
No. 31 is located within walking distance of St. Stephen's Green. Grafton Street, Temple Bar and Trinity College are all within easy walking distance.
If you are looking for somewhere a bit different to the usual hotel/guesthouses this is the place for you.",5,2011,09,22
216,Definitely different!,"Having come from another 'hidden Ireland' property, it wasn't quite what I was expecting! If you are looking for a comfortable base to explore Dublin from, then it ticks all the boxes. I did think it had more of a hostel feel than anything else. Our room was very comfortable so no complaints there but the lighting was so low, coupled with brown decor that it would be very difficult to read if you wanted to! It just made me want to go to sleep!
WiFi was only available after finding the owner and getting passwords & registering with a network. Tea & coffee not available in rooms and also required trying to find someone (which we couldn't)
Bathroom didnt have an extractor fan, which wasn't great if you know what I mean ;)",3,2011,09,20
216,Nice but pricey,My husband and I stayed here for two nights in May. Our room was nice but very noisy from the street below and we could hear the tv from the room next door. The breakfast was very good and the staff was helpful but we would not stay here again.,3,2011,09,12
216,Number 1,"What a little gem this place and the innkeepers are! It's perfectly located just 10 minutes (by foot) from St. Stephens Green but is sufficiently tucked away from the hubbub. 

The innkeepers are delightful and couldn't be more helpful. In advance of my trip, I emailed to ask for recommendations on a rail tour. They referred me to Mary Gibbons' Newgrange tour, which turned out to be the highlight of my vacation. Thanks to Noel (the husband of the husband/wife team), I never had even an average meal in Dublin. He made outstanding recommendations for restaurants that were nearby, long on atmosphere and easy on the wallet. 

The decor is Georgian-meets-modern and is elegant in its simplicity. 

The real star of the place, though, is breakfast. Oh, my! Fresh fruit and cereals are set out at 8 a.m., but these are but an appetizer to the cooked breakfast. You'll have a choice of the full Irish breakfast, eggs Benedict, mushroom fritatta or cheese omelet. And, there will be homemade sweet and savory breads to go along with it. Lunch will not be necessary, after indulging in the Number 31 breakfast. 

My room was on the 4th floor of a building with no elevator, which was just fine by me. (I needed the exercise after eating that breakfast.) But, if you are reluctant to climb stairs, you may want to ensure you're booked on a lower floor. 

My trip to Dublin was magical, and Number 31 is one of the top reasons why.",5,2011,09,03
216,"Very good, friendly welcome, great breakfasts.","Despite their perilous financial state, Dubliners seem intent on drinking and partying themselves out of recession and the rest of the world seems keen to join them. Hence my first ten or so choices were all fully booked and I settled for number 31 which for some reason I'd managed to overlook for many years.

This is now a very well developed and sizeable B&B, run very professionally and equally well staffed. Most of the reviews I've read here have already detailed pretty much everything so to summarise:

Good location, 5-10 mins walk from St Stephen's Green & top of Grafton Street. 2 mins from Aircoach stop, good restaurant and pubs on doorstep. Excellent welcome from owners includes briefing on Dublin, where to go & what to see. Useful if you've not been before and entertaining if you have. Cool lounge area, fire & reception. Nicely appointed, spacious but not over-indulgent room, comfy bed & decent furniture. Own key to front door, easy access at all times.

Really great breakfasts, cooked to order; eggs Benedict especially good and Irish brown bread a real treat. 

Dublin is an expensive city in many ways but €220 for the room still feels a bit steep....although when you factor in the quality and quantity of that breakfast.... maybe not such a bad deal after all. As yer man said, ""come in Paddy, come in"".",4,2011,08,23
216,What a find ...If you can find it ..,"Had a fantastic stay here for our wedding anniversary ,exactly the sort of memorable ,special place you would wish for .
The hotel is in a fantastic location ,the feel of the hotel is something very different and very cool without being pretentious in any way ,our room was very comfortable .
I have already recommended this hotel to my work colleagues,and hope i will visit again ,the staff are all very welcoming ,and Noel is such a wonderful host ,making our stay even more memorable .....I wasnt gonna leave a review ,as special places need to be kept secret ,but i felt i would be doing a disservice if i didnt post ..",5,2011,08,19
216,A special treat,Number 31 was recommended to me by an American  friend who lived in Dublin and housed all his guests there. It really was a treat. The rooms were all different and interesting. The location was great. The staff was friendly and the breakfast was amazing. This is one of those hotels where you really feel as though they have gone the extra mile.,5,2011,08,15
216,Seal of Approval- from two chefs,"My wife and I stayed two nights at Number 31 and couldn't have had a nicer time. The staff was courteous and quickly and efficiently handled any request. The property is very well maintained and traveler friendly. After our long flight from St. Louis, the owners and staff welcomed us and helped advise us on local restaurants and transportation. The breakfast offering was one of the finest we've ever experienced in many years of travel. My wife and I are both chef instructors at a culinary school and both agree that the breakfast was strictly top notch! We highly recommend Number 31 to you and send a big thanks to Noel, Linda, and staff for helping us shake off the jet lag.",5,2011,08,15
216,"Warm, welcoming, wonderful!","Noel was the quintessential Irish host. He welcomed us heartily (tea on arrival after an overnight flight, lovely touch!) and gave us a thorough overview of Dublin's highlights, with some good dining and sightseeing tips. Number 31 is conveniently located in the city (although our cab driver had not heard of it, and it was a challenge to find the ""secret"" entrance); we easily walked to shopping, restaurants and to the ""Hop On, Hop Off"" bus stop. Breakfast was great. There was plenty of room in the dining room and an outdoor sunroom to enjoy the ""Full Irish"" (and delicious fresh fruit) by ourselves, athough you can also chat with other guests. Our Superior Room was spacious and comfortable, with a big bathroom.",5,2011,08,13
216,Amazing. Will go back.,"We could only stay for one night, and we had to leave so early that we missed our breakfast. Still, we really enjoyed Number 31. The quickest and simplest reservation over the phone (Hi. Do you have a room? Here is my credit card number. Done). Both the main lounge area and our room, which was in the back through the yard, had intriguing architectural detail. Direct access from the street in the back is very convenient. Clearly much effort and thought has gone into the design and operation of this hotel. There are many hotels around the world that call themselves 'boutique' to the point where the meaning has been lost, but Number 31 is so unique that you get the sense that this is what a 'boutique' hotel really is (even if you are not into this kind of thing, you will be amazed).  Definitely worth a stay.",5,2011,07,29
216,Best Dublin secret hideaway!,"We loved Number 31.  From the minute we entered the 'secret door', to the fabulous breakfast before departing, it all worked its charm on us. The hosts were ultra charming in a very subtle way, not overbearing, just extremely pleasant.  All the staff were mature and local, which really helped set the tone of our stay.  The architectural detail of the hotel had attracted me first, but it is the finishing touches which make this place really special.  The use of colours, fabrics, textures, all help to create a relaxing and sexy atmosphere.  As this isn't a traditional walk-in 'hotel' it feels secure, personal, cosy, and safe.  Sure, there's no bar but you are in Dublin, city of bars!  In my opinion a good price for a truly excellent experience.  One we hope to repeat very soon - as soon as we can get away from our 3 kids that is!!",5,2011,07,27
216,"Wonderful atmosphere, kind and knowledgeable host","We arrived early to this B+B and were directed upstairs to have a breakfast with the other guests - we were starving and so grateful for this.  The breakfast is AMAZING.  I usually by-pass the fruits bar as it can look a little tired, but here everything is fresh and moreish.  Then Noel the owner went through a map of Dublin with us and gave us a whole itinery - this kind of personal attention was impressive and something that I just have never got when staying in a mainstream hotel.  And all the sights he highlighted were super; he even had a plan for us if it started to rain.  Our room was great; spacious and different.  My only gripe would be I'd like to be able to make tea in the room - however you can have complimentay tea/coffee and home-made biscuits over in the very cool sunken living room whenever you want.  We also were given really great champagne flutes when we came back with a bottle of champagne that we wanted to drink in the garden.  Overall, one of the most memorable places I've ever stayed - a really good example of a true Irish welcome.  Definitely coming back!",5,2011,07,25
216,"Welcoming, friendly, incredible breakfast and room",Although hard to find this hotel was well worth it. The staff were exceptionally friendly and helpful. The room was large with a very comfortable bed! Breakfast was top notch with excellent French pressed coffee. Great conversations with guests and owner. We'd go back in a heart beat! ,5,2011,07,22
216,top class hotel,"We were greeted with a heart warming welcome and the tea and cookies produced were much appreciated by these weary travellers.
The comforatable room and ambience were just the right start to our few days in Dublin.
The friendly staff went out of their way to help with any of our queries, the location is terrific and the breakfast delicious.
Number31 is one of a kind.",5,2011,07,20
216,A failure of customer service,"Having arrived here, we did not end up staying at No 31 for a variety of reasons.

They include:
1) We were initially shown a room on the 3rd floor (no lift) which was two twin beds pushed together, despite having clearly booked a queen-sized bed and not a twin as per their web-site's instructions;
2) On asking whether we could stay in a room with a proper double/queen bed we were shown to a smaller room on the 4th floor, despite my obvious difficulty with the steps to the 3rd floor; and
3) When commenting on the obvious and pervasive smell of vomit in the hallway (up the four floors of steps) the staff member showing us to our rooms responded with 'I think you're right' with no comment of how or when this would be addressed or any apology.

Being unwilling to struggle up six flights of stairs (four floors, but two were double-height) at least twice-daily through a strong stink of vomit, we decided to take our leave of Number 31.

The chief positive aspect to our experience here was that on explaining our concerns to another member of staff (perhaps more experienced, certainly better skilled at hospitality and dealing with distressed clients) we did not receive any objection or bill for leaving to another hotel.  Also, the room and bathroom were clean, albeit quite stuffy and warm (it was a fairly hot summer's day).",2,2011,07,13
216,Mostly wonderful with a few flaws,"There are a lot of great things about Number 31.  First of all, the location is perfect--convenient to just about everything.  Secondly, you could not ask for better hosts or staff.   They helped us find our way around, provided excellent recommendations, greeted us with tea and cakes (wonderful cranberry bread), provided one of the best breakfasts we had in Ireland, and generally went out of their way to be hospitable and helpful.  We loved the lobby with the sunken living room and I thoroughly enjoyed the smell of the peat fire.  We also enjoyed the general ""coolness"" of the building, which must be one of a kind!
      However: our room, while clean and comfortable, was far from perfect.   It was extremely dark, and the bathroom was even darker than the room.  Beautiful dark marble but very little lighting.   It was hard for my husband to shave and I could hardly see to put on lipstick.  The room itself was quite small and lacked counter space.  There was a mirror, but it was sitting on the floor and was therefore useless.  There was no shelf in the shower for shampoo, soap, etc, and only a tiny wastebasket for both room and bathroom.   The room looked out into the entrance courtyard and lacked privacy--and the blinds did not block the light well.  We appreciated the comfortable sofa in the room, but overall, it was not a good room for spending much time in.  So--Number 31--add some lights and some shelves and get light blocking curtains and you will be much improved!",4,2011,07,04
216,Not for the business traveller!,"Great personal service in a way you won't get in a large chain hotel, the host is v welcoming with a pot of coffee and cake on arrival. The breakfasts are absolutely amazing, no need for lunch. The bathrooms are a bit small though (we had the delux) although the bedroom was ample.",4,2011,07,03
216,Lovely chic hotel,"This littel gem in used to be the “party house” in Dublin in the 1960s. US presidents and Grace Kelly partyed under this roof.  Number 31 was originally the home of architect Sam Stephenson, a student of Frank Lloyd Wright. 

Theese days don't expect any party at Number 31. The guests are mostly middle aged and the scene is very quite. The lobby smells heavy of smoke from the fireplace, but the warm welcome and friendly atmosphere makes up for that. We were welcomed with homedmade biscuits and tea.  

The rooms are nice, though a bit dark. We had a family room and we were at bit suprised with the location in the basement with no view at all. A downer that the big rooms are not located upstairs.",4,2011,06,29
216,Gorgeous Room and Amazing Breakfast,"My boyfriend and I took a trip to Dublin for a few days and decided to stay at Number 31 based on the reviews on Trip Advisor. It did not disappoint. The couple who own the place are attentive hosts and made sure we knew where we were going and what were the best things to do in the time that we had. The breakfast was the best I have ever had at a hotel/B&B - so much food! 

We stayed in the Georgian house part, our room was lovely with a mix of old and new. The only thing that ruined it were the American couple who decided everyone needed to know they were leaving at 5.30am one morning by being as loud as possible! 

The B&B is close to the city centre and is on the route for the Air Coach so it was very handy for us. We would definitely return.",4,2011,06,29
216,Best possible hospitality,"This tiny hotel property is made up of a quirky little warren of halls, gardens, and historic Georgian houses 500 meters south of St. Stephen's Green.  The innkeeper is a marvelous host who is never without a suggestion for sightseeing, dinner, or other practicality, but for your information note that the desk is not staffed 24 hours a day (though the peat fire in the lounge burns toasty late into the night).  The staff are unstintingly generous with homemade breakfast in the sunny breakfast room.

There is no lift, but the innkeeper will gladly schlep the bags up to your room.  The halls and rooms are warmly, if simply, decorated, and this brings me to my only quibble.  The room was SMALL.  We hid the chair in the wardrobe to make more room, but there was no room for a desk or dressing table.  The bathroom was modern but had no hooks for towels or place for soap in the shower.  In short, while the hotel is loaded with charm, our room was a bit short on space and some normal embellishments.  And yes, I'd consider staying here again!",4,2011,06,28
216,WE LOVED IT,This is a hidden gem.  We arrived early in the day to a very warm welcome.  Matthew and Hannah loved their sunken bedroom.  Mine was upstairs over looking the back garden -  a very modern luxurious room.  Staff were very obliging especially the manager during our stay.   Helped with organizing a place for us to do our laundry.  A secure garage for the car and being able to leave luggage to be picked up later on day of departure were other great aspects to our stay.,5,2011,06,24
216,This place MADE my trip!,"I am loathe to write this review because if people know how wonderful this place is I'll never get a room there again!  It was my first trip to Ireland and was thinking that Dublin couldn't possibly live up to my expectations, but a local directed me to this amazing place. As an architect, I appreciated synergy of the old Georgian building and the fine modern design. The spaces are beautiful, the bed cozy and the facilities clean and first-rate. The location is fantastic, a 5 minute walk to St. Stephen's Green and the heart of old Dublin. As if this wasn't enough, the price is affordable enough that even I could stay there. I'm in love with this Number 31 and Ireland. I'll be back as soon as I can. 

I can't say enough about the friendliness of the staff who brought me tea and cookies and chatted with me on a rainy night, posted a letter out of country with their own stamps, and invited me to sit and have breakfast even after I had checked out.",5,2011,06,23
216,"Lovely Dublin B&B, welcoming host, wonderful breakfasts!","What a great way to start a tour of Ireland, once you enter the hidden door of the inn and find this peaceful little tuck away inn, you are on your way to an enjoyable experience. Host gave flawless advice on what to do, where to eat and the breakfasts are so good they are memorable to start each day. Ask for a room off the street if traffic noise bothers or bring earplugs to solve that. Lots of warm antique decor yet modern bath-perfect blend. I was traveling with my 22 yr.old son and it was a great start to the rest of our Ireland traveling.",5,2011,06,16
216,"Wonderfully hospitable, convenient and comfortable accomodations!","Our trip to Ireland was bookended by stays at Number 31. Both before our arrival and during our stay, Noel and Linda were indispensible in their touring suggestions outside of Dublin as well as arranging things we wanted to do and see while we were in Dublin. Everything was possible and doable in the most gracious and efficient way. They insured our visit was the best it could be!",4,2011,06,12
216,Great location... Easy walk to many of Dublin's top spots.,Our hosts were extremely kind and greeted us warmly.  The room was very nice... and quite comfortable.  Breakfast was excellent all three mornings.  I would stay at Number 31 again without hesitation.  Easy walk to many top sites.,5,2011,06,05
216,Irish hospitality at its best!,If you're looking for true Irish hospitality then this is the place for you.  Noel and Linda and their staff are friendly and always helpful.  Top location with everything in the GPO area of Dublin within a 5 to 15 minute walk.  Well situated to dining options as well if you prefer to eat close by.  The BEST breakfast of my four week holiday.,5,2011,05,25
216,Truly the best in Dublin,"This place is fabulous.  Noel and Diedre, the owners have put together a very hip and stylish place, that is a bit difficult to find but worth the trouble.  I would not stay anywhere else in Dublin.  While there, we met other travelers that have stayed at this place anywhere from three to seven times.  It is no wonder.  Close to everything, great breakfast, wonderful hosts and employees, eager to help you with anything at any time.  Truly the best that Dublin has to offer.",5,2011,05,21
216,"Fabulous hospitality, perfect location","A wonderful boutique hotel presided over by possibly one of the most genial and ebullient hosts ever, Noel. Your beds will be comfy, your rooms quiet, the location just off of St. Stephen's Green perfect, and breakfasts heavenly.  They will park your car as well while you're there.  Only caution is to try NOT to get the room just off the breakfast/dining room as it can be noisy first thing in the AM.  HIGHLY recommended, can't imagine staying anywhere else in Dublin.",5,2011,05,20
216,The very best Guest House in Ireland by a country mile.,Brilliant welcome by Noel who provides orientation regarding Dublin and advises places to go and Restauraunts. Rooms are lovely and the Breakfast is the best Breakfast I have ever experienced while travelling. All in all a very pleasant experience.,5,2011,05,17
216,Best Welcome to Weary Travellers,"Number31 exceeded my expectations. My husband and our 2 adult daughters arrived 8:30 AM, hours before check-in time. The owner, Noel, greeted his bedraggled guests with a welcome invitation. ""Come in and have some breakfast."" And what a breakfast it was--full Irish, or any kind of eggs you want, fresh baked breads, cereals, French press coffee...It was amazing. We stayed in the coach house which was convenient to the cozy sunken lounge with fireplace and all kind of books and brochures. Our rooms were a comfortable size with large modern baths and opening to a garden courtyard. The cleaning staff was polite and efficient. In addition to our warm welcome from Noel, we were spoiled by Linda and Delia who answered our questions and catered to our breakfast requests. We loved every second of our stay at Number31. The location is perfect. It was an easy walk to shops and restaurants and on the bus line to many places.  We would return in a heartbeat.",5,2011,05,13
216,Great experience. Great location.,"We stayed for one night. Great location to walk to all the sites of Dublin.  Breakfast was great as well. Room was nice and big, modern shower and bathroom. Our only complaint on the room was the furniture was a tad ratty with pills and such (very worn).  Be aware also the king size bed is two twins pushed together. Normally we would have minded, but we were so jet lagged it did not matter. Would for sure stay here again.  Host and staff were very nice.",4,2011,05,07
216,Not as good as expected,"Arrived to find a lorry blocking entrance way unloading fizzy pop so had to park in car park (not the hotels) opposite the hotel's nice looking door. Sadly car park full of litter and dog mess. Leeson Close a scruffy little street.

Reception area interesting; good tea and cake on arrival. Nice hosts.

Taken, through garden, to room in another building that is on Fitzwilliam Place. Room very small. So small you look around to see if there is another door to the real room. So small you wonder whether all the rooms in the hotel are this small; surely not. A glance at the fire escape plan suggests they are. Just room enough for bed with around three feet either side. Claustaphonbic Amanda said.

Bed a double made from two singles pushed together. That really irritates me. Its just so annoying. You can't get comfortable. If I'd wanted twin beds I would have asked.

Bathroom tiny. Around six foot by three foot. When sat on loo nose around eight inches from wall in front. No bath but good shower. However, in the shower there is nowhere to place soap, or shampoo or my razor. So I have to place them on the adjacent toilet seat dripping water everywhere. How complicated can it be? Maybe the hosts should try staying in one of their own rooms to see the simple things that are missing.

Room has no mirror except in the bathroom which isn't a problem for me but is, apparently, for Amanda who likes a mirror when dressing and can't use the one in the bathroom that is steamed up after her shower.

No tea and coffee in room which is annoying. Tea and coffee is available in reception but thats not helpful first thing in the morning when wanting a wake-up coffee.

Room nicely decorated albeit dark. Touch of style there but flaking paint in some places.

Fitzwilliam Place not a pretty place to stay. Woken first thing, around six thirty, by the noise from traffic below. Very noisy even on the second floor, probably because of the large sash window. View is of scruffy Georgian terraces opposite. When we stayed it was rubbish collection so from six in the evening Fitswilliam Place lined with unpretty piles of rubbish bags. Charmless.

Breakfast was ok. My partner's kippers tasted delicious. Ok but not brilliant.

Would I stay there again? No. Its in a handy location but then so are lots of hotels in Dublin; its a small city. Its certainly not worth the 140 euros I paid. The most expensive of out little four day trip and the only disappointment.

In fact, the most disappointing I've stayed in for some time. Usually trip advisor is reliable. I really cannot understand how this hotel is rated so highly.",3,2011,05,07
216,Perfect for a city getaway (and don't miss the breakfast),"My wife and I were looking for somewhere to stay within walking distance of town; it was her birthday so I wanted somewhere great but not a ""chain hotel"". Number 31 delivered completely. Perfect location, very funky place and great breakfast. We'll definitely be back.",5,2011,05,02
216,Fantastic hotel with excellent service a real home from home,"We have stayed in a number of hotels in cities around the world but this ranks as one of the most friendly and excellent in a truly unique boutique hotel. The friendly service began upon arrival with Noel providing tea and cookies for us while we got settled in. He then spent as long as we needed sharing the key delights of the city on map and sharing do's and dont's.

The family room was the best we have stayed in on the planet. Very spacious and extremely comfortable. We had two very comfortable nights and enjoyed the awesome breakfasts. The 'full Irish' is a cooked breakfast at its best - award winning and I am not surprised.

The whole family thoroughly enjoyed our stay at Number 31 and would recommend the hotel to anyone. We shall definately be back!

Thank you for a fantastic stay.",5,2011,04,17
216,Phenomonenal service and great location,Noel is a very genial host and made us feel welcome the moment we arrived. We were very tried from traveling all night from San Francisco. He immediately offered us an outstanding Irish breakfast with plenty of coffee and tea to get us going again. Once we had a brief lie-down he gave us a local map and helped us find what we wanted. Its close to all the attractions and secluded at the same time. It CAN be a challenge to find though. The reservation had good directions but it is on a VERY small street with only a small brass plaque next to a large wooden door. It doesn't look at all like a hotel. It was comfortable and quiet and we highly recommend it.,5,2011,04,07
216,Stellar,"Although a bit tricky to spot, this place is worth scouting out.  Noel, Linda and all the staff are simply the best.  They are warm, approachable, helpful and the perfect hosts.  The lobby and breakfast area (in a remodeled coach house, perhaps) are connected to the main lodging in a Georgian house by a lovely garden.  Rooms are clean and very comfortable with everything but your own coffee/tea service.  And the breakfast (especially the coffee!) is... simply sublime.  It's not inexpensive, but it's a great value for Dublin in a great location.  You won't be sorry!",5,2011,03,26
216,You won't be disappointed!,"Lovely warm welcome from Noel and lots of helpful advice on what to do and see in Dublin.  Great room, beautifully furnished and lots of attention to detail; as for those beds....they're amazing!  Wonderful breakfast, again beautifully presented.  Thank you Noel, we will be back next year!",5,2011,03,23
216,"Comfortable hotel, great breakfast, and superior service","Hotel is in a great location, just a 5 minute walk to St Stephens Green. Rooms are stylish. Breakfast was really good! Owner Noel is very kind and made us feel at home. Overall the hotel is great and I would stay there again for sure. Just one word of caution:  I would advise to not stay in Room 45 where we stayed because it is right next to the breakfast dining room and you can hear everybody talking, etc. starting around 8am..was loud especially if you were trying to sleep in late!",5,2011,03,21
216,The Only Place To Stay in Dublin,"I stayed at Number 31 for two nights. I have been traveling all around Ireland this month and I can honestly say Number 31 was the best experience I have had in terms of accommodations. Noel takes great pride in his hotel and his guests. You really do sense he cares about each and everyone who passes through the doors. The rooms were clean and beautifully decorated. The breakfasts were the best meals I have had in Ireland. Staying at Number 31 isn't just a place to sleep. It is an entire experience and key piece of Dublin's history. In case you are interested in the story behind the hotel, I wrote a review on my travel blog . 

http://suzyguese.com/the-irish-spirit-at-number-31-in-dublin/",5,2011,03,16
216,"Excellent accommodation,breakfast and really helpful hosts","This is a centrally located hotel with secure parking. Noel and Deidre are welcoming and helpful hosts. Noel talked us through Dublin when we were lost coming off the ferry! He advised us on the best way to see Dublin and told us of two good restaurants within walking distance, which as were there for only one full day meant we could get to grips with Dublin quickly.The building is beautiful and the pictures on the wbsite are accurate.We stayed in the Georgian building in a spacious elegant room with all the facilities. Breakfast is superb, we did not have room for lunch! Worth every euro.",5,2011,03,16
216,Number 31 is NUMBER ONE!!,"loved everything about it...staff went above and beyond. very warm & inviting. amazing breakfasts. down pillows & comforters. chic, cozy, highly recommend.",5,2011,03,10
216,"An excellent place to stay,incredibly warm hosts,great Irish breakfast","I had my hotel changed,after reading reviews about  Number 31,and was sure glad at my choice.I arrived early in the morning and was offered breakfast by Noel.He is a gracious host and the staff are warm and friendly.The location is central,close to St. Stephens  Greens,and  is well maintained .Despite the fact that elevators are not there,and other frills of chain hotels not there,its cosy and comfortable.The architecture,warm fire add to the charm.You feel at home here,and I would recommend it wholly as you  experience the Irish warmth.",4,2011,03,10
216,Highly recommended,"I have stayed at quite a number of Dublin hotels over the past few years, including a few in the tripadvisor ""top 20"" - I feel that my recent stay in Number 31 was the best experience out of them all. The welcome is warm and the guidance from Noel is very helpful. The rooms are modern, comfortable and well appointed. The breakfast is truly superb. I would highly recommend.",5,2011,02,21
216,A Home from Home in the Heart of Dublin,"Wonderful service, charming communal areas, and huge, comfortable rooms. 
I'm a native Dubliner - so knowing the city intimately I can confirm the area is a great one for tourists.  It's close to everything and in a safe area. The airport bus runs right outside. 

This hotel is amazing for a romantic break, with huge soft beds, spacious bathrooms and cosy corners - and a lovely courtyard garden. 

It's just a short stroll to the museums and galleries, parks, horse-drawn carriages on Stephen's Green... and right on the doorstep of plenty of excellent shops, restaurants, pubs and clubs. 

No. 31 is equally welcoming to younger guests.. my 7 year old was treated like a princess and loved her breakfast hot chocolate.   

The staff are excellent here, really treating each guest as a real person.  I felt more as if I was ""staying among friends"".

I would rate no. 31 as far superior to many of the other top-rated hotels on tripadvisor, and in terms of value for money I would rate it second to none.",5,2011,02,13
216,Totally lovely,My mom & I intended to only stay a few days and ended up staying 7. Noel is so sweet and all of the staff were completely helpful and friendly. Great location. Clean & comfortable rooms (prefer the ones in the Georgian wing). Amazing breakfast. Fully recommended.,5,2011,01,11
216,absolutely gorgeous gem,"We just returned from 2 nights at this gorgeous hotel.  We actually had 3 rooms as we were traveling with children and the family suite was booked.  I am glad because it gave us the opportunity to see more of the hotel.  We were greeted by Noel, who is a wealth of knowledge, and very helpful with suggestions about eating, tours etc.  
This was our last stay at the end of 3 weeks in England, Scotland and Ireland.  We stayed in many lovely places, but for me this was the best- the most comfortable beds, finally a decent pillow, great showers and an AMAZING breakfast.  It is about a 5 minute walk to St Stephen's green, I like the feeling of walking back to my own quiet neighborhood.  I would say that staying here is a real treat.  
I think the kids would have liked to have WIFI- which is available for a charge, but I actually was glad not to have it, and Noel let me use his computer to print off boarding passes. If I am ever back in Dublin, I will most certainly stay here.",5,2011,01,05
216,The best part of our visit to Dublin!,"Unfortunately we did not choose the best week to visit Dublin--it snowed several times, temps hovered below 0 degrees C, and many tourism sites were closed--but staying at Number 31 made up for it. Our room was spacious and quiet, the service from everyone was amazing, breakfasts were fantastic and seemed to go on forever. Noel and Deirdre are the perfect innkeepers. We definitely hope to return (in the summer next time!).",5,2011,01,01
216,Just love the place!!,"The breakfast is unbelievably good! The place is very warm and cozy, and of course, very beautiful too. For a tourist who likes to walk to all the main attractions, the location is slightly off the center, but still manageable on foot, and trading off 15 mins of extra walk each day for a place like Number 31 is definitely worth it! The ride from the airport is pretty easy (shuttle bus ride covered by the Dublin Pass). Number 31 is less than 5 min walk from where the bus drops you off. I stayed at Number 31 half a year ago but thinking back of those 3 days, it still makes me smile. I will definitely stay at Number 31 next time I’m in town.",5,2010,12,29
216,Amazing Place,"Having read many good reviews about this B & B on tripadvisor I decided  to book Number 31 for my Husband's 40th birthday surprise weekend away.
The rooms were beautiful, really big & beautifully decorated, the en-suite was again very tastefully decorated & very clean.
We arrived just before 10am and Noel gave us a complimentary breakfast which was full Irish breakfast, toast, fresh fruit and more, which was just what we needed after being up since 4am !
The location was great we didn't need to taxi anywhere, we just walked everywhere.
I would say I am quite fussy with places to stay and this place ticked all the boxes, I would definately stay there again.",5,2010,12,28
216,peaceful haven with great staff and beautiful breakfast,"Myself and my husband have now stayed twice in recent few months at Number 31 and both times we have been warmly welcomed and very well looked after indeed. We really appreciated the peace and tranquillity, the extremely comfortable beds and the delicious breakfasts, topped off by excellent and friendly service. Highly recommended.",5,2010,12,22
216,I didn't want to leave!,"I had booked my last night in Dublin at Number 31 as a splurge for myself. The reviews were good, but its hard to capture how truly wonderful this place is. 

From the moment I walked in the door, I was treated as an old friend. A tea tray in front of the fireplace, a little chat with Noel about my holiday so far: everything was so relaxed and welcoming. 

My room was in the Georgian townhouse and was absolutely stunning. I tried to pick my jaw off the floor as I was ushered into my separate sitting room and then into the bedroom. The sitting room had a full size couch with designer chair and ottoman, stained-glass window, and golden cornasing. I immediately did a lady-like belly-flop on the gorgeous bed and realized that my original plan to rush out the next morning was now completely altered. I would be sleeping in for sure. Those linens were so soft and luxurious!

I just can't say enough about Noel. He was so helpful and kind, recommended several places that turned out to be lovely. The breakfast was so different than other breakfasts I've had around Europe. Usually very few people take the chance to chat with you or get to know you. Noel facilitates such great conversations and shares such inviting stories that you can't help but be friendly. 

The food was amazing: the cheese omelette was perfectly done and the cranberry bread is seriously as good as it gets. 

It was one of the few times in my life were I was truly sad to leave a place.
I simply cannot say enough good things about this home away from home. I can't wait to go back!",5,2010,12,18
216,a safe and delightful harbour,"By the time you arrive in Ireland from North America, you need to sink into one of Number 31's beds, get up and have a great breakfast (I ate and liked oatmeal for the first time in 30 years). There are guide books to take on your wanders, but Noel is not only full of ideas, but sensitive to what you think you want. His ideas are better than yours, trust me. The team that keeps the kitchen full of great mornings is one of Ireland's great treasures, and should be models for every Irish hotel. I look forward to staying there again.",5,2010,12,12
216,Excellent with a Breakfast to die for :-),"Myself and my husband spent a weekend shopping and socialising in Dublin before christmas and the 31 was a perfect location for all our excursions.  We were given a warm welcome, the room was top class, with the offer of coffee with homemade walnut & cranberry bread or cookies really setting this place apart.  After a good night sleep, the next morning we were treated too a breakfast that was to die for. Everything you ever wanted in a breakfast was freshly available, with the Eggs Benedict being my personal favourite and my husband had a proper full irish.  Will stay again in 2011.",5,2010,12,06
216,Absolute fantastic experience - Well worth a visit.,"Stayed in No 31 a couple of weeks ago and what an experience.  I came away from my stay feeling totalling relaxed and full!!!.  The staff are brillant, friendly but also professional. The breakfast the next morning was gorgeous with a brillant choice of menu.  I could not find any fault with the place and I would definitely recommend a stay there.",5,2010,12,06
216,"Number 31- Fantastic stay, fantastic service","This year the pre Christams company tour took us, 6 couples, to Dublin where we stayed at this fantastic B&B which we saw written up and recommended in the SAS magazine this summer.And it did not disapoint us. Warm welcome by Noel, coffee while roome wer made ready, and a super breakfast. Centrally located and nice and clean. Much recommended for couples or larger groups like us.",4,2010,12,06
216,Week-en in Dublin,"We where 4 couples visiting Dublin for a week-end in the end if November. A college of me recommended this hotel and we where not disappointed. 
We are all used to staying at luxurious or business hotels, but his place is different, offering a combinations of old Irish style atmosphere with modern interior.
The breakfast is great, (be careful with the kippers if your not a fan of fish for breakfast). The atmosphere relaxing and quite.
The bed and the linings gave a welcomed rest after visiting Johnny Fox and Pearl Brasserie.
Noel, your willingness to help with practical issues are beyond expected. And thanks for redirection our Taxi to the Guinness museum.
We`l be back",4,2010,12,03
216,"Great host, Great Breakfast, Clean Room & Quiet","I find Number 31 a lovely place to stay when travelling on overnight business in Dublin. The owner, Noel, really knows how to make you feel at home and the rest of the staff are equally welcoming. I had a mushroom frittata for breakfast along with the scrumptious cranberry bread. It was the perfect start to the day. My room was clean, there was bottled water available and at night it was quiet. This is the third time I've stayed at Number 31 and the standard remains very high.",5,2010,12,03
216,So close but  unsafe & where did all that hair come from?,"Checked in late.  Artsy decor in a Georgian.  Stayed in the basement.  First room had huge window near stairs to street and no lock  and opened easily.  Clerk tried to place an umbrella between sash and frame to secure.  NO go on that.  Checked condition/cleanliness of  all 3 mattresses/box frames in same room and found copious amounts of black short hair between mattresses & box frames.  Moved to 2 other rms due to safety issue and mattresses in both other rooms were the same.  HAIRY.  VERY  Hairy.  The remainder of the room was quite clean.  It seemed as if hairbrushes were cleaned between the top & lower layers of (7) beds in the 3 rooms we sampled. I haven't seen this much hair 'cept in a barber shop. Breakfast..Superb!  Clerk had quoted a price and angry owner up'd it the next morning.  Not worth it.  No sheets, either.  Perhaps that's a regional thing.  Didn't complain about hair.. since it was in all 3 rooms we saw figured it was standard for the place.   Faucet broken.  Moved the next day to Albany House...no hair there, cleaner, safer, much nicer staff, all you can eat breakfast.  #  31 has best breakfast we had in Ireland, though.  Perhaps they would sell breakfast without selling the rooms w/ all the hair.  New name should be HAIRY NUMBER 31.",2,2010,11,30
216,"Great place to explore Dublin, amazing breakfast and great host","My husband and I stayed two nights at Number 31.   He was in County Mayo for six weeks and we had just two days in Dublin.  Arrived early and we joined the others for what must be the best breakfast in Ireland.  Great directions and guidance on what to see and do in Dublin and wonderful stories of Ireland.   Had dinner at WindingStairs, saw a play a the Gate, took the walking history tour of Dublin and wandered the streets.   We had a car and drove around a bit, trying to find the location but parking was free which was great.    Number 31 is a few blocks from Stephens Green and not directly in the center of everything, it is a lovely place to stay and we would definitely stay again.",5,2010,11,14
216,Fantastic stay in dublin,"We stayed at Number 31 for 3 nights in late September.  We were so very happy with  our stay.  Noel was so welcoming and offered many, many great recommendations for food, sights and all around touring.   Our room was immaculate and easy to manage--small by American standards, but perfect for us as we were busy experiencing Dublin.
The breakfast is amazing.  Beautifully prepared after choosing from an extensive menu as well as a lovely cold buffet with yogarts, cereals, fresh fruits and breads.  The morning staff were so nice and and provided great service, delicious food and smiling faces every morning.  They even prepared a full breakfast on our last morning when we had to leave earlier than breakfast service.  This was so thoughtful and shows the care and dedication that Number 31 offers.
Noel recommended ""Sussex"" for dinner the 1st night of our arrival, as it was 5 minutes walking distance and after a long day and flight it was the perfect  place.
We highly recommend Number 31 and hope to return to Dublin sometime soon.  We would not even consider staying anywhere else.  This place is a real find!!!!",5,2010,10,21
216,The care and consideration of the hosts was beyond compare.,"Am a bit of a traveler and have never experienced such care and attention from hosts and staff.  Wonderful touring tips, excellent breakfasts, expert knowledge of area.  Prime location and and wonderful ambience in common areas and room.  Was recovering from car crash--those Irish roads--and staff  filled my hot water bottle every night.  Stay was a real joy.",5,2010,10,18
216,Best in Dublin!,"This was our return visit to Number 31 after a wonderful 10 day stay in 2009. This occasion was a special Wedding Anniversary. We were again warmly treated by Number 31's owners, Noel & Deirdra and the entire staff. This is a very unique and special experience and should not be missed when looking for the very best accommodations and service in Dublin. We have stayed at the top hotels in Dublin, (prior to the Number 31) and would highly recommend (and do!) Number 31 to friends, and to anyone wanting a truly special Irish experience, not found in a typical chain or non-owner staffed property. Everything from the greeting on arrival to the the best breakfast in Dublin, to the tasteful hotel rooms and hotel  design, and location at St Stephens Green,  Number 31 is first class in all ways.",5,2010,10,04
216,We'll definitely return!,"We spent the first 2 nights of our 2-week Ireland trip at Number 31, and what a great way to start off our vacation! Right from the start, Noel went out of his way to accommodate our earlier-than-expected arrival. When we informed him that we would be arriving in town around 8am instead of our planned noon timeframe, he invited us to join them for breakfast, and afterwards they would see if our room would be ready for us. As luck would have it, our room was ready, and we were able to check in right away and get a much-needed nap after a long travel. Noel was also kind enough to give us a detailed map of Dublin and several recommendations on what to see and where to eat. It was a great introduction to the city!

Our entire stay was fantastic. Our room (#20) was spacious, clean, and very comfortable. Breakfast was absolutely delicious, and the entire staff was friendly and very helpful. We enjoyed our stay so much that we tried to book with them for the last 2 nights of our trip when we returned to Dublin (we hadn't made arrangements yet). Unfortunately, they were all booked up, but they went above and beyond in trying to help us find a place to stay. We were sad that we couldn't spend our last 2 nights in Ireland at Number 31, but we will definitely stay with them again the next time we visit.

Our deepest thanks to Noel and the entire Number 31 staff. We appreciate your friendliness and hospitality!",5,2010,10,03
216,"Splendid rooms, great breakfast, perfect hosts.","31 is the perfect place for access to Dublin attractions and has the benefits of a lovely setting and most of all warm, friendly, helpful hospitality.  St. Stevens Green is a short walk away where citywide transit and ""Hop on Hop off"" tourism buses stop.  There are plenty of great restaurants nearby.  Noel is the perfect host and anxious to make sure you enjoy your stay in Dublin.  Finally, breakfast is superb.",5,2010,10,03
216,Fabulous stay (again!) at Number 31 Dublin,"On the occasion of a special Wedding Anniversary we selected our return to Dublin and in particular Number 31. We were again greeted with, and experienced the same exceptional hospitality and service at this premier Hotel, as we did in 2009. This is indeed a very special experience, and a wonderful escape for anyone looking to have first rate Irish accommodations provided by a true desire by the Hotel's owner and staff to assure excellence throughout your stay. There are many choices in Dublin for lodging and we have stayed at most of the top hotels in the city.  Number 31 is simply the very best in every way, and in my opinion, the only choice in Dublin.",5,2010,09,28
216,Huge dissapointment so went elsewhere,"On the strong recommendations on Trip Advisor, we had booked our 3 night stay here a good 8 weeks beforehand and had requested a quiet room, with the least street traffic noise. We had expected to be shown to a room overlooking the garden or in the mews house. 

On arrival we were shown to a room which did not meet our request in anyway. The room also failed to meet our expectations, formed by the photographs and information on the website. The room we were shown to was a basement room facing the street, with a small light-well below the pavement. On entering the room we were hit by an overpowering damp smell. The window was barred, and although we were told it would open, it would have been extremely noisy given the traffic passing close by above us. I also found the room extremely claustrophobic and dingy. We asked to be shown to an alternative room but the young lady on reception told us that the hotel was now full and this was the room that was allocated to us, as we were the last of the guests to arrive. We were appalled by this explanation. I would expect rooms to be allocated as they are booked and not be penalised for ‘late arrival’ even though it was only around 6.30pm. If they hadn't got a garden facing room when we booked we should have been told then. We were offered an alternative room for the other 2 nights of our booking but we felt so disappointed with the allocated room that we decided to go elsewhere. We could not have slept peacefully in that room and would certainly not have been happy to pay 175euro for that night.
In their defence, the receptionist was extremely courteous and concerned and offered to find us an alternative hotel. She rang a couple and we opted for The Merrion where we got a 3nights for the price of 2 deal so the cost was not much more than Number 31 in the end. A world of difference though and we had a wonderful stay there. We had a courteous reply to our complaint email but no answers to my specific points about room allocation based on time of arrival and how they could charge a full rate for a damp dingy room in the basement.",1,2010,09,22
216,Inn-Credible! Excellent Room. Even better hosts.,Our first trip to Dublin and our first trip to Ireland. It will not be our only trip to Number 31. Everything you've read about the hosts and the rooms and the breakfasts are true. Noel and staff are extremely accommodating and told us everything we needed to know in the first 10 minutes we were there. This included a tip for a great restaurant - Canal Bank Cafe - less than a 5 minute walk away. (There's a couple of good pubs right across the street too.) Number 31 is an excellent option to a hotel.,5,2010,09,20
216,lush place to stay,"Had an amazing trip to dublin and this hotel was a great choice.
Lovely breakfast and room.... the owners couldn't have been more helpful.",4,2010,09,19
216,"Excellent small hotel/B&B; convenient, friendly.","We stayed here for a weekend visit to Dublin.  It's on an alley behind a door in a high wall, so easy to miss -- the cab driver had to hunt for it.  The facilities are beautiful and well maintained.  There's a garden for afternoon tea if you choose. The host/innkeeper is extraordinarily helpful with advice and directions (and general conversation).  Breakfasts are outstanding.  It's located one long block (less than 5 minutes) from St. Stephen's Green, with central Dublin on the other side.  Only one small demerit because, although well appointed, the room was small.",5,2010,09,16
216,"charming, up-scale boutique hotel in dublin","Stayed w/my son&grandchildren for 2 delightful days/nights in this terrific,hidden,funky hotel. Loved the decor...sort of modernist, contemporary,w/conversation pit w/lit fireplace (in July) where Noel served you tea/coffee upon arrival! Wonderful host, Noel, who enjoyed going the extra mile for his guests,from recommendations for places to see in Dublin to dining sugg in fabulous restaurants, incl.making reservations for us for a special 15th birthday dinner, all of which were within walking distance of Hotel 31. Noel even arranged for my granddaughter &me to have a VERY early, full breakfast due to an early departure from the airport and arranged for a cab to take us...a MERCEDES,no less! We'd go back in a heartbeat!! The breakfasts,aaah,wonderful,ate too much!",5,2010,08,25
216,Terrific place to stay,"Very helpful, friendly owners; great location; lovely rooms; breakfast is well worth waking up for :)  Highly recommend it.",4,2010,08,19
216,Number 31,"Wow--what a place!  Beautiful, large rooms, stunning breakfast, good location.  The best part, however, is the hospitality.  The owner, Noel, and his staff will make sure you have everything you need.  Two examples:

1). We took a red-eye to Dublin so arrived at Number 31 at 9:45 AM, planning to drop our luggage and explore Dublin until check-in time.  We were greeted with ""You're just in time for breakfast!"" and were whisked upstairs to a completely complementary and unexpected (and marvelous) breakfast.  Then our rooms were ready by 11!

2)  On our day of departure, we asked for advice on where to pick up a picnic lunch.  Instead of providing directions, Noel provided lunch!  One of his darling staff packed up brown bread with butter, lox, cheese, and cranberry bread for dessert.  

Almost everyone we met in Ireland was helpful and friendly but these folks really took it to a new level.",5,2010,08,17
216,"Great Location, Great Breakfast, Great Hospitality ...","I can't imagine having a better experience than we did at Number 31, where we stayed with our daughters, 11 and 13, in early August. The space was unique, stylish and hip, but still very classy and cozy. The rooms were impeccably clean and the linens were high quality and comfortable. The location of the the hotel is amazing -- so close to the Green and Merrion Square and there is also an off-the-beaten track area just across the canal with several good restaurants and pubs. But the best part of the stay was the personal service and attention given by the owners, Noel and Deirdre. Noel was lovely to my daughters from the start and gave us great suggestions for what to see and what to avoid as first-time visitors. The two breakfasts there were among the best two meals we had over the course of our entire vacation ... (tip: try the mushroom frittata!) When we left Dublin for our trip across the country to County Mayo, Noel insisted on packing us some brown bread and salmon for the journey and gave us another great recommendation for a pub to stop at, halfway. Thinking back, my husband and I both agree that we found a hidden gem in Dublin -- one to which we are sure to come back -- hopefully soon! Noel and Deirdre -- thank you for starting out our vacation so perfectly!",5,2010,08,16
216,Bed and breakfast with lots of personality,"Number 31 is a high quality bed and breakfast accommodation.  The owners are very friendly and helpful.  The breakfast is fantastic - home made breads and jams, wonderful Irish breakfast and other choices.  Our room, although small, was very comfortable.  Number 31 is conveniently located within walking distance of most important Dublin tourist destinations and there are many restaurants nearby.  Just one thing - you may need to walk up several flights of stairs to your room as there is no elevator.",5,2010,08,12
216,Great location in downtown Dublin; wonderful hosts!,"Number 31 is ideally located within walking distance of Grafton Street, with sights and shopping galore.  Noel and Deidre were ever helpful hosts with great advice on making the most of our time in Dublin.  The breakfast was delicious and plentiful, carrying us until dinner.  Noel made our dinner reservations at Olivier's, only a short walk from the B&B, where we had a fine meal.  Our room was spacious and clean, and because it was on the interior courtyard, very quiet for downtown Dublin.  Overall, a real treat!",5,2010,08,05
216,If I could move in I would,I had been to Dublin before but the wonderful people at 31 made for an absolute superb experience. Great care and interest in what you'd like to see and do and the design of the hotel alone is super-cool.,5,2010,08,03
216,Superb Stay,"Spent two nights at this superbly located hotel. The host Noel, was first class and we put his excellent knowledge of the area to good use. The rooms are spacious with all the mod cons you would expect. We were warmly received throughout our stay and served the best breakfast ever. This family run hotel is definantly worth a visit and comes highly recommended. We will definantly be going back.",5,2010,08,02
216,"We will never stay anywhere else in Dublin, when we return.","Make certain you book to stay in this Georgian Terrace hotel when in Dublin!  It is well situated for both business and leisure purposes.  The rooms are elegant and spacious and the breakfast second to none!  The host, Noel, a real gentleman, will ensure that you are comfortable and well-cared for. This is a unique experience and a refreshing change from the normal hotel chains.  The rates are extremely reasonable.  There are two very good restaurants a short walk down the road.",5,2010,08,01
216,No better kick off to a holiday in Ireland!,Encourtering the by now famous Number 31 welcome after a 30 hour non-stop journey from the antipodes ensured our three weeks in Ireland was going to be an outstanding adventure and experience..  Apart from the warmth and ever present sense of welcome this Georgian haven puts you right where you need to be in beautiful Dublin.   Local knowledge and invaluable advice is constantly on tap from mine host and a major confidence boost when setting off to explore all that lies outside its gracious walls.,5,2010,07,15
216,Loved it!,"We stayed in the Georgian building. The rooms were lovely, clean, and comfortable.  Noel is a charming host....we thoroughly enjoyed him.  The breakfasts were lavish and delicious.  The hotel is conveniently located....just a few minutes from St. Stephen's Green and Grafton Street.  This hotel was wonderful!!",5,2010,07,13
216,"Friendly, helpful, and delicious!","There we were, dropped off by our taxi outside Number 31, feeling (and I'm sure looking) disoriented and disheveled after the long flight from California.  Then Noel bounds out, greeting us by name, grabbing our luggage, and welcoming us inside.  We were well before check-in time, but he offered us coffee and snacks in the gorgeous courtyard while they got our rooms ready.  (Speaking of rooms, we were set for the family room, but they offered us two doubles for the same price!).  

Once we settled in, Noel gave us an overview of the city and offered suggestions for how to spend our time.  Some innkeepers can be pushy or overbearing, but Noel's suggestions were just that.  The hospitality carried over to the kitchen, as while we enjoyed some great breakfasts during our 10-day trip across Ireland, Number 31's were right up there at the top.  All in all, a perfect way to start any Ireland vacation.",5,2010,07,08
216,Gracious comfort with class in unique setting.,"The perfect find for a weary traveler.  Exquisite accomodations, personal attention to your details, and guidence in what Ireland may offer and how it best may be appreciated.  The breakfast setting, service, food and drink is incomparable and worth the stay in and of itself.  We had the privilege of Number 31's experience on the first few days and on the last day of our Ireland adventure:  The best of bookends!

216,"FABULOUS service, wonderful breakfast, good rooms ...","Just returned from a 1 week trip to Dublin for business/pleasure. Stayed at Number 31 for six nights. FABULOUS service! I travel extensively internationally and was overwhelmed by the wonderful hospitality (not overdone, very attentive). Noel and his wife were incredibly kind, gracious and helpful. I have rheumatoid arthritis and the stairs were a bit of a challenge as I was not feeling well and they were more than eager to find me a more suitable accommodation in the hotel. Stayed in the Georgian part of the hotel the first two days and in the coach house the next 4. Rooms in both buildings were good, not great - but more than adequate for the price. Very comfortable beds. Breakfast (which is included in the room price) is WONDERFUL and very substantial. Most days, did not need to eat lunch as we were still full from breakfast. In addition, tea/coffee and a small bite would be served during the day, if requested. Very good location - short walk to St. Stephen's Green/Grafton Street/etc.",4,2010,06,27
216,Didn't live up to its billing. Just OK.,"I did a lot of research before booking our hotel in Dublin -- and my decision to book at Number 31 was largely influenced by all the positive reviews on TripAdvisor (and elsewhere, such as Fodor's), talking about how Number 31 was a hidden gem, with lots of little amenities, the best breakfast in Ireland, and tucked away on a quiet street. Just to be sure we received a quiet room, which was extremely important, I specifically asked for a quiet room when I booked. However, the room we were shown to, by a very nice young man whose English was just passable, was extremely noisy, on the second floor, directly overlooking a crowded street. When we asked to change rooms, we were told that wasn't possible. 

While the room was a decent size, and although we booked a triple, my daughter was given a rollaway bed, which she said was very uncomfortable. Also the condition of the walls and ceiling were not good (scuffed and chipped). And there was zero ventilation, either in the room or in the bathroom, and we all woke up in the middle night sweating profusely, even though it wasn't 80 degrees outside (more like 60).

As for the bathroom, while it looked nice, and there was good water pressure, there was no place to hang towels or washcloths, or to place our toiletry cases, the shower had only half a glass door, so water sloshed all over the floor, conditioner and lotion were non-existent (and for the price we paid, 240 Euros a night, we expected those things), and the bathroom door squeaked terribly. 

As for the service, when you could find someone, they were very nice and helpful, though the night manager, while very kind, didn't speak English that well and had some difficulty understanding us. 

As for the breakfast, while it was very good, and it would be impossible to leave Number 31 hungry, I wouldn't call it the best in Ireland. Again, for the price we paid, we expected it to be very good, and it was. But it wasn't exceptional.

Overall, Number 31 was a disappointment, and we would not stay there again. While the location was good, and the people friendly, the noise and the price made it not a good value.",2,2010,06,23
216,A nice stay and a great breakfast!,"I stayed at Number 31 in May 2010 with three friends.  We reserved two rooms in the coach house, and we enjoyed our visit.  The rooms were fairly average, though our bathroom was really nice.  Breakfast was really great -- made to order and absolutely delicious -- and they even fed the half of our party that arrived really early in the morning on the day we checked-in.",5,2010,06,20
216,"Love the style, great host, and fab breakfast (Coach House Review)","Number 31 has two buildings:  1) The Georgian House and the 2) Coach House which used to be a stable but was converted.   I had the pleasure of staying in both.  This review is for the Coach House. 

All the rooms are unique in character.  We requested Room 13, which is the master bedroom - the architect's room.    There are no “regular” windows but an overhead skylight and lots of bright lights.     The room was very cool/retro like.  The bathroom is very unique as well - large and covered in tiles.    

 If you are debating between the two houses, make sure to read my other review on the Georgian room.   We traveled a bit in Ireland and in our second stop back to Dublin stayed at the other house! 

The host, Noel is fantastic - just the amount of attention, without being overwhelming.    The breakfast is top notch.   I looked forward to it every morning!  They also offer complimentary tea/coffee with cookies during the day.   

I enjoyed my stay here very much and would highly recommend it.  Also, the location is in the midst of the Georgian historic area, so you're in a residential neighborhood vs. touristy area, but within a few minutes walk to the tourist stuff.  Good location.   

Tip 1:  If you stay in the coach be advised that it’s the “main house” which means that the main lobby/living room and dining area is there.   Noise wasn’t an issue, because I was exhausted every night but I thought I would mention it. 
 
Tip 2:  All the rooms are unique, but if you are a light sleeper, I would advise not getting the room that is right next to the dining room.  We were eating breakfast there and then suddenly a guy gets out of his room in his slippers!   
Noel is a great host.",4,2010,06,20
216,Marvellous stay,Great breakfasts; beautiful rooms; proprietors beyond hospitable; excellent central location.,5,2010,06,20
216,lovely spot in center of Dublin,Spent four nights here during visit to Ireland. The place is charming. Each room is unique and the breakfasts are impossible to beat. The host Noel really makes you feel at home. He is extremely helpful in planing excursions around the city and his insight on what to see and do is remarkable. We selected it initially because it had free parking when we arrived in Dublin at the start of our vacation. When we were coming back into Dublin we went out of our way to stay there again before our flight home. All in all - one of the best places we stayed in during our trip.,5,2010,05,14
216,"Beautiful Hotel, Brilliant Breakfast!","My husband and I spent our wedding night at Number 31, in one of the Double Superior rooms. It was a beautiful room, with an unusual ""shrink-wrapped"" chandelier and lots of smart furniture - it was more like a living room with a bed than anything I've been in before, and was perfect. The bed was very, very comfortable, and we heard no noise from outside, meaning we had a great night's sleep (something we were grateful for after a busy wedding day!). The bathroom was very stylish with nice toiletries and one of the best showers I have ever used...I could have stayed in it all morning!

The breakfast, as others have said, was amazing. Served in a lovely bright room on smart crockery, there was huge choice and all of it was delicious. Noel, the charming, very friendly owner, came out to greet us while we were breakfasting and made us feel very welcome. All in all, an excellent experience, and I would recommend this hotel highly.",5,2010,05,11
216,Very lovely place to stay!,"My husband and I stayed at the Number 31 for 5 days.  It was one of the most friendly and hospitable places we have ever stayed. Noel, Dierdre and their staff really know how to take care of their guests - from how welcome we felt the moment we walked into the door, to helping us with any requests we had, all the way until we checked out.
The breakfast is really wonderful too - everything is so fresh and tastes that way.  They were kind enough to accommodate our vegetarian requests too (try the cheese omelette - yum!).
The location was about a 5-7 minute walk to St. Stephens Green, so you were in the middle of town in no time.
We stayed in the Georgian House.  The room itself was very large and nicely furnished with a good balance of modern and traditional style.  Our room had very high ceilings and ornate decorations on it - the original work of the building.  The Hästens beds are extremely comfortable.   The bathrooms were a good size and modern as well.  Most of all, the room was very clean and well taken care of.  
Should we return to Dublin, we would certainly stay here again.",5,2010,05,08
216,Great hotel with fantastic service,"Our first visit to Dublin and we chose this hotel because of the great reviews on Trip Advisor.  We were not disappointed - the rooms were spacious and well appointed with a trendy mix of period detail and modern fittings.  The breakfasts were every bit as good as advertised - great variety and excellent quality, all served with a friendly face - we felt incredibly welcome.
We had the misfortune to have flights booked for the day the volcano debacle erupted....the hotel were utterly fabulous - they gave us access to their PC so we could book the ferry and they did everything possible to keep us in our rooms for the extra 2 nights, they even served us breakfast early on our day of departure - we could not imagine a better hotel to be stranded in!  We did not get to meet Noel as he was stuck in Portugal but the rest of the team did him proud and we look forward to a return visit!",5,2010,04,26

216,Don't Miss The Opportunity To Stay Here,"This place is uniquely beautiful. Everything from initial phone contact to leaving was excellent. The room was extremely spacious, comfortable, quiet, very clean with lovely designer furniture. The beds provide a heavenly sleep. Public areas are spacious and interesting - a great place for a family or group who would like to hang out.
Breakfast was divine with lovely ingredients and served with pride.
Noel & Deirdre are lovely people who's only interest is YOU.
Great value too. I'll be staying here again.",5,2010,04,01

Breakfast is delicious and the staff were attentive to all of our requests.  Our rooms were cozy and well-appointed.  Although not in the middle of the city, it's an easy 5-10 minute walk to St. Stephen's Green and everything beyond that we wanted to see and do.  I would definitely return!",5,2010,02,15
216,Wonderful experience.,"I was travelling to Dublin with my wife and three month old son for a couple of days and decided to book Number 31 largely based on reviews from TA. First of all the booking experience was very pleasant and efficient - within a couple of quickly responded to emails, we were booked and had lined up a baby cot and a potential child minder for one of the nights out. Upon arrival we were greeted with a lovely cup of tea and then taken to our room. We arrived earlier than the normal check in time, but that was not a problem. The room itself was beautifully decorated, with stylish furniture worthy of any top class boutique hotel. We were situated in the Georgian house and the room was very much in keeping with the period, with modern touches thrown in. Most importantly, the baby cot was in place and the room was cozy so Kian was sound asleep within minutes of laying him down after a short flight.

We met Noel a short while after and his advice to visit some of the local establishments was well considered. The short walk to O'Brien's around the corner for a pint of the black stuff was well worth it and we were to discover a few days later that the restaurant upstairs (Oliviers) is also a gem worth knowing about.

The hotel itself is well situated and really only a short walk to the main shopping and sightseeing areas. 15 mins brisk walk to Grafton Street no more.

Breakfast definitely lived up to expectations with the obligatory Irish on the first days and kippers on the second day going down very well, alongside fresh fruit and yoghurt. The courteous staff could not do more to help us, especially as Kian was in a bit of a mood and wasn't afraid to let everyone know!

We all really enjoyed the trip and the stay at Number 31 was most relaxing. We didn't get as many sightseeing things done as we had hoped and this was due to the fact that we kept heading back to the room for a snooze and failing to wake up to do anything else. This says much about the homeliness of the place - would definitely recommend it!",5,2010,01,24
216,What a treat!,"We are in the hotel business ourselves and had to stay in Dublin for the weekend with the kids. My sister in law recommended this hotel as she stayed in it before Xmas so we tried it out. What a fabulous place, lovely room with the best bed i have ever slept in, brilliant breakfast with beautiful fresh fruit and bacon and eggs cooked the way you want it. The attention to detail in the design is amazing with a lot of beautiful and expensive pieces.  And then there is the staff and Noel who makes you feel so welcome and part of the family. We definitely will be back and would highly recommend this hotel to anybody.",5,2010,01,22
216,When can I come back?,"A friend and I stayed for 2 nights in nov. 09. I know where to stay next time in Ireland!

216,My All-Time Favorite Hotel,"My husband and I stayed at this hotel during my spring break (I'm a grad student). We saved up for 5 years for this trip to Ireland, so we decided to splurge a little bit on the hotel in Dublin because we wanted a really comfortable place to stay that was convenient to everything we wanted to do, but also had breakfast included in the price. We absolutely loved our accommodations and were sad that we could only afford to stay 2 nights.

Before we really figured out the layout of Dublin, on the first day, we walked in directions that weren't really helpful to anything. However, once we got our bearings, we discovered Hotel 31 is about a 10 minute walk from most of the main districts, and maybe a 20-30 minute walk from Temple Bar. We were loathe to drive in Dublin, we only rented a car for when we went to Limerick after our 2 day stay--so we didn't mind the walking (not even at night). Even in March, and even though we're from Los Angeles, as long as you have a coat, we found it was warm enough and we always felt safe.

The room we stayed in was small, purple, and even though it was kind of sparsely decorated/furnished, it had a really plush and romantic vibe to it. The bathroom was updated with new fixtures and rain showerhead, and it seemed like a fine size to me (I'm 5'4"") but my husband (6'2"") found it a little small. That's not to suggest the sink and showerhead were oddly low or anything, it's more like, the space in the bathroom felt cramped to him.

A full Irish breakfast is built into the price of the room, and it is, by far, one of the best meals I've ever had (even in restaurant). The Eggs Benedict are amazing at Number 31. Also, the proprietors are so lovely and warm and friendly. The hotel is exceptionally quiet and I found it very beautiful in a retro shabby chic kind of way. The fireplace/pit when you first enter the establishment seems kind of odd at first, but it's really cozy and kind of beautiful. The courtyard we had to walk through to get our room, even though it was outside, didn't bother me at all because it was so lush and green.

There is also free parking. And free internet as well (since this stay at Number 31, I have traveled a lot for conferences and I will never take for granted reliable, free high speed internet again, most places charge, and if they don't, the internet service is spotty at best).

This is honestly one of my favorite hotels (the only competition being the Mercer Hall Inn in Stratford, Canada).",5,2009,12,09
216,"Beautifully designed, comfortable space with excellent hospitality.","Enormous Georgian rooms with some original detailing contrasted with modern accessories and palette, a beautiful space with extremely comfortable beds. We have stayed at this lovely hotel at least 4 times. Location is superb as we frequently would walk to Grafton Street or Camden Street. The bus, a great way to get around Dublin stops near by. The hospitality is above reproach, including the time we showed up exhausted with a rental car which Noel, ever the charming host, parked for us. Breakfasts are delicious, there was something for everyone, which makes traveling with extended family so pleasant.",5,2009,11,30
216,A hidden gem!,"Most welcoming and friendly staff  - I was greeted with coffee and cake infront of the open fire - wonderful welcome on a cold, wet and blustery November day!
My room was fine, however would recommend a quick check of the bathroom prior to unpacking.  I stayed in Room 10 in the Mews (previous stays have been in the Georgian part of the buidling) - the bathroom had a slight, blocked drain smell; as I always travel with smellie candles in my case, not too much of a problem for me.  However, if I had discovered this smell before unpacking, would have checked if an alternative room could be offered.  Breakfast is good, with little differences such as stewed rhubarb and strawberries with a hint of cinnamon. Little 'extras' with my poached eggs such as homemade potatoe cake and grilled tomatoe make the difference.  And last but not least, the cranberry bread is delightful with a pot of tea - I will be returning to this little gem!",4,2009,11,05
216,A gem of a guesthouse!,"Just spent 3 nights at Number 31.  The hospitality of owner, Noel, and his staff is second to none.  Nothing is too difficult to handle.  From the moment you walk into Number 31, you feel like you are staying with old friends.   Breakfast is included in the price with made to order eggs, fruit, cereals and fresh baked breads.  The sauce on the Eggs Benedict is incredible!   If you like oatmeal, just ask and you get the fluffiest, creamiest oat meal this side of the Atlantic...add some of the strawberry and rhubarb compote and you start the day in pure heaven!   

The rooms (small in typical Euro fashion) are spotless and you will love the feather pillows, good linens and pillow top feather mattresses. Our bathroom had Molton Brown products!!!  This place exudes charm.  Price was moderate for the location.   Number 31 is walkable to all major Dublin sites, but is located in a very Georgian style, quiet neighborhood.  

One caveat:  ask for a lower floor room.  There is no elevator and the stairs are a killer with heavy luggage.  All in all thanks to Noel and his staff for making our first trip to Dublin a true pleasure!",5,2009,10,19
216,A wonderful hidden gem!,"We just returned from a 10 day trip to Ireland and our last days were spent in Dublin.  Number 31, and Noel is just an excellent choice of where to stay in Dublin.  If you're looking for something special - this is it!  The location is fabulous - able to walk everywhere.  Noel is so gracious and tends to every need.  The property is truly a hidden gem, tucked on a little side street.  The entire property is immaculate, beautifully decorated and appointed.  Breakfasts are a special treat.  We will definitely return and recommend this property to anyone.

216,MIxed feelings,"This is a rather hard review to write. I had high expectations from all the accolades posted on TA.  After a delayed fight from the US into Dublin we arrived at No. 31 in the early afternoon.  We were greeted very warmly by Noel, given tea and cake, and a brief rundown on dining  and sightseeing options.  Our room was number 21 in the big house.  It was spacious with comfortable seating and bottled water was available.  The bath was very compact with an excellent shower, however the lighting is very ""atmospheric"".  A bit too dim for my taste!  I agree with a previous poster that the baths are not designed for female travelers. The beds were very comfortable.  Our biggest concern was the amount of noise coming from the street outside.  Traffic, both people and cars, went on all night.  If we stayed again, we would ask for a room in the coach house.  Breakfast was very good and the wait staff were helpful.
Overall, Number 31 is a beautiful location, the garden between the buildings is just lovely, and we would stay again if we could have a room away from the busy street.",4,2009,10,13
216,good but not great,"Hhmmm, difficult one this.  I chose it for a number of reasons - award-winning breakfast, unique hotel rather than a chain, beautifully appointed Georgian house, location, value for money etc.  I was OVERLY excited about the breakfast, but more of that in a minute.

Good location, beautiful building, excellent hosts (almost felt like I was a guest in their home and they couldn't do enough to help) and vaule for money was ok in comparision to every other option in the horribly overpriced Dublin.  However...

I had enquired about a twin room that I wanted to share with my American cousin.  She's always banging on about space, so I asked what the twin rooms were like.  I was told that I could opt for a superior twin room which would afford us more space than the standard (at a higher cost).  I took the superior.  I was more than a little gobsmacked to discover that the additional space came from the fact that the 'superior' room only had what seemd to be record-breakingly small single beds.  No joke, I barely slept as I felt I was about to tumble out.  This was SUCH a let down.  The room itself was actually really nice.  Bathroom was a curious mixture of sturdy, classy and modern three piece suite (well, no bath but a great shower), together with cheap, nasty, flimsy accompaniments.  Odd.

The setting is wonderful and location excellent.  A lovely garden segues from one part of the building to the other.  The buildings are stunning.

As odd as it may seem, the final deciding factor for me choosing Number 31 was the reviews about the breakfasts.  What an utter, utter disappointment.  I'm not a cereal person and nor do I particularly like fruit first thing in the morning.  I was pinning my hopes completely on the wonderful hot, made-to-order breakfast.  A big fat bland plate of fried food is what I got (apart from mushrooms - where were the 'shrooms??!!!).  Actually, that's not strictly true as it wasn't even big.  Within an hour and a half we were sitting down to brunch elsewhere in the city.  Really over-rated.

Yes, it's nice, especially as it's not a chain, but it's not exceptional.  I think as per other reviews on this site, it's ok but just don't raise your expectations.

Shame.",3,2009,10,06
216,Worth Going to Dublin to stay at Number 31!,"I realize that all the reveiws here are highly subjective, but I cannot for the life of me understand HOW people gave Number 31 anything lower than 4 stars here!  There may have been rocky road when it began-- but as far as I could see, all of these issues have long since been resolved.  

My stay at Number 31 was nothing short of fabulous, starting from my request for a great room with a lot of light, to my farewell with Noel, the owner.

Our room was #41 on the top floor of the main building, so a four story walk upstairs.  It is a nice room with small entry and new bathroom with shower.  The building is carpeted throughout, a beautiful Georgian remodel.  Some period features, such as the staircase and tile entry floors, remain.  Staying here is like staying in someone's home.

The breakfast, as written about extensively, was great.  The service fantastic at breakfast, and really, I can't think of a single bad thing to say (nor would I want to!) about Number 31.  Noel, the owner, has a fantastic sense of humor, a wonderful disposition, and is very helpful.

This is not a hotel, but it isn't really a bed and breakfast either.  I'm not sure how they classify it, but with the prices in Dublin as high as they are, this place is CLEAN, MODERN, WARM, NICE, GREAT VALUE.  I am trying to convince my husband to return so we can stay in Room 20.  A nice suite.  Beautiful.  If you want a special time away with someone, try to get into this room!!

Oh, the only possible downsides are that internet is not included in the room and it's a 10-15 minute walk from Grafton street, but there are tons of buses which go to O'Connell / Grafton street area, and the walk through St. Stephen's Green is beautiful, relaxing, and nice, so we didn't mind it.

If you have mobility problems, this may not be the place for you, but have a chat with the owners to see what arrangements they have made for people with mobility problems in the past.  They are so amenable, I bet they'd do everything in their power to work something out.",5,2009,10,05
216,Excellent again,"This is the second time we have stayed here, this year! We planned a trip to Wicklow, but we loved 31 so much the first time, we spent our first night at Number 31 again. I feel like Noel is part of the family now, he's such a fantastic host, this time I met his wife too, who cooked us the most perfect breakfast. I only eat fruit and there is the best selection I've ever had in Ireland.My family ate everything, Irish breakfst, toast, fruit, cereal. I'll never stay in a chain again when there are places like this giving such great service. We had dinner at Harry's this time, it's a great restaurant. I wanted to find the Apple shop, I sort of mentioned it and Noel was straight on the computer googling for me. Nothing seems too much. Thank you Noel and I hope your leg is getting better.
It's in the heart of Dublin near St Stephen's Green yet I couldn't hear any traffic or Saturday night street noise.
This time we had a hire car and there is parking.If you don't want to hire a car it's a very reasonable cab fare from dublin airport and if your staying in Dublin , you don't need a car.
I can't think of anything, that they haven't thought about. Great place, actually it was reviewed in the national Newspaper the weekend we were there and it was at the top of the reviews for this catagory of accomodation",5,2009,09,30
216,A TRULY UNIQUE HOTEL and UNFORGETTABLE EXPERIENCE,"We spent 2 nights at Number 31 and wished it was more.  From the moment of our arrival, Noel and his staff set the tone of the hotel - friendly, informed, competent, superior service.  Our room (#11) was the perfect size for us, offering a spotless, modern washroom and charming outdoor patio off a sitting area. The beds are the most comfortable in Ireland!! The gourmet breakfasts are famous, as is attested to by the fact that friends of ours staying in Dublin ""elsewhere"" heard of the breakfasts at Number 31.  The lounge (or ""pit"" as we nicknamed it) acts as like a magnet for guests.  Before you know it you are involved in conversations with other travellers from all over the globe.
And then there is Noel!  He is keenly intelligent and exceptionally well-informed about the current politics of his beautiful country and about its history.  Passionate about Ireland is a more fitting description. All the reading we did about Ireland before our visit did not teach us as much as we learned from Noel in two short days.",5,2009,09,28
216,Above & Beyond!!,"We are a very well travelled couple & Number 31 has to be the best place we have ever
stayed. The entire staff were always corteous & so helpful. Noel was the perfect host,
gave us a fantastic orientation on arrival telling us what to do while we were in Dublin.
Number 31 is the perfect location within walking distance to the majority of all the major
attratctions. Our room was absolutely beautiful, the most comfortable beds we have ever
slept in but to top it all off was the breakfast - never seen anything like the spread they
put on, from fresh homemade breads, fresh fruit & berries with yogurt to the choice of
cooked breakfasts. We had the full Irish breakfast & smoked salmon with scrambled eggs, there was additional choices but we were not there long enough to go through them all - wish we were!! I have to say all of the food was exquisite!! We so looked forward going to breakfast each morning. We will definitely be back!!  Thanks to all at Number 31 for making our stay such a memorable one!!",5,2009,09,08
216,"great room, great service and U2","We went to Dublin for U2 concert and found a great hotel. 
We will definetly go back.  Noel and his family made the stay great.  They are so freindly and helpful. Noel is the perfect Irish gentlemen.   Made us feel like family.   Rooms are large with fireplaces.  Very modern bathroom.  But the number one thing about his hotel is the full Irish breakfast.  I still can't forget it, the toast was from heaven.  
Great area, close by  everything.  Meet nice people at breakfast.  Thank you again Noel.",5,2009,09,08
216,Mixed feelings....,"I had high hopes for Number 31 based on its rating and the reviews on TripAdvisor, but aside from the marvelous breakfasts (which are indeed everything everyone says they are, and more) I was overall disappointed with our stay - not terribly so, and there was nothing horribly wrong, it just wasn't what I expected for the $$$ and I would choose to stay elsewhere on a return trip (we spent 3 nights at Number 31, and 3 at another hotel, and I much preferred the other hotel for our style of travel).  

Our room at Number 31 was very small, it was quite warm in the room at night and the only way to attempt to cool it down was to open the (single pane) window, which  was directly on busy Fitzpatrick Avenue.  Needless to say we didn't enjoy luxurious slumber while at Number 31, although the beds, pillows and linens were remarkably comfy.  They charge 13 euro for 24 hours of internet usage - an increasingly annoying practice when so many hotels offer wi-fi in your room for free.  The bathroom was tiny, and hard to negotiate.  They do have a blowdryer, which is nice, and although there was a full length mirror there wasn't a plug nearby for the blowdryer (and like England, there aren't plugs in the bathrooms for the blowdryers) - let's just say it felt like the bathroom/dressing area was not designed with the female traveler in mind!  The design of the inn is lovely - the paint colors, the public reading nooks, the chairs and other furnishings.  All quite aesthetically beautiful.   And kudos to the housekeeping staff - they do a marvelous job and leave lovely tealights burning in the hallways in the morning.

The location was a bit out of the way for us.  While we didn't want to be in the heart of Temple Bar, we enjoyed our later location above the Liffey much more for our style of travel.

So I suppose it all depends what you're looking for.  If an excellent, inclusive breakfast is important to you, this is the place.  If other aspects of your stay weigh more heavily, know what you want and do your homework.",3,2009,09,02
216,Beautiful Place!,My wife and I recently took a break and traveled up from Galway for a short stay in Number 31. From the moment we arrived we were made to feel very welcome. We loved the stylish design of the place particularly as the owners have managed to retain a very welcoming homey feel to the place. The bed was extra comfy and the rooms really quite even though it's positioned right in the city centre. Breakfast was superb with a buffet of fresh fruit and cereals followed by a cooked breakfast of your choice from the breakfast menu - we loved it and we'll be back as soon as we can!,5,2009,08,25
216,Many Things to Like--but keep your expectations in check,"This is a difficult review to write because there really are so many things to like about Number 31, but there are some inconsistencies which for the luxury level price point (199 Euro/night for two) do not meet the mark.  And the hype surrounding this property means that expectations are high.  To be fair, the price point does drop if you stay 3 or more nights when the deal includes a free night.

The three most valued parts of the experience are the staff including the oft-mentioned Noel Comer, the owner, the quality of the beds with extremely comfortable (high quality) mattresses, and the breakfasts which are exquisite with home made everything including compotes and jams; the quality of all the food and the tea/coffee is of a very high standard.  They were a wonderful way to start the day with enough variety for those staying several days.

Rooms are spacious and nicely outfitted, but the bathrooms are very dimly lit, which makes applying make up and shaving difficult.  The plumbing is in need of an update; the shower dripped continuously, and the toilet handles are iffy.  Although there are complimentary toiletries, the sizes are small and not replenished frequently enough for longer term stays.  Some of the bathrooms had ventilating fans that worked, and some of the others didn't, which can steam up things considerably.  Internet service is not complimentary but can be purchased in minutes from the front desk.  Our television set only got 3 grainy channels.  In sum, the rooms and bathrooms can be beautiful to look at, but the devil is in the details.

The location is about a 15 minute walk to the city centre, and there is an Air Coach stop on the same street as the hotel.  You can request complimentary tea or coffee at any point during the day, and they'll serve it to you in the lounge.  We found the hotel quiet and are very glad that we stayed here because we did want to see what everyone was talking about.  I am just not sure I would stay here again mainly due to price.",4,2009,08,04
216,"Wonderful hosts, breakfast and room","Noel was such a wonderful host; he made both my friend and I feel welcomed and at home at once. The entire staff was always courteous and helpful. What I really liked was they seemed to love the hotel and Dublin which made me more excited to see what this great city had to offer. It was the nicest/most expensive place we stayed while in Ireland, but it was worth every cent. And the breakfast was remarkable.",5,2009,07,28
216,A Wonderful Welcome,"We stayed at Number 31 based on Traveler Advisor recs. I was not dissappointed. We arrived weary from a long trip from the West coast of the states. Neal greeted us and offered coffiee and cookies, while our room was readied. We were accidentally put in a room w/one bed. (needed 2) and when I mentioned this Neal immediately took us to a different and bigger room for the same rate. As all have said the breakfast is incredible though too much for me so I didn't take advantage of it. In all a terrific spot, especially as a first hotel after arrival from the states.",5,2009,07,19
216,First Class Service On A First Name Basis,"Noel and his staff are warm, professional and gracious.  The location is great, the facilities are beautiful and tidy and the breakfast is top notch!!.",5,2009,07,11
216,A top notch place to stay,"We stayed for two nights in a room in the Georgian house (Rm #20); the bed and room are top notch and perfect for an good night’s sleep.  The breakfast is delicious and more than satisfies you for a day's adventure in the city.  The staff is terrific; they provided what turned out to be wonderful touring and shopping suggestions and restaurant reviews and recommendations. Special kudos Breta (Rita with a B - spelling?)  She helped us with the electricity and a shopping recommendation that saved us plenty.   The lovely courtyard is quaint, but not perfect for a glass of wine and cheese - a bench would be best, but it's lovely and we enjoyed the privacy and tranqility.  The proprietors (Noel and Deirdre) are accommodating, accessible, and provide a warm atmosphere for a holiday.",5,2009,07,11
216,Booked friends into this B&B and one a wonderful reputation!,"I booked friends into Number 31 and we were all well pleased. The breakfasts were great (and sizable!) as well the customer service for my part. When my friends had to leave before breakfast, one of the folks there got up early to make sure they had some sustenance pre-airport! We were all very pleased :)",4,2009,07,07
216,"Great location, geat host, fantastic breakfast","We were 9 middle-aged ladies on a short English language study trip to Dublin and stayed at Number 31. The rooms are beautiful, in a modern design with warm colours and have everything you need to relax from wandering the streets. Noel, our host, was extremely helpful and nice and made us feel at home. The breakfast was outstanding and we were able to sit all together at the long wooden tables and start our day in a slow and easy way.
We also liked the ideal location of Number 31 as it's not too close to the busy and noisy city centre; but everything we wanted to get to (as concerts, shopping, museums, restaurants etc.) was within walking distance, i.e. 10-15 minutes.
Just one little thing on the negative side: please let us have our hairdryer next to the mirror in the bathroom. It's not very comfortable to sit cross-legged on the bedroom floor while styling your hair... or maybe I'm just too old for that??",4,2009,07,04
216,Dublin's Perfect Hideaway,"Arrived 615AM after the flight from Boston. Made it to the hotel and we were greeted warmly. We expected the usual ""your room will be ready by 3, but were surprised when were were told, here is some tea and breakfast will be served shortly. An hour later we were eating breakfast in the fabulous sunroom. Right after that, Noel took us to our room and we were in by 10AM. The room was beautiful and clean. We chose the older historic section of the complex. We took a nap and headed out. The location was the perfect location for Dublin. You can, and we did walk everywhere, plus public transportation is nearby. Bus stop to the airport is 2 blocks away. Breakfasts were fabulous and our hosts could not be nicer. When we return to Dublin this will be our spot. We only stay in bed and breakfast locations when we travel and this one is a place you would return to.  It is pricey but well worth it.",5,2009,06,21
216,Hidden Gem,"Wrote this email to Number 31 after our stay there.
Dear Noel, Linda & Delia,
My wife Ellie and I want to extend our appreciation to you all and your staff for a very nice stay at Number 31 for this past week. We had a very nice visit to Dublin which was further enhanced by you folks and your graciousness to all your guests. And, of course we cannot say enough about the daily breakfasts. In a word, they were fabulous. We have an extended family here in the USA(our sons, numerous nephews and nieces) and if any of them have a future desire to visit Ireland, we will heartily recommend Number 31 to them.
Again, thanks for making our stay in Dublin a happy success. Good luck and good health to you all.
Sincerely,
Leon Dourgarian",5,2009,06,12
216,Lovely!,"I stayed here for the final leg of my English/Irish adventure, and it was a lovely place. For the most part, the service was amazing. I had a large suitcase and I felt terrible because poor Gareth wouldn't hear of me carrying it up the four flights of stairs myself. I appreciated him all the more when it was time to check out and I had to luge it (and the extra duffel I'd acquired) down those stairs on my own! I had to call the front desk a couple of times for information, and I definitely detected exasperation in the voice of the woman who took my calls. I found that off-putting; I was asking general questions about Dublin, and couldn't see what was so obnoxious about them. The full breakfast offered was amazing, the anticipation of which got me up earlier than I might have done otherwise. The seating at breakfast encouraged conversation with my fellow travelers, and I met several very nice people this way. 
The room itself wasn't large, but I was on my own, so it didn't matter. The shower had excellent water pressure but was teeny. The bed was simply divine though. After all the walking I'd done on my trip, it was nice to lay on such a comfortable bed!
The wireless policy was a bit baffling, as it's free but still meted out in increments. My stay was for three days but I was allotted two days of wireless. When, on the third day, I needed to arrange transport to the airport from the hotel, I was reluctantly given another 45 minutes. Truly bizarre.
Still, a cool place to stay in a pretty section of Dublin. If you take a taxi there, make sure they know how to find it (the property also borders Fitzwilliam Street).",4,2009,06,08
216,Extremely Hospitable,"When we first arrived (around 10 am- after a long sleepless flight) we expected to just be able to drop our bags off and then walk around the city for a few hours until we could check in. They promptly served us wonderful french-pressed coffee with biscotti-like cookies that really hit the spot. They then ushered us to our room! Noel is a genuine host- offering directions, special accomodations, etc...  
The breakfast was fantastic (bananas in sweet cream were my favorite!) and both days we didn't eat again until 4 in the afternoon- it really kept us going.  
We came back again for a third night at the end of our Ireland trip- Noel, once again was most accomodating- our flight was early the next day so we had to leave before breakfast hours- his staff generously fixed us a quick scrambled egg and whatever cereals and fruits that we liked.  The rooms were clean and modernly decorated - my only complaint was that it was difficult to shower without getting water everywhere because the stalls weren't completely  enclosed by design (but that seems silly in the overall scheme of things).  I think that we would have liked to be slightly closer to Grafton street since that was were all of the action was but the extra few blocks of walking was good for our waistelines :)",5,2009,05,31
216,No 31 The Best Place to stay in Dublin,"My husband and I stayed at No 31 in January and had the very best weekend. This was in no small way due to staying at No 31. All the staff were charming, nothing was too much trouble and the breakfasts were amazing. The owner Noel was very hospitable, his knowledge and passion about Dublin was infectious. A very unique place to stay, we will be back.",5,2009,05,24
216,Absolutely gorgeous,"We spent one night here and it was absolutely fabulous. Lovely friendly owner and staff, they were really welcoming and helpful. Beautiful setting and a great location - it was in walking distance to all major attractions. We couldn't fault it at all and would definately go back. It's not the cheapest place you could stay in but I felt that we really got value for money, we arrived at 9am on the Saturday morning, were given breakfast and allowed into our room straight away, this was great after an early flight. The room and building were lovely. The owner advised us what to do that day and suggested a great place to eat that night which was just round the corner. It was so easy and totally hassle-free. We loved it!",5,2009,05,20
216,Surely the best place to stay in Dublin!,"I have recently returned from a weekend break in Dublin, staying at the amazing Number 31.  Noel (the owner)was the perfect host, helping us navigate a city we hadn't been to before.  He made us feel right at home from the moment we arrived, bringing us tea and homemade cookies whilst we discussed what we would like to do and see in Dublin. The hotel is beautifully decorated with large airey rooms, relaxing public areas and the best Irish breakfast!  We left Noel in charge of booking us somewhere for dinner on Saturday night which was a triumph.  The restaurant was just what we wanted and a wonderful place to enjoy the evening (The Pearl Brasserie).
Staing at Number 31 was probably the best part of our trip to Dublin and i would recommend it to anyone that is planning a trip there.
Lastly, i would like to thank Noel for his brilliant Irish hospitality and for making our trip everything we had hoped it would be.",5,2009,05,11
216,Wow! Everything you expect AND MORE!,"I have just returned from spending the weekend here and I really cannot praise it enough! Five of us spent 2 nights here for a girley weekend away and from the moment that we arrived we couldn't have been made more welcome.
Noel greeted us in true Irish style, friendly and warm. Tea and home baked cookies, followed by a great introduction to Dublin with tips on what to do! The rooms were fantastic, clean, good sizes and cosy with great beds! The whole house had a modern yet homely feel in a stunning building. 
The breakfasts were out of this world, Noel and Deirdre could not do enough for you and were happy for you to sit and chat in a relaxed atmosphere, without feeling rushed to vacate the dining room, like in so many other places!. Heaps of fresh, home cooked food was just what you wanted before a day sightseeing.
Noel recommended some great restaurants, and will even book tables for you! The service provided was just exceptional all round! We will definitely be recommending this to all of our friends and hope to return again one day! Thank you, No 31 for a fantastic weekend",5,2009,05,10
216,Great Place,"My wife and I traveled to Dublin for the first time last year, and were lucky enough to have found this gem.  We were told that the room would be small, but it was actually a little larger than the other rooms we stayed in while in other European cities.  The staff was very friendly and helpful.  As all the other reviews will tell you, breakfast was amazing every morning, and was even cooked to order.  If Pat is still there, get to know him, he's a great guy with good insights about the city, my wife and I really enjoyed talking with him and the other staff.  Definitely enjoy tea and chocolate chip cookies in sunken lounge.  The only negative is that it is a little farther away from Temple Bar than we expected.",5,2009,04,26
216,Absolutely wonderful!,"Number 31 could not have been a more perfect place to kick off our tour of Ireland last summer.  From the gorgeous scent of the candles when you first walk in, to the fantastic hospitality, Number 31 can't be beat.  Noel and his staff truly exemplify Irish Hospitality. The breakfast alone is worth the stay.  (I knew we would be hard pressed to find breakfast as delicious the rest of our stay and unfortunately I was right!)  The rooms are comfortable and cozy - the bath products fantastic.  If I ever have the pleasure of returning to Dublin, I will be booking here again, without a doubt.",5,2009,04,23
216,Super stay,"Such a lovely place. Warm and friendly welcoming, helpful without being to instrusive and the breakfast is fab. Beds and ben linen where amazing, most sumptuous bed i've ever slept in.

A real treat.",4,2009,04,07
216,Perfect spot to see Dublin!,"Two friends and I stayed at Number 31 a few weeks ago, and could not have been happier.  Noel, at Number 31, was a delight to work with prior to the trip, answering our questions with patience and kindness.  We arrived at Number 31 after a long day of traveling and delightful Noel met us at the door, took our luggage, parked our car, and made sure we were settled in and had our bearings for our night out in Dublin.  He gave us wonderful suggestions for restaurants, and mapped out great streets for our visit.  The breakfasts were delicious and cooked to order.  The place is charming and within walking distance to many of the ""must see"" sights of Dublin.  The only problem that we had was a wee bit of trouble finding the street and the ""check in""  door to Number 31.  You will want to make sure that you are paying close attention to the small side streets and that you have concise directions.  With the exception of having a small issue finding the place, everything was absolutely delightful!  I highly recommend this place!",5,2009,03,22
216,Could not have a found a better place in Dublin - not even the Shelbourne,"The personal welcome set the tone for an incredible stay at Number 31. It felt like we were at home with new friends, a comfortable environment and great food. We didn't spend too much time there with so much to see in Dublin, but they made sure we made the most of our time. Gave us personalized tips on where to go and what to see and bent over backwards to make sure we had a great stay. We'll be back and we're brining some friends and family along! Thanks to the whole crew at No. 31 for making our trip so great!",5,2009,03,21
216,"Outstanding location, relaxing home in Dublin","We would definitely stay there anytime in Dublin again.  The proprietors felt like family, proud of their city, helped us to make the most of our stay .  The location is in walking distance to everything, yet in a quiet and peaceful setting.  We stayed in the Georgian building where the rooms are historically beautiful with a modern twist, and excellent large bathrooms.  Noel goes above and beyond to ensure you have an excellent trip, with him you are in good hands.",5,2009,03,19
216,"Friendly, warm, cozy, comfy, beautiful, welcoming, romantic -- shall I go on?","This guest house is a great base for exploring Dublin. Noel, the owner, is charming and makes everyone feel so welcome and appreciated. The public areas of the hotel are cozy as can be and the rooms are sumptuous. 

We stayed in room #42, it was on the top floor of the Georgian townhouse and it was our home away from home. We actually hoped for the weather to be cold and rainy so we could just stay in all day...

As it was, the hotel was walking distance to everything and we enjoyed our entire stay in Dublin. And like every other reviewer has mentioned, the breakfast was delish! I try to start the day on the healthy side with a bowl of oatmeal, and I must say the porridge at Number 31 is as tasty as I've ever had. While I would recommend it highly, my boyfriend would argue the salmon omelette or the full Irish would win the prize. 

If you stay here, a  restaurant called the Pearl Brasserie is nearby and should not be missed.",5,2009,03,10
216,Great place to stay ....heads and shoulders above normal hotels,"I found the hotel great.  The room was beautifully decorated and the details was sublime.  I loved the food on offer and the friendliness of the staff was terrific.  If I was to make a couple of honest comments I would say that there were a few details that should have been better on room preparation relative to the price paid for the weekend.  they were things like we had empty water bottles in our room, one light bulb in the bathrooms was gone and the lamp in the room was broken, i also prefer a large double rather than two singles together and the last crticism should have internet available.  I am only picking hairs but being completely honest..... agreat great hotel probably the best I have ever stayed in, just wish these things were cheaper in life!!!",5,2009,02,09
216,Excellent service in a home from home,"We stayed in this guest house for one night and thoroughly enjoyed it.  We were greeted by Noel who is charming, courteous, helpful and entertaining and ensured we had all the information we required to explore Dublin and enjoy our stay. Our car was parked free of charge which was a pleasant surprise but apparently 'all part of the service'.  Breakfast was absolutely delicious and our room immaculate.

If you're looking for a large 5 star bling hotel this is not for you but  we would really recommend this place for anyone who values personal service, attention to detail and a warm home from home feeling.",5,2009,02,09
216,"Fabulous hotel, amazing service, couldn't be better!","We had a fantastic experience at Number 31 from the moment we arrived off the red eye.  Nole, the owner, welcomed us with an amazing, complimentary breakfast and set us up with maps and advice for the day.  From that moment on he took care of us with terrific food, advice and service.  I went with three of my girlfriends and we originally booked one large suite for the 4 of us to share.  After our first night the owner moved two of us to the room next door - for free! - to make our stay more enjoyable.  The rooms were great with very comfortable beds with soft duvees and linens.  The bathrooms were modern with good hair dryers and shampoos.  The hotel is in a fantastic, central location and we walked to all the sites in Dublin.  The daily morning breakfast was as good as all the reviews said (especially the Soda Bread) and kept us going throughout the day.  We had a wonderful trip to Dublin - largely due to our home away from home at Number 31!",5,2009,02,06
216,A home away from home!,"I stumbled across Number 31 thanks to the glowing Tripadvisor reviews and I have to say that I was actually even more impressed when we arrived.

Noel immediately greeted us like family and wittily went through  the map & list of things to do & we all felt at ease straight away.

Nothing was too much trouble and I can definitely echo the other reviews re the brekkie - top notch!

The rooms were lovely - a tasteful mixture of old & new and my parents were even upgraded as it was my mum's 60th birthday.

I have already recommended this gem to everyone I've spoken to about the trip and would definitely go back if in Dublin again.",5,2009,02,02
216,Best in Dublin!,"We have been fortunate to travel in many cities and countries thoughout the world, from major cites to the Caribeaan and beyond, and have never found a more friendly and accomodating staff or service, anywhere, and we have typically stayed in 4/5 Star properties, most always.
The owner and staff of Number 31 have the ""lock"" on customer satisfaction, from the moment you are greeted by Noel (the owner) with tea/coffee, on arrival. 
The rooms, location, service and Irish Breakfast cannot be beat in Dublin!
As a Business owner, myself,  here in the USA, I appreciate the attention, effort and detail the owner of Number 31 provides to set the tone for his staff and his personal expectations for every guest.
It is rare to see this kind of service and customer care and what will keep Number 31 on the top in Ireland.",5,2009,02,01
216,A great time at number 31!,"The hotel was really great! And the owner nice and very helpfull. Not to mention the breakfast, it was the best hotelbreakfast that we've ever tried!

Central location, easy to find.

If we go back to Dublin, we will stay at number 31!",4,2009,01,28
216,Loved it!,"We have just returned from a long weekend in Dublin, staying at Number 31.  We booked it based on all the excellent reviews from Trip Advisor.  We weren't disappointed.  The location was good in an upmarket part of town - away from the noisy city centre, but only a 10 minute walk away.

Noel was very welcoming from the moment we arrived.  He asked the purpose of our trip and suggested a number of places to visit and more importantly brilliant (out of the tourist way) restaurants.  Our room was large, airy and clean with a comfortable bed.  The only complaint was the bathroom was quite cold and dark - but for a short stay you can put up with that!!

We challenged Noel on their statement ""best breakfasts in Ireland"" - thinking that a little farmhouse B&B in the middle of Galway might say different.  But we were proven wrong - the breakfasts were lush.  Set us up for the day and certainly didn't need anything else (apart from a guinness) until  dinner!  The Cranberry and Walnut bread was so good.  Have already printed the recipe off their website to bake!",4,2009,01,27
216,Horrible,"After reading good reviews about Number 31 we really thought we were in for a treat. Sadly, this was not the case. The owner was pleasant enough, but the room was terrible. We stayed in the coach block and would not recommend it. Windowless, freezing (apparently there was a problem with the heating),  carpet badly stained and it looked as if the furnishings had not changed in 20 years.  There was even a dismantled sink and plumbing equipment in the wardrobe. I know retro is back, but there are limits! We were also woken up several times when guests arrived back, staff prepared breakfast , car alarms went off and the use of a guest bathroom just outside our door. The extractor fan never goes off!  The whole of the coach house needs updating, a good clean and sound proofing. Sorry, but it spoilt our stay in Dublin. Not recommended.",1,2009,01,26
216,fabulous time at no 31,"What can i saw about no 31? I have stayed in many a 4 & 5 star hotel,but never expierenced service like i recieved in no 31,nothing is too much trouble,one of the staff,pat overheard me saying i was cold ,he offered me tea and cookies and lit the open fire for me.The room and bathroom were spotless and the bed very comfortable,i stayed in the old part of the hotel which i preferred,though the new part was equally as nice.As others have said the breakfast are so yummy,if only i had the recipe for the walnut and cranberry bread, ! the only negative i can find is my expanding waistline after eating all that lovely food.
When i came home my husband said surprisley YOU STAYED IN A GUEST HOUSE but i said oh no, 31 is not your  ordinary guest house,thats why im taking him in march for our anniversary. can t wait to go back,im sure you will not get a warmer reception anywhere better than no 31",5,2009,01,04
216,At Home in the City,"An architectural feat! Number 31 is actually a well executed modernization of several connecting townhouses which retain the flavors of Dublin’s past while updating features and fixtures to state of the art modern, including a stylish marble bathroom and amenities. Lots of small touches: a lovely city garden, lobby sitting area, great breakfasts and gracious, knowledgeable hosts. Located just off St. Stephens Green, short walks to most Dublin attractions.",5,2008,12,12
216,A real gem in Dublin - try it you will love it,"I had recommended Number 31 to a work colleague after seeing a review of it somewhere. He loved it so I thought I would try it for myself whilst I was in Dublin on business.
I was not disappointed. A very charming boutique hotel - lovely welcoming arrival - the candles are a lovely touch in the public areas. The room was very stylish and the bed and linen very comfortable.
Breakfast next morning was an absolute delight - Noel was on hand to greet me and I had the nicest breakfast that I have EVER had in a hotel ( and I have travelled widely).
I wish  more hotels offered this level of comfort and service for this price.
I would not hesitate to recommend Number 31 to both business and leisure travellers - its a real gem.
Go and try it for yourselves......",5,2008,11,27
216,Eclectic and fantastic,"A lovely, quirky place with a warm welcome from Noel and family.  Lovely rooms, super breakfast, good location, fascinating history and architecture.

Only thing that could improve is the lighting, rooms moody and for women, tough to find somewhere to make-up.

A wonderful base to explore Dublin.",5,2008,11,23
216,Very good but expensive,"We recently spent 5 nights at No. 31, in a family room for 3. The breakfasts are justly praised and the welcome by Noel (with tea and biscuits) very much appreciated.

The beds were comfortable, the bathroom very chic if a bit impractical (no shelving units as mentioned by other posters).
The poor lighting in the room made reading difficult.

Otherwise, it should be noted this is not really a hotel, more a guesthouse - no restaurant, no mini-bar. As such, the prices are a bit steep.

The bit we stayed in is a Georgian townhouse, beautifully restored and maintained, on elegant Fitzwilliam Place. Though it's a very busy street, we were only really bothered on the first night when several hotel residents arrived (drunk, I presume) and at 2:30 a.m. launched into a raucous, very extended conversation in the hallway.. just outside our door. Not the hotel's fault, but a couple of hours later, we were awakened by drunks in the street (it must be said there are a LOT of drunks in Dublin, it even beats London!) raised hell.",4,2008,10,30
216,Great Location,"On our arrival I thought Number 31 would be too far from the town centre, but soon realized  it was in a great location. Off a quiet lane and not on a busy street as I noticed a lot of other small hotels.  Noel and his beautiful wife and daughter as well as the rest of the staff were very helpful and friendly.  I do not know how Noel remembers everyones name.  As stated he is know for his delightful and filling breakfasts.  The hotel is charming and has a lot of character.  You do not feel as if you are in a big City. We stayed here for 6 nights. My husband and I loved the large shower and showerhead .  My only suggestion would be to have a vanity of some kind in the bathroom to put your toiletries, etc,.  and to have the hairdryer in the bathroom.  There also needs to be a mirror in the room other than the tall mirror on the floor.  The lighting seems to need  higher watts for the bulbs.  Loved the candles all over the public areas as well as the wonderful linens and Molton Brown amenities.",4,2008,10,18
216,A Gem,"I booked this guesthouse after doing my research on this website and I was not disappointed. Having visited Dublin a couple of years ago staying in a chain hotel on O'Connell St I was keen to experience a different side to Dublin away from the tacky Temple Bar area,even if it meant paying a little more in an expensive city.
 My husband and I were warmly welcomed by all staff, especially the wonderful Noel who greets you as a long lost friend. Nothing is too much trouble for him, he made us tea and cookies one time after a day of sightseeing.Breakfast is amazing and everything about the place(food, decor, furnishings etc) is top quality.
 We had a standard room on the top floor in the Georgian house, I prefered this as I like to be on the top floor so I don't get disturbed by footsteps from the room above. Yes there are a few flights of stairs but as we are youngish it didn't bother us! Room was clean, linen and furniture of a high standard and I am a sucker for nice toiletries so the Molten Brown goodies went down very well! We love a place with character so loved the house. The only way in which you could better the room would be maybe to have a dressing table area in room rather than just a long mirror on the floor, a few shelves and hooks in the bathroom and a kettle for a late night drink. The hairdyer was an excellent salon style one too. There was a patch of mould on our bedroom ceiling but as everything else was so good it didn't bother us though it may bother others.
 Only thing to watch out for is finding it when you arrive! Although it's in a lovely area Number 31 is discreetly hidden down a side road and even a taxi driver couldn't get us there so arm yourself with good directions.

 We will remember our brief stay for a long time and would not stay anywhere else in Dublin. Thank you Noel and family for your hospitality.",5,2008,10,15
216,A very special place,"This is a real find, a lovely boutique-style hotel close to St. Stephens Green and the centre, yet far from the madding crowd.  

It feels like a home from home, run by a charming host, Noel, and his family.  The home-made breakfasts are five-star, with a choice of scrambled eggs and smoked salmon, kippers, cheese omelette or a full Irish breakfast, with plenty of freshly-brewed coffee and fresh orange juice.  Tea or coffee with home made fruit cake is served during the day and although I was travelling alone I felt extremely welcome - and reluctant to leave!

I slept like a log on the feather nest-style bed with luxury Swedish pillows, and the modern bathroom-showers, complete with Molton Brown goodies and fluffy white towels were a great way to start the day before venturing down to the breakfast area where you have a choice of an indoor breakfast room or the enclosed, glass-covered ""atrium"" with trees and a garden area outside.

You could while away a rainy afternoon just in the reception area with its candles, beautiful flower arrangements and a real fire, just reading the coffee table books and the weekend papers...

In a nutshell, excellent: lovely rooms, lots of character, pretty courtyards, good food and an atmosphere that would be hard to beat.  Very special.",5,2008,10,11
216,We loved it!!!,"My wife and I stayed here for 4 nights.  We were expecting a very nice hotel from all the reviews we had seen.  It was all we expected and more.  We arrived at 9 am from a flight from the US.  Noel greeted us at the door and invited us for breakfast.  While we ate, he made sure that our room was ready for us without a wait.  We had great recommendations for restaurants and Noel made the reservations.  We could not have been treated better.  Everything about this place makes you want to return to Dublin.  Absolutely a great property with all the hospitality one could ever expect.",5,2008,10,07
216,Warm Welcome in Great Location,"The first thing you learn about Number 31 is that you are not a stranger; Noel greets you as though you are a valued return guest -- someone whose visit has been eagerly anticipated.  

An early arrival meant we didn't expect to be able to check in, but we did hope the hotel could store our luggage.  We were welcomed with open arms and whisked into the lovely conservatory for an incredible breakfast (cereal, breads, fruit, juice, yogurt, toast, AND a choice of made-to-order eggs, such as Eggs Benedict, Mushroom Fritata, or a Full Irish breakfast).  Then, we were quickly installed in our lovely rooms in the Georgian Townhome -- all of this before 10:30 a.m.!

We sincerely appreciated the location only 5 minutes from the beautiful St. Stephens Green and another 10 minutes or so through the park to City Center and Grafton Street.

This property has much to recommend it: excellent location, wonderful breakfast, exceptionally caring hosts, charming accommodations blending new (great bed and linens; some colorful modern furniture) and old (Georgian townhome architecture).  A lovely sort of Zen-English garden links the more modern coach house with the Georgian Townhome where the bedrooms are located.

There are some negatives to consider before booking.  Stairs -- potentially lots of them.  We walked four flights to our room (56 stairs).  Candles -- many are in use throughout the property.  The fragrance can be overwhelming and the idea that lit candles are left unattended is a bit disconcerting.  Absent amenities -- our room had a mirror in the bathroom, but the hair dryer had to be used in the bedroom.  This was cumbersome.

Street side rooms can be somewhat noisy, but garden side rooms are quieter.

Overall, we were very, very pleased with Number 31 and most certainly recommend it.  On my next visit, however, I would ask for a mirror and I would request a quieter garden-side room.  Additionally, I would ask about the candles; I'd like to see those eliminated.",4,2008,10,04
216,"Very very  nice, but could be better.","Positives:

1.  Great location, within walking distance of shopping/sites of interest/restaurants, but on a quiet street.
2.  Lovely, warm welcome by host.
3.  Fabulous breakfasts, superbly prepared, with attention to detail. 
4.  Nicely appointed room with large comfortable bed and nice linens.
5.   Beautiful, architecturally interesting property.  

Negatives:

1.  Bathroom not well thought out -  too small, and absolutely  no shelves in shower or by sink, so no place to place toiletries, makeup, shampoo or soap except on floor! 
2.  Terrible lighting in bathroom - impossible to apply makeup properly, or to see to do much of anything. These first two negatives may seem insignificant, but for three days, they proved to be very irritating.  
3.  Television reception was non-existent.  
4.  Only 20 minutes of wireless internet was provided for free; after that, it was expensive to purchase.
5.  Fragrant candles were constantly lit throughout common areas of house - caused allergic reaction with congestion and sneezing throughout my whole stay.",4,2008,09,27
216,Number 31 is number 1,"Exceptional, charming, friendly, welcoming. We stayed 5 nights at Number 31 and loved everything about it. Noel is such a wonderful host. Arriving here after a red-eye flight felt like coming home for Thanksgiving. Waking up to a full breakfast every morning was like being at mom's house. Smoked salmon and scrambled eggs, full Irish breakfast, mushroom frittata, cheese omelette, granola, cereal, delicious coffee, whatever your heart desires. It is a 15 minute picturesque walk to Temple Bar through St. Stephen's Green. Hotels in Temple Bar may claim to have the location, but unless you want to hear sloppy drunks all night it's actually much nicer to come home to a peaceful neighborhood where Number 31 is located. The rooms were so charming and cozy and the bathroom was newly renovated and spacious. Our rooms were cleaned by the time we came back from breakfast. Noel will arrange a cab for you for that 545am tour or back to the airport and he'll help you get your luggage to the curb. He greeted us on a first-name basis every morning and always had a smile on his face. I would go there again and again.",5,2008,09,24
216,Amazing hospitality and such comfortable beds!,"Number 31 is a truly fantastic hotel. 

The most warm, sincere welcome we have ever received at a hotel, and certainly preferable to the formal, mechanical 'welcome's' at larger hotels.

A superbly luxurious and comfortable bed that frankly neither my boyfriend nor I wanted to get out of in the morning!

Delicious breakfast in a very stylish, peaceful surrounding.

Great location off St Stephen's Green, which we found very convenient for most tourist attractions if you are on a relaxed sightseeing schedule.

We had a room off the main lounge area, which we were dubious about at the start, but it really wasn't an issue for us as we weren't usually back in our room until midnight anyway. However, if you are a light-sleeper, this wouldn't be the best room for you. Having said that, if you are a young couple, ask expressly for this room and you will not be disappointed! A great '70's vibe to the decor and a bathroom to die for. One small niggle was the carpet, which was very uncomfortable on bare feet and had water marks in places, and the harsh strip lighting above the dressing area mirror.

To be perfectly honest, you could forgive these lot pretty much anything! They make you feel so welcome and valued as a guest, with great little touches such as making a point of using your name when saying good morning/afternoon and Noel's compact guide to sightseeing and dining in Dublin. Nothing is too much trouble for them, and the number of glowing reviews on Tripadvisor should be testament to the amount of heart and effort which clearly goes in to running the hotel.

We really cannot recommend this hotel highly enough, and would like to see one in every European city please!",5,2008,09,16
216,best hotel in dublin,"we really loved this place. great atmosphere, very nice and smiling people and deliciuos breakfast, very interesting design, a great address!",4,2008,08,24
216,Brilliant stay at 31!,"We arrived in Dublin early, making it into town by taxi by 7:30 am. We stopped at Number 31 (delightful door in a charming alley) to drop off our bags and go exploring. We were welcomed by Noel who enveloped us with Irish hospitality and insisted we come in for breakfast. Breakfast was amazing and the place delightful. The primary common areas were in the carriage house. Breakfast was served in a garden room and included the Irish basics but also things like fresh fruit and eggs benedict. We returned later in the day to comfortable beds and generous rooms. Noel was the best. I would highly recommend this location. It was our favorite in all of Ireland. Thanks to Noel and his family.

Jim and Mary Leffler, Virginia",5,2008,08,18
216,If you go to Dublin......,I have traveled all over Europe and have stayed in some of the most extraordinary accomodations but I must say that my experience at 'Number 31' was absolutely wonderful for one very special reason: hospitality. I have never been welcomed with such sincerity and warmth before. I cannot imagine how my visit to Ireland would have been without first starting and ending here.,5,2008,08,17
216,Absolutely Fantastic!,"This perfect ""bed and breakfast"" was our favorite stay in all of Ireland!  It is tucked away on a little street in Dublin.  You feel like you are in a world of beautiful gardens, far away from the city center - when in reality, you are a five minute stroll from St. Stephen's Green.  The rooms are huge and gorgeous, and the breakfasts are to die for.  It was the most amazing food we had.  I still think about the cranberry and walnut soda bread.  This place is worth the money, the family and staff is beyond friendly and accomodating; make sure you stay more than one night!  This is truly one of Ireland's most perfect places!",5,2008,08,13
216,Perfect!!!!,"This is a fabulous guest house close to all the sites in Dublin.
The family that owns the property does an outstanding job of making you feel welcome and helping you get around the city.
The breakfasts were some of the best we had in Ireland.",5,2008,08,02
216,Lovely hotel in a charming city,"Our stay at this lovely hotel was relaxed and enjoyable. We were there for 5 days. The hotel, especially the coach house, has a nice feel about it and Dublin itself was a real treat - the people are great!

The hotel is situated within 5-10 mins walk of Grafton Street (main shopping area) and the city tourist sites. 

We had a hire car and it was parked free on the hotel secure car park - the night watchman even parked it for us which was great - he really was a star by the way and couldn't do enough for you - a big thank you to him.

Breakfast was very good and plentiful with the emphasis on quality, freshness. Officially brreakfast was until 10am but it really wasn't an issue if you were 10 to 15 mins late, as we were a few times! You were seated either in the dining area within the coach house or in the attached conservatory which we all preferred. A big thank you to Noel and the gang there.

Coffee, tea, milk, hot chocolate with biscuits were served anytime through-out the day in the sitting area of the coach house with a lovely fire burning away. Although it was great to be served we felt that we still would have liked to have had the flexibilty to have tea-making facilities in the room, just a small point though.

Our room was a family room in the basement of the adjoining Georgian house. The room was spacious and the beds and linen were very confortable. There wasn't a view as it was in the basement, but the window was large enough to let in day light. On the subject of light, I would say that the lighting in the bathroom could be improved - it was rather dim in there making it tricky for us to shave, apply make-up, etc. The bathroom was very nicely set-out with marble, and a great rain-head shower and had Molton Brown toiletries. 

The radiators were on morning and evening to take the chill off - we had to turn them down though as it could get very warm!

There was a DVD player in the room - although it said in the welcoming letter in the room that there was a selection of DVDs available, the choice for kids was limited, although they did enjoy watching The Wizard of Oz again and then Singin' in the Rain!

Minor housekeeping points- easy chairs were wobbly as a couple of castors were missing, light bulbs in two lamps weren't replaced and used drinking glasses weren't changed on a daily basis but these were minor points and didnot spoil our stay in any way. I am sure that if we had said something about this then they would have sorted this. The hotel provides plenty of complimentary bottled water by the way.

We would definitely stay there again! It felt more personal and homely than a faceless big chain hotel.",5,2008,07,23
216,Great Stay!,"A lovely hotel conveniently located near the center of Dublin, yet far enough away from the noise and bustle to be relaxing. Our room was clean, comfortable, and quiet. The bathroom was impressive--a rainshower shower head and marble finishings. Hotel staff was very nice. We stayed at several hotels and B&Bs on our trip and the breakfast here was by far the best we had--everything was amazing.",5,2008,07,21
216,Close but...,"Number 31 does not live up to the hype.  

My sister and I stayed there and while it was safe and comfortable we are still waiting for our promised wake-up call for the day of our departure and we are still waiting for the promised help with our luggage down two flights of stairs, across the garden, and up another flight of stairs.   

The B&B is in a Georgian townhouse so there are no elevators (not a problem for us, but a warning for future visitors) but a lot of stairs.  The people cleaning our room  never removed glasses we'd used the night before for drinking water.  We came back in from a full day of sightseeing and there were our ""dirty"" glasses still sitting there.  We had to ask for a top sheet, preferring that instead of the duvet. That personal choice was attended to.  

The office staff must be ferreted out. The office is through the kitchen.

On a positive side the breakfasts are delicious, and there is a lovely glassed-in place for dining.  When you come in after a day of sightseeing it is possible (if you find someone upstairs) to have coffee or tea and a cookie beside the fire in the sunken reception area.  The staff is knowledgeable and precise about directions.  

If, after a full day of sightseeing you want something other than coffee or tea, you must walk far afield for a pub.  Once you are in for the night, that's it.  

During our stay there were a couple of other guests who apparently were repeat customers.  My sister and I agreed--if we are able to return to Dublin--we won't be among them.",3,2008,07,11
216,Excellent hospitality,"Number 31 was our first stop during a recent first time visit to Ireland in April 2008 .  What a wonderful way to begin our  amazing vacation.  We stayed for 5 nights in a warm and spacious room in one of two houses connected by a picturesque courtyard. Excellent location close to St. Stephen's Green and within walking distance to so many other Dublin attractions.  Hospitality was outstanding and the choice of gourmet delights from the daily breakfast selection was superb.  Highly recommend this great guest house in Dublin.  Thanks to our host Noel, Rebecca, Ann and wonderful staff and chefs.

Colleen",5,2008,07,10
216,Quaint and Charming,We arrrived early in the morning after a long flight and we were promptly greeted with a beauftiful Irish breakfast.  The rooms were beautfiul and the beds extremely comfortable.  If you are traveling with seniors request a room on the first or basement floor as they have many levels.  This place set the bar for the rest of our trip and nothing lived up to it.,4,2008,07,09
216,"Number 31, Dublin -- a keeper!","I wouldn't consider staying anywhere else in Dublin! Number 31 is on Leeson Close, and although it's just off busy Leeson St. (with buses readily available), it's very quiet. We stayed in the 50's-style converted carriage house, made cozy by the peat blocks burning in the fireplace. For variety, next time I may want to try the Georgian section, accessible beyond the garden.
  Hosts Anne and Noel are smart and accommodating. When she heard that we wanted to visit Glendaloch one morning, Anne promptly booked us with the very best tour company, and we walked the few blocks to the pick-up stop. It couldn't have been easier. 
  I'm sure many guests return just for the breakfasts, which are truly delicious! There's everything from the full Irish to the simpler fruit-yoghurt-cereal, with a wide array of fresh and precooked fruits (including stewed rhubarb!).
  I'll be going back for the Swedish beds and down comforters, too, and now I'm hooked on their special washing products (one contained ginseng, the other, pepper), which provided a spa-like experience.
  Already dreaming about my next trip!",5,2008,07,05
216,Fabulous! The best place to stay in Dublin!,"From stepping through the door at Number 31 until we left the service was excellent. Located just off Leeson St. it is an easy stroll into the centre of Dublin, but also has a couple of excellent restaurants and a pub nearby. The accomodation is unusual but imaculate. I had forgot to mention that my mother was travelling with us, however on arrival without even asking she was switched to a ground floor room. The accomodation is split across 2 buildings, with the majority of rooms in a 4 storey georgian town house across the garden - plus a few rooms and breakfast all being served in a coach house re-worked in an unusual modern style. Rooms are immaculate, breakfast amazing, only surpassed by the Irish charm of the management!",4,2008,06,21
216,wonderful time at the number 31,EVERYTHING WAS SUPERB at this tucked away b&b historic gem - from the staff to the breakfasts to the most fantastic bed we're ever had!!!!We would stay here again in a heartbeat!,5,2008,06,19
216,Overrated.. in my opinion.,"After reading the reviews of this place, and hearing some other people talk about it, I had very high expectations. I'm not saying it was a dump by any means, but it didnt live up to my hopes. 

I'll start with the good things. The manager ( or owner) is great. He comes out to personally greet you and walks you through a breakdown of the hotel and area. He also greeted us, and waited on us  for breakfast every morning --very professional. Its perfect for people who are not familiar with the area (like us). So that was very nice and helpful touch . Second, the breakfast was very good. One of the best ""free"" breakfasts I have ever had, and served in a great setting, especially if you are the greenhouse. And another postive point was the hotel was small, and easy to figure out. Nothing complicated or confusing about it. Location seemed good as well, within walking distance to most attractions.

The bad-- I found the hotel lobby to be similar to that of Austin Powers moview. Very tacky 60s-70s set up with a sunken living room and wierd mirrors and lighting. Sure, it was different, but I found it to come across as dirty and outdated. Our room was in the basement and felt very dark and cramped. We had virtually no view, and no sunlight. In Dublin there isnt much sunlight to begin with, so this make it even worse. The room was nicley decorated, but still cramped, especially the bathroom. Great shower, but very small space. Only one person can be the bathroom at a time. im not saying all rooms were like mine, some were probably better. 

Dont get me wrong, I can see why many people might love this place, but for me it just didnt live up to the hype.",3,2008,06,12
216,Number 31 in Dublin,"I'm normally not inclined to write reviews, but I felt compelled to do so after reading the other reviews.   My wife and I stayed at Number 31 in the fall of 2005, and we would definitely return.

Our room was in a lovely old Georgian house, and our only complaint might be that we were on the top floor and it was back breaking to haul all of our luggage up there.   However, I'd be the last person to suggest adding an elevator to a historic house.

Otherwise, the room was very nice, and we found the staff to be friendly enough.   No one was waiting on us 24 hours a day, but they were available when necessary.   However, I would like to point out that we were initially greeted by the owner who served us afternoon tea before showing us to our room.

Regarding the breakfast, at least in the fall of 2005, it was absolutely outstanding.  We stayed 2 nights, and we had a wonderful meal each morning.",5,2008,06,12
216,Excellent,"Husband and I stayed at Number 31 for two nights at the end of May and were very impressed.  Lovely room at the front of the house, very nicely furnished, great bathroom and spotless.  Some traffic noise in the mornings but quite nice to wake up to the buzz of Dublin.  Lovely mews garden.  Great breakfasts and lovely staff.  Five minutes to Grafton Street even at my snail pace!!  We would have extended our stay but they were fully booked.  We will definitely stay here again.",5,2008,06,05
216,Loved Number31,"Wonderful experience from the moment we arrived. Extremely hospitable. They provided great guidance on what to do and where to eat, even parked my rental for me.  And the breakfasts - fantastic, best scrambled eggs we found in Ireland.  About the only slight negative was that the rooms were a bit warm.  I will say that we found this to be the case every place we stayed.",5,2008,06,04
216,Loved Number 31,"We have just returned from a 10 day trip around Ireland. Our first night was in Number 31 which gave the rest of our accommodations a lot to live up to!
Our welcome was warm, friendly and the sunken sitting room quirky but very relaxing. (The green tea also helped).
Our room was huge, beautifully decorated and spotlessly clean. 
Location very good about 20 - 30 mins walk from centre of Dublin.
Breakfast excellent.",5,2008,05,09
216,A lovely hotel!,"I guarantee that you will never find a more friendly, warm and welcoming hotel than Number31 in Dublin. 
The folks at Number31 are true professionals.  From the instant you arrive the staff is committed to your comfort, creating an atmosphere that gives you the feeling you are returning to the home of an old friend!  
Your check in is preceded by a cup of tea or coffee, accompanied with two biscuits of course.  As you sit in front of the fire wondering why your arrival has caused such a fuss, your luggage is whisked off, waiting for you in your room.
The owner is a former military man, trained in efficiency and hospitality. After you’ve settled in he sits with each guest and goes over the layout and highlights of Dublin, a city he is certainly proud of and one that he promotes quite well.  Each morning he greets you at breakfast with a hearty welcome and handshake. His charm and demeanor leave you feeling that you are his guest of honor.  
Regarding breakfast, they are quite proud of their breakfast at Number31 and they should be.  What a spread! Everything is great but when in Ireland… order the Full Irish Breakfast.  
The hotel’s location is terrific.  Just blocks from the park, St Stephens Greens, and within walking distance to restaurants, shopping, museums and of course pubs. 
I would without a doubt stay at Number31 again.  In fact, Dublin is frankly a nicer city to visit when you wake up and go to bed each day at this gem of a hotel.",5,2008,04,22
216,"Quality  and quirky, great little place to stay","I have just returned from a lovely three night stay at Number 31, with my daughter.  A very warm welcome awaited us on our arrival.  Our room was spotless, the beds were extremely comfortable, and we loved the somewhat quirky decor.  The en-suite bathroom was spacious and toasty warm.  Great shower with lots of room to move.

The breakfast choice and quality was absolutely amazing.  You just couldn't fault it, from the fresh juice, to made to order porridge, delicious Irish breakfast, bowls of wonderfully fresh fruit.  Nothing was too much trouble for the friendly staff.  I have stayed in many 5* hotels whose breakfast quality and choice were nowhere as good as Number 31.

It isn't cheap, it is good value.  Location is fine, a short walk to the main shopping centre.  A very well run establishment that certainly enhances the reputation of Dublin for quality and friendliness.",5,2008,04,21
216,A great welcome,"This is a very special place. It is not a hotel, but it is unlike any other B&B I have ever used! 
   The tall town house at one end of the site is decorated and furnished beautifully, with unusual colour schemes which respect its age - Georgian with 19th century additions - and modern but appropriate furniture. Our room was here, with an exceptionally comfy bed, and yes, we had a key to the front door of this building, to come and go as we liked. 
   The narrow formal garden links the house to a fine 1960s mews house designed by Sam Stephenson, a Dublin architect, and apart from the original built-in sunken seating area by the peat fire, is furnished in cool modern classic style. There are some rooms here and breakfast is offered in an upper room and adjoining conservatory.
    The breakfasts are of  very high quality, taken at long tables in the 1960s house. We found interesting people to talk to and share our experiences of visiting Ireland. The owners were thoughtful and welcoming hosts who clearly enjoy running this lovely place, though the number of stairs must leave them exhausted! They treat everyone with care and are happy to provide advice about places to visit and how to get there. They provided tea, offered to include our friends in the breakfasts and booked us taxis.
   We will be back - and we will be recommending Number 31 to friends, though we fear this will only make it harder to get a booking!",5,2008,04,21
216,The Full Irish!,"We had two chances to experience this marvelous guesthouse near St. Stephen’s Green   – three nights at the start of our Ireland trip and three nights at the end. Both times we were warmly welcomed, well fed, and made exceedingly comfortable.

Number 31 offers the amenities of a hotel in the style of a guesthouse. Its aesthetic mixes the contemporary with the traditional.  The ""lobby"" resembles a living room with an array of books and newspapers and usually a peat fire burning.  On the level above is an airy breakfast room where every imaginable morning treat is spread out and hot breakfasts, including the awesome ""full Irish,"" made to order.  Coffee is served in individual French press pots, and the tea is excellent.

Whatever we needed - a computer connection, reliable arrangements for taxis, directions, stamps, you name it - the staff quickly and graciously provided.  Everyone was warm and friendly but never intrusive.  Even breakfast conversation was clearly optional.

In short, Number 31 represents the best of Irish hospitality.  We’ll be back!
Patricia & Benjamin",5,2008,04,12
216,Best rest; best breakfast.,"Number 31 has all the elegance of the Georgian town house for which Dublin is famed, with a wonderfully central location, and every conceivable luxury. 
With our two daughters, we were welcomed into a wide comfortable sunken lounge with warm log fire and  juice or tea and fruit bread all round.  We had by every conceivable Guide to the City with a selection of the day's newspapers and topical coffee table literature at our finger tips.
Breakfast at Number 31 is a celebration of fresh breads, fruit salads,cereals, 'Full Irish', 'Eggs Benedict', fresh fish, etc taken at a leisurely pace and topped up with more fresh tea, coffee, toast .......
The rooms are bright and fresh and the beds so unusually comfortable that for the first time after many visits  to top-end hotels I found myself looking for the labels on the beds, pillows and duvets! They were impressive. The standard of comfort was second to none and, for the first time, we were not desperate to get home to our own beds for a good night's sleep. We had great sleeps,  and despite several frantic days trying to take in every gallery, museum, library and shopping mall in this great city we returned to Number 31 feeling rested and looking forward to doing it all again. It is not easy to find such a great mix but Number 31 has achieved it in every respect.",5,2008,04,02
216,The staff was great and the bed was wonderful.,"A bit hard to find, it's on a side street off the main drag bearing the same name. Once there, I found the staff wonderful and the room quiet nice.  A little on the expensive side, for us Americans anyway, but the feel of being at home in downtown Dublin was worth it. I highly recommend the place.",5,2008,03,25
216,a great time,number 31 made my stay in dublin .. the staff was polite and made my trip very enjoyable ...everything was great from the round the clock service to the organic breakfast they made my stay,5,2008,03,04
216,Our home in Dublin,"The first time we stayed at Number 31, we broke up our Dublin visit with about a week of touring the country.   When we returned to Number 31 after driving around, I remarked to Noel that I knew it wasn't actually my home, but I felt like I was coming home.

7 years later, returning to Number 31 for our fourth stay (and our daughter's first), it's still like coming home.  Noel and Deidre are fabulous hosts and their staff follows in kind.

Here's all anyone needs to know about Number 31...  One morning at breakfast, we told Anne that we were going to the Green to use the playground.  She immediately suggested that our daughter might like to feed the ducks and offered up a bag of bread for the task.  It's that kind of experience.

The building is gorgeous, the rooms are the most comfortable in Europe, the breakfast the best anywhere and the people are some of the finest you'll meet.

Over the years, we've made 4 trips to Number 31 and have sent about a dozen people there.  None of these experiences have ever been anything short of fantastic.",5,2008,02,24
216,Incredible,"Those looking for a upscale, classy , contemporary Bed and Breakfast, look no further.

31 is located close to central Dublin, St. Stephens Green and Grafton Street. Walking distance to just about everything. The accomodations are exquisite! Your hosts, Noel and Anne, serve a wonderful breakfast every morning that would rank with the best Hotels anywere. They are also more than happy to guide you with thoughts and ideas of getting around the city and countryside.

One of the best traveling experiences I have ever had!",5,2008,02,24
216,"Great, truthfull, charming & goodpeople","People working there are simply magnificient. They make feel you as a personal customer and they always help you ina familiar way. It is a charming place, in a Georgian house with confortable rooms but the best is breakfast. Real fresh fruit, housemade marmelade, cooked in time sausages and eggs, everything ies almost perfect thanks to those two women in charge of this beatiful hotel.
And the position is very good: far enough from the center (Temple bar and drinking areas) but you can reach shoping center and old town in 10 minuts walk through the Staphen Green Park. A very good place to stay alone or with your couple.",5,2008,02,21
216,Perfect in every way,"Number 31 was everything that I hoped it would be.  The friendly staff made us feel welcome and relaxed.  Our huge room, with huge, comfortable bed was uncluttered with no fuss or frills- and the best breakfast in Dublin.",5,2008,02,13
216,Boutique hotel heaven,"I loved this place - it was friendly, centrally located and the breakfasts were amazing. I
t felt like nothing was too much trouble.. advice on restaurants, directions, tea and home made biscuits when I got in at night served by the open fire..
My room was great with a really comfortable bed and great shower. I travel to Dublin on business and from now on will be staying nowhere else!",5,2008,01,25
216,We like Number 31,"My wife and daughter and I visited Dublin on vacation and stayed at Number 31 for a week in early December 2007. We had a wonderful time in Dublin and enjoyed very much our stay at Number 31. Noel and his staff are warm and considerate hosts. They serve a fabulous breakfast with a very wide selection of foods. Some evenings we returned to the hotel after our various activities in Dublin and we were greeted with hot tea, hot coffee, and cookies which we enjoyed by the fireplace in the sunken living room before retiring to our rooms for the night. In addition, Number 31 is located in the heart of Dublin and is close to many of the main attractions of the City. We recommend Number 31 highly and plan to return on our next visit to Dublin.",5,2008,01,21
216,A great weekend in Dublin,"We spent a long weekend in Dublin in December 2007, our first trip to Ireland and loved everything about it (OK, maybe not the cold and rain!). After doing some research on Trip Advisor, we stayed at Number 31 hotel/B&B which was excellent. We had a very warm welcome with tea and cake in the beautiful sunken lounge of the old coach house part of the hotel. Then we were shown to our room in the Georgian house and it was definitely worth paying a bit extra for a superior room as it was more of a suite with a lovely sitting room area. I had asked for a room overlooking the garden, which I would definitely recommend doing as some rooms overlooked the road which I'm sure would have been a bit noisier. Our room was beautiful as was the bathroom with walk-in shower. The only downside was that the heating never seemed to be on for very long. If we returned to the room at 5 or 6 in the afternoon, the heating didn't come on until about 7. Living in the South of France, we're probably a bit spoilt, but it was pretty cold in Dublin in December, obviously! The staff were all really helpful, especially Patrick, the 'night porter', even offering to make us some coffee when we had to leave at 6a.m. in the morning.  Breakfasts were amazing and after a breakfast at Number 31, you didn't really need any lunch! Noel, the owner, was very friendly.
The shopping was great, especially so close to Christmas and we ate at some really excellent restaurants. The first evening, we ate at The Tea Room at the Clarence Hotel, after a drink in the Octagon bar. Excellent food and wine. Very impressive restaurant. The second night we ate at Peploes, which we loved, although my husband thought the painted mural made it a bit dated. Delicious food and again, great wine selection. Our last evening, we ate at Thorntons at the Fitzwilliam Hotel. Although the food was excellent, as we expected from a Michelin starred chef, unfortunately there wasn't a great deal of atmosphere as the restaurant was only half full, but it was a Monday evening. I'm sure on a Friday or Saturday evening, it's more lively.  We managed visits to Trinity College and the Kilmainham Gaol and did a lot of walking. Also got the train south to Dalkey, but a bit disappointing due to the rain and wind! 
All in all, we really loved Dublin and the people and hope to visit again soon.",5,2008,01,16
216,Can't wait to go back to Number 31!,"Arriving at Number 31 was a delightful experience!   We were immediately charmed by the generous spirit of friendship and hospitality we encountered from each of the staff.   The accomodations were extremely comfortable, the beds to die for!   Breakfasts were sumptuous.   We were truly pampered and can't wait to return!   We will happily recommend Number 31 to those traveling to Dublin.",5,2008,01,04
216,Excellent Accomodation and Value,"Number 31 was the perfect ""home base"" for us to explore Dublin. Its  central location, superb breakfast, and knowledgeable hostess made for a great stay! We were extended every courtesy imaginable, and I would not hesitate to stay here again. (And yes, the breakfast is incredible!)",5,2008,01,02
216,Lovely place but walls too thin,"Just back from a long weekend in Dublin where we stayed at Number 31. The hotel is great except for the fact that it has very thin walls. We could hear everything from the next door and you can imagine how pleased we were at 4.30 am when the couple next door started ""celebrating"" the new year. Breakfasts were delicious. On balance I would stay again but I would certainly recommend ear plugs....",4,2008,01,02
216,dont go!,"We were greeted outside the door....our family of 4...not allowed in. We were handed a 10euro and told we were being sent to another hotel....as the woman who had our suite was ill and could not be moved. You would think that for that kind of inconvenience we would have been put up somewhere else gratis ....or at another upscale boutique hotel. She sent us to a suites ""hotel"" that you enter through
an alley and it wreaked....i mean like late night at a bar...wreaked of smoke. Very disappointing and I would never attempt to go there again.",1,2007,12,04
216,Boutique Comfort,"Number 31 is a boutique hotel par excellence, an intimate space enhanced by a welcoming staff, divine breakfasts (with a perfect distance from the center to walk off the calories!). The beds are so comfortable, the shower head rains hot water, the towels are heated, your room is made up in a wink.  We stayed four nights, so we didn't get to sample each of the breakfast options, alas.  We recommend this location happily and without hesitation.",4,2007,12,02
216,Lovely Stay,"After a long trans-atlantic flight and jet lag, we walked into a secluded alley to a marvelous ivy'd door that was opened by staff with a huge smile and a warm welcome.   Although it was late morning, past breakfast, staff insisted we eat and led us up the a stunning greenhouse breaskfast room.   Oh and how they fed us!  A feast, so relaxing.   The picky sticky traveler in our group was immediately charmed and said he never felt so welcome any where.   It set the tone for our entire 2 week journey through Ireland.   

We stayed in the Georgian building, street level, in a splendid high celing room.   Our bed and linen were first rate.   Our room was quiet.   Nice bathroom.   Loved having the street entrance for convience, then a short walk through the small and beautiful courtyard to the lobby/breakfast building.  

The location is ideal, we walked everywhere.  

When I return to Dublin, I will positively revisit Number 31.",5,2007,10,31
216,Number 31 Exceeds Expectations,"We stayed at Number 31 (Room 19) for a week in September.  It is a beautiful boutique hotel in the Georgian area with a courtyard.   The manager, Anne, met us when we arrived and we were served coffee or tea and cookies (homemade).  We were served coffee and tea any time, day or night.  There is always someone around and the staff is, uniformly, friendly but unobtrusive, helpful, and they all seem happy.  Even to haul your heavy suitcases to your room.  Everything written about the breakfasts is true.  A served menu with vast variety and large portions as well as a buffet of fruits, cereals, homemade breads.  The owner, Neal, was always around at breakfast time and did a lot of taking orders and serving.  The portions are so large that I learned to say:  ""A small omelet, please.""  Number 31 does not serve lunch or dinner but there is a restaurant right across the alley (Cooper's) where we went several times.  Number 31 is close to St. Stephen's Green and several buses stop just outside.  We did not rent a car or need one, or want one, as traffic is heavy and there's really no place to park.  Our room, in a quiet location, was spotless and stayed that way.  The housecleaning staff worked hard and were efficient.  My husband had a cold when we arrived and the owner offered to get a doctor if he needed one.  We had booked a Newgrange tour with Mary Gibbons (it turned out to be an excellent tour) and there was a slip up (on her part) so the manager, Anne, got us in her own car and raced around Dublin to cat ch up with Mary Gibbons.  Find someone here in the U.S. who will do that!   We would definitely return!",5,2007,10,27
216,Our hopes were too high!,"A few weeks before leaving to Europe, we saw an article in the NY Times called something like, ""What to do in 3 days in Dublin.""  Since we were spending 3 days in Dublin we left our guidebooks at home and followed the advice of the article.  Turned out all the article's recommendations satisfied my expectations except staying at No. 31.  Overall it was okay so I feel bad griping.  I just thought it would be cooler, quainter, have more character.  I once stayed at a small hotel in Argentina that was kind of shabby but dripping with charm....  Well this place wasn't like that.  More like a medium-sized fixer-upper in a central part of town that still has broken toilets/sinks, thin walls, and creaky, very steep stairs (no elevators).  
Any grievances were redeemed by that great breakfast but if you're spending the kind of money we did, you might want to weigh your options carefully.
",3,2007,09,18
216,Great Hospitality near St. Stephens Green,"We arrived in Dublin on September 6 after an overnight flight from San Francisco.  Upon arriving at Number 31, we were greeted, immediately offered tea, coffee and breads to relax as our room was being readied, early for us.

Anne was most helpful with directions and suggestions for our first day in Dublin and our first trip to Ireland.  A very, very comfortable bed and quiet made our first night restful.  

The breakfast that was served the next morning was wonderful ( or in local jargon, brilliant).  I can wholehartly recommend the scrambled eggs and salmon.  We had fruits and yogurt to start before you get about five suggestions for your cooked to order breakfast.

The hospitality and warmth extended by Anne, Noel and the staff makes you feel you have a home in Dublin.

We stayed two nights and will return in the future -

216,An oasis in the middle of Dublin....it's an Irish Riad!,"Arriving at Number 31 is like entering a different world, the stress of Dublin traffic eases away. Our car was parked for us, our luggage carried inside, and we relaxed with tea and biscuits while the check-in was organised somewhere behind the scenes. Where do you have to go these days to find such a service?

The place is full of character, it is welcoming, professional, unusual, personal, and it is fun. Like Dublin, really. The people at Number 31 talk to you, and its not about money or breakfast times.

The rooms are lovely, crisp bedlinen, warm colours, tranquil. The bathroom was super, brand new and tastefully designed. 
Number 31 is like an oasis in the middle of Dublin with its buzzing life, it's an Irish Riad!

And it has been like this the last time we went there, and doubtless it will the same next time.
",5,2007,09,07
216,THINK TWICE!!,"What the elegant website does not tell you is that four rooms are in a half-basement converted garage/mews.  Ours - Room 12 - is ideal if you appreciate: sleeping in a converted corridor; plumbing that doesn't work; a bathroom that has no windows and no ventilation and breaches health and safety standards; listening to the conversations - and other activities - of people in the room next door; looking at a half-painted ceiling; being woken by workers walking across the floor of the kitchen above; having no mirror, wastebin, etc; having a room uncleaned before you check in; being invited to pay 240 Euros/$ for this appalling hovel.  A good breakfast is no compensation for a ruined stay.  Make no mistake, this is a exploitative cash-factory masquerading as a 'boutique B&B'.  We were taken in - we hope others will think twice before they are.
",1,2007,08,29
216,Friendly service in a luxurious setting,"Number 31 is a beautiful boutique hotel with exquisite rooms. Our double bed was enormous and the pillows, mattress, etc. were supremely comfy.  The bathroom was also gorgeous with a huge walk in shower. Just walking around the room was delightful due to the thick pile on the carpet. Nothing was too much trouble for the staff who did everything they could to help us recover luggage lost by our airline.
The breakfast was delicious with a feast of choices using local organic produce. The hotel's location is excellent, just 10 minutes walk through the park and you are in the heart of the city.
It's expensive, but worth it.
",5,2007,08,19
216,Loved Number 31!,"We spent 4 nights at Number 31 in July, 2007 and it was our favorite hotel stay in Ireland.  Truly an oasis in the middle of bustling Dublin, Number 31 was both personal and top notch.  The rooms in the Georgian building have recently been re-done and we thought they were lovely.  Beds and linens were superb, and the new bathroom and shower were excellent.  Our room was very spacious (#22) and quiet.  The flat screen TV was a nice touch, along with the DVD player.  The staff has a small selection of films that guests may borrow.  The breakfast at Number 31 was a stand-out...absolutely delicious.  We also loved the location...just a 5 minute walk from St. Stephen's Green.  But the biggest asset at Number 31 is its host and staff.  The owner, Noel Comer, is welcoming, engaging and very helpful...he was the best!  We also appreciated the entire staff.  They were professional and helpful at every turn.  I think it's important to remember that Number 31 is really a guesthouse, not a full scale hotel.  What I expect from a guesthouse is personal service and care, not necessarily all of the amenities one would find at a hotel.  While not inexpensive, we found Number 31 to be an exceptionally good value in heart of very pricey Dublin.  I highly recommend Number 31...it's a gem.
",5,2007,07,16
216,Exactly The Type of Place,"Number 31 was exactly the type of place we love to stay when we travel. Located near St. Stephens Green and a short walk to the city center, Number 31 served as a retreat. The personal and charming atmosphere complimented by the equally helpful, enthusiastic and knowledgeable staff served as a compass for our first experience in Ireland. Number 31's unique blend of architectural welcomed us each time we returned from our day's explorations. Breakfast for which Number 31 is known met all the rave reviews. Comfortable, welcoming, charming, delightful, perfect  is how we would describe Number 31 to anyone who likes to travel off the beaten path and yet be in the lap of luxury.
",5,2007,07,11
216,Nice weekend getaway,"Having just returned from a weekend stay in this hotel, I  must say I really enjoyed it. The beds are really as comfortable as they say, the interior of the room was tasteful minimalistic. And the shower .... !!
The breakfast was also as good as everybody said, and the owners made us feel very welcome. I must admit, that Number 31 is a little bit pricey, but I think it was worth its money.
",5,2007,07,09
216,Fodor Follies,"We stayed in two Dublin hotels that were highly recommended by Fodor's.  Both were greatly disappointing although for different reasons.

Number 31 has a lot going for it.  It is an architecturally interesting property in a convenient, quiet location.  The best thing about our two-night stay was, without a doubt, the fabulous breakfast.  Everything is the highest quality, from the muesli to the homemade breads the fruit and the cooked breakfasts.  The homemade marmalade is exceptional!

Also, the breakfast area itself is lovely and inviting - especially if you get to breakfast early and can get a seat in the sun-room.

Our room was quite small but nicely furnished with modern decor.  Beds were comfortable and had quality linens. The bathroom was very high-tech looking black marble with a great shower. 

On the negative side, and this is a HUGE negative, the room we stayed in was so noisy that it was difficult to sleep.  This was a real problem as this was the hotel we stayed at our first two nights when we were suffering from jet lag and general exhaustion.  Noise came from three sources: the room was close to the hotel entry so any time people arrived late at night, we heard them; the rooms don't have much soundproofing between them, so we heard people in the room next door; third (and worst) was the fact that the room was directly under the breakfast room so we heard loud footsteps from the time staff started preparing breakfast in the early am.  I used ear plugs but that didn't solve the problem.

Other rooms may be better but the downstairs room should be avoided if at all possible.  

Minor complaints were: no hair dryers, coffee/tea makers, printed hotel information, iron in the rooms.

Also, the hotel has a nice sitting area with a fireplace but we were the only ones who ever seemed to use it so, other than at breakfast, there was no opportunity to see or interact with other guests.  If the owners see this review, I would suggest having tea, coffee, or wine available in the evening.

Our room was very expensive (more than 200 Euro a night) and  definitely not worth the money, even with the fabulous breakfast and marmalade!

",2,2007,07,06
216,"Number 31; coldly modern, great breakfasts!","We stayed two nights at Number 31, a guesthouse in Dublin.  It is an interesting combination of very modern furnishings inside a Georgian townhouse.  The staff is friendly and the breakfasts are truly delicious.  The rooms are spacious but some small touches, like adequate lighting, tissue boxes, waste baskets were oddly absent.  A lot has been spent on the very modern interior decor and the room and bath were absolutely  fine but I found the combination of styles jarring and not too successful.  The location is ok, just south of St. Stephens park but a bit of a walk to the top Dublin sites.  We paid 240euros which I felt was a bit overpriced.
",4,2007,07,05
216,An incredible place to stay,"We stayed only one night in Dublin at No. 31, and it more than lived up to its advance billing.  

The room was beautifully appointed and a heavenly bed. Plus, it was cool that you could enter property from either the alleyway or from the street -- two totally different perspectives.  It made it seem like an oasis in the middle of a city.

The service and staff was top notch.  Afternoon coffee/tea by the fire hit the spot upon our arrival.  And, the breakfast next morning was absolutely delicious.  The dining area was relaxing and promoted easy conversation with our fellow guests.

We would definitely return to No. 31 -- truly memorable.",5,2007,06,15
216,Agree...Number 31 is wonderful!,"This is the perfect place to stay in Dublin.  

I cannot say that it is home from home as nobody gets such an excellent breakfast if they stay at our place!  

Everyone was very friendly and helpful, recommending good places to visit and restaurants to eat in.
",5,2007,06,08
216,absolutely wonderful,"We wanted to book somewhere special in Dublin for a weekend treat to celebrate a special 50th birthday (mine unfortunately but never mind!) and as it was our first visit to Dublin we were a bit unsure where to book. Consulted trip adviser and thought so many people can't be wrong about number 31. Booked a 2 night stay11th and 12th May and we were not disappointed. From the moment of our arrival we were absolutely wowed by the place - it was everything we were hoping
for and more. All the decoration and renovation mentioned in previous
reviews was completed and our room was gorgeous - everything new and luxurious. We couldn't fault anything, a very warm welcome, more than
helpful with advising where to visit, best restaurants etc and the best breakfast ever.  We did have a bit of a problem finding the place - in the rain unfortunately - and I would certainly make sure you get directions from the owners on how to get there from the aircoach drop off point but once we arrived a bit damp admittedly! we
were seated by the log fire and served coffee and home made cookies and then shown to our lovely room. A truly lovely place and we would certainly recommend it if you are looking for something a bit special.",5,2007,05,27
216,I didn't expect to find heaven in Dublin,"We found heaven in Dublin at Number 31 - bed and breakfast accommodation unlike anything else in Ireland that we experienced. Arriving tired and deflated from a previous experience, we were offered afternoon tea before we even arranged to stay there. The welcome was genuine and warm. As we sat by the fire we rejoiced in what we had found. Then we were taken to the most luxurious room, down-filled pillows and doona and exquisitely comfortable bed. Breakfast is an art form at No 31, very generous with the widest freshest range of choice experienced anywhere in our three week stay. 

As we reluctantly set off on our touring journey, the wonderful Noel sat with us and planned our trip with wise advice and good humour and we can thank him for making our holiday memorable. He explained the best places to go and why, spending over half an hour with us at a busy breakfast time. 

Nothing is trouble to Noel and Anne. We returned to Dublin to depart from Ireland and wanted to eat out on our last night but the room was so utterly everything you could hope for, we stayed in simply to enjoy it. Our best memories in Ireland are of No 31 and we travelled far and wide. It also eclipsed our experiences in Madrid and Paris - which is saying something. If anyone wants to be spoilt, to really relax and enjoy quality accommodation from lovely warm hosts, you cannot go past No. 31 and its hosts Noel and Anne.   Mind you, it is hard to leave. Vanessa and Peter Crimmins
",5,2007,05,18
216,Wonderful,"We loved our stay at Number 31! The hotel is really a cross between a hotel and a bread and breakfast. It is small and intimate and very friendly.

After a long flight, we arrived early in the morning. We were warmly welcomed and served breakfast while our room was being prepared. No problem about arriving hours too early! The breakfast alone is worth coming here! The standard Irish is always available, but also so many other choices. The breads and jams are all homemade,  as are the two types of granola. Bowls and bowls of fruit salads were available each day. I could keep going on...

The hotel was just finishing up refurbishement when we were there. The entance was being worked, but I am sure it will be lovely when finished. The rooms were magnificent! Our's had a seating area and then the bedroom. Feather beds with crisp linens and lots of down pillows invited sleep. The bathroom was all in marble and all new! Quite lovely. Everythng was spotless.

The two drawbacks to the hotel are that the evening staff, while very friendly and accomondating, did not know Dublin as well as the day staff. So, for specific questions about attractions, we needed to be sure to ask during the day. Also, our room did not have a tv, which we would have liked for morning news and weather. I forgot to ask, but I wouldn't be surprised if the tv's are coming as part of refurbishement. They were almost finished when I was there, but had a bit to go.

Overall, a wonderful stay. Close enough to walk to Grafton St, Trinity, Temple Bar, etc.. We also discovered a great night life right in this area. We would definitely go back.

216,"If you can afford it, this is a place to spend it!","We spent just one night at the beginning of a tour to Ireland.  We stayed on the 4th of April, and they were finishing up some of the cosmetic touches of their recent renovations.  
We were warmly greeted upon arrival and served tea and cookies.
Our room was beautifully modern, large and quiet.  When we arrived they had put out a nice bottle of wine in our room based on my wife’s request as a surprise for my birthday. 
 My wife loved the rainfall showerhead in the bathroom.  
Our bed was heavenly and the best that we slept on for the remainder of our 3 weeks in Europe. Breakfast set a standard not to be out done on the rest of our tour of Ireland. As a family with a number of food allergies, their handling of our dietary issues was top notch.
 If they have space available this is not an establishment to pass up.  Treat yourself to the best of Irish hospitality and you will not be disappointed.

216,Loved it loved it loved it!!!,"I first stayed in Number 31 about 5 years ago when visiting Dublin with my parents. It was a wonderful experience then and after my stay last weekend I can only say that it has only gotten better.  When I arrived I was greeted warmly offered tea and cake while they prepared my room. It was perfect after a long day of traveling. It only served to set a tone for the rest of my stay. The whole service was completely five star, from the fantastic staff to wonderful food to beautiful rooms. Mine on the second floor overlooking the garden was wonderful. The décor had changed completely since my last stay, but I loved it! Everything was simple and elegant but of only the highest quality from the linens to the beds to the fittings in the bathrooms – which are the nicest of any hotel I have ever stayed in!! Number 31, was a great experience and a fantastic base for exploring Dublin. I return again tomorrow if I could!!!!
",5,2007,04,20
216,Incredible incredible incredible!!!,"I was so shocked to read the previes review having just stayed at number 31 with my partner. I actually find it astonshing that someone could actually write such a review about this family run business.
Ill keep it short....but myself and my partner stayed here for three nights and on each one we were treated like royalty. This is NOT a large chain hotel, which i think the person in the previous review should stick to from here on in....this house has had a huge refurbishment recently as i was told by Noel, and and it is absolutly stunning. It oozes style and flare like no other place i have stayed before, and as an avid traveller, i know a bad hotel/guesthouse when i set foot in one!! the food and service was exceptional, gordon ramsey youve got competition  here....the breakfast was to die for.Noel and the staff, including ann and delia in the kitchen were so fantastic, and always looked after us so well. Anyone going to Dublin....this spot is the hot spot, its a MUST DO!!!! Utterly incredible!
",5,2007,04,19
216,Will Return,"I had stayed in Number 31 eight years ago and loved it, but I was a bit hesitant to return after reading some mixed review here in TripAdvisor.  Since most of these focused on the condition of the B&B, I decided to give it a chance because they had closed down for renovations and were re-opening just prior to our planned stay.

Our room was spacious and had new carpet, bed, bedding, and an entirely new and elegant bathroom with fluffy towels.  The lighting was a bit dim, and there was a bit of a gap between the top and bottom portions of the window, creating a draft and allowing street noise in (we were on the ground level).  We mentioned this and they did attempt to fill the gap the same day, which was appreciated.  

Unfortunately, the renovations were not quite complete and we had to contend with a fairly constant stream of noise from the hallway outside our room.  We also had to dodge welders and painters.  And, though no fault of the B&B management, there was street work going on directly outside our window that involved a jackhammer when we were in the room trying to rest. 

On the good-news end of things, the breakfasts were as fantastic as I remembered, and the staff was pleasant and helpful.  Noel was there helping to serve breakfast (another poster had mentioned his absence, but he was definitely around during our stay).  

And Number 31 still has that great location and is still a beautiful and unique place to stay.

Noel realized our stay was not as restful and pleasant as we had hoped (and especially at the new prices, which are a bit more than I remembered from years ago -- maybe that's the fault of the weak dollar).  He was quite generous in making up for this and I will definitely give Number 31 another try (after the renovations are complete).   So, although our stay was really not very pleasant, I'm giving this review 4 out of 5, because Noel appropriately addressed things, for which we were very grateful.

My advice to travelers --  give Number 31 a try once the renovations are done.  And ensure that you get a room that is not on the ground level, as you will hear noise from anyone going in or out of the B&B (we had to listen to an unhappy child for 30 minutes early one morning while his parents packed up).  I requested this, but did not in insist on it, and therefore in the future I would insist on it.  Also, the street noise can be a problem, though we were told they have heavy curtains on order that should help alleviate that.  At any rate, we would ask for a garden vs. street view in the future to avoid the street noise.

216,An OasIs of Auld Dublin Warmth and Hospitality - A treasure,"Without doubt the most hospitable guest house in Dublin located in the heart of the city.

The staff do Ireland proud ....

The most delicious breakfast in town with the nicest and most genuine staff I ve encountered ..
",5,2006,10,11
216,a warm welcome,"We were greeted on arrival by the very friendly Peter who, after showing us to our room, provided us with tea and cake in the sunken lounge area and gave us a quick guide to Dublin (v.helpful).
As other reviewers have already stated, the breakfasts are superb and a great start to the day. Home made granola, soda bread, fresh mixed berries with yoghurt, an amazing selection of cooked breakfasts all rustled up by the friendly staff. 
We stayed in the main house on the 3rd floor and our room was clean and cosy with lovely high ceilings and a very comfy bed with snuggly duvets and pillows. Plenty of tea/coffee/milk/ sparkling water and cleaned to a very high standard every day whilst we were eating breakfast.
Bathrooms are prefectaly adequate but I imagine will need a revamp soon if they are to avoid letting down the rest of the house.
Areas of this property are quite rustic but that seems to add to the charm. Location is also fab as close to evrything including airport bus stop. I would definitely recommend N31 if you are looking for something a bit quirky with a personal touch.

216,Great B&B,"Clean and very impressive building. Owner was a great host over breakfast. Location was fab ! Would stay again. Thanks.
",5,2006,09,21
216,"Missing Noel, Missing the Point","We decided to stay at Number 31 primarily because of the good things we had read about Noel Comer, his hospitality, and Homer, his dog.  Unfortunately, we were disappointed.  We stayed 4 days and actually saw the elusive Noel just once.  The night we arrived (admittedly later than expected due to diabolical Heathrow), we were met by John, who was less than welcoming.  Our rooms were large but shabby, poor bathroom with thin towels, badly lit, stuffy and hot with no way to open a window and peculiarly noisy plumbing.  The ""conversation pit"" for guests (made much of in advertising) was the pits.  Stuffing leaking out of the old leather sofas, an aura of down-at-heel neglect and badly in need of updating and redecoration.  We had bought a dog toy for Homer from Australia with us, and it wasn't even acknowledged - by Homer, or his owners.  On a positive note, the location is very good - close to St Stephen's Green and Grafton Street.  And the breakfasts were excellent and served by efficient and friendly staff.  It's just a pity that Noel has apparently decided to rest on his laurels.
",2,2006,09,13
216,Quirky,"Number 31 is a bit different. A mixture of 60s chic and Georgian splendour depending on which building you are in. The breakfast is amazing and location very good. It may not be for you however if you expect plasma TVs, power showers and aircon. 31 is unfussy and laid back.
",4,2006,09,12
216,many nice things about this place,"The staff is friendly and helpful. The food is very good. The design of the place is quirky and cool, including the cosy sunken living room with peat fire. We liked the other guests and even the big dog. The location is an easy walk to everything in Dublin. 

But, your enjoyment at this place might rely on which room you have. Between our children and us -- we had three rooms.

Our first room was in the front of the house - and at the basement level. It smelled strongly of mold, and there were no windows that opened more than a couple of inches. When we asked for another room however, they moved us. The room we moved to was upstairs, near the back of the kitchen - and was quite nice. There were funny things about the design of the place - our kids room off the lobby had no windows, but a large skylight. There room was noisy early from the dining room above it. I can see how the room off the dining room would be really noisy.

I would go back again and ask for the upstairs room. I think they call it the Honeymoon Suite! The people were so nice  - and the location was perfect.
",4,2006,08,30
216,watch out for room 45,"This room opens directly into the dining area, so there is no chance of a lie in!! The resident dog starts whining and barking about 0700 as breakfast is prepared. This accompanied by the clatering of plates and those having breakfast as soon as it starts means you will not be able to sleep in, to make breakfast at 1000 for example.
",2,2006,08,28
216,Friendly but not a 'boutique hotel',"We booked this hotel for a two night stay in Dublin largely on the feedback from Trip Advisor and my Eyewitness Travel Guide which described Number 31 ""Reputedly the most stylish guesthouse in the city ... more of a boutique hotel than a B+B"".

However, it is definitely more B+B than boutique hotel. 

On the positive side the staff are fantastic, they park your car, give you directions and advice and are very friendly indeed. The breakfast (from a food point-of-view) is delicious.  The peat burning fire in the morning is great - I love that smell.  Also the location is good - a five minute walk to St Stephens Green where Grafton Street starts.

On the negative side both reception and the Georgian house accomodation is very worn and dilapidated.  The carpets on the stairs are worn through and in our room alone the tap, bath panel and hanging hooks were broken.  The room was small and a bit shabby.  The room was hot at night so we had to keep the window open and Fitzwilliam Street which the rooms look onto is a busy road.

If we had paid £70-£80 a night for a double room we would have been happy but it was nearly double this.
",3,2006,08,13
216,"great breakfast, but...","Agreed, the breakfasts are great, staff friendly, but there is more to a hotel stay...we booked a ""superior"" room, but got no more than an ""okay"" room, charming but a bit pokey, with plastic wrap stuffed around the shower head as spackle...due to the hotel being booked, we moved to the much, much better situated Davenport - at a  much lower price (21 way overpriced readers!)
And the staff there very nice too!
",2,2006,07,23
216,Felt like home,"From the moment we arrived at Number 31, it felt like home. My husband and I, our three daughters and my parents  arrived at Number 31 in the morning after an all night flight from California . We  were warmly greeted by Linda who had warm cranberry bread, tea, hand pressed coffee and fresh squeezed orange juice waiting for  us. She gave us an orientation to Dublin and allowed us to check into our rooms early so that we could revive ourselves for the full day ahead. 

Our rooms were beautiful. Each of the three rooms we used were tastefully decorated, had extremely comfortable beds and included every amenity we could possibly need. They were wonderful retreats after very full days of exploring Dublin! And the breakfasts...to die for!

Staff was always so welcoming and accomodating. Computer use, arranging for taxis, directions, recommendations, you name it and they were there for you. We would return to Number 31 in a minute, it was everything good about Ireland!
",5,2006,07,19
216,Best of both worlds,"We absolutely loved Number 31. It was our first time in Ireland and I'm so glad we chose Number 31 as our first place to stay. The staff could not possibly be friendlier or more accommodating, the food was spectacular, and the location just a short walk from St. Stephen's Green was perfect. For us, the style of Number 31 was ideal – the bed-and-breakfast aspects let us immediately get a flavor of Ireland's charming and friendly people, while our room (with private bathroom) gave us a private retreat. The surrounding area, with Georgian mansions as far as the eye can see, and many of Dublin's main attractions, including Grafton St, St. Stephen's, and Trinity College all within easy walking distance, was ideal. 

Our large ""en suite"" room had high ceilings and a lovely view of Fitzwilliam Place and, as I mentioned, its own private bathroom. The room was large, clean, charming and comfortable and felt more like home than anywhere else we stayed in Ireland. The breakfasts, served country style at large tables (including one glorious one out on the patio), were delicious and made to order. Being a lover of fish I had salmon one day and kippers the next. The hearty breakfasts were perfect for starting our big days of sightseeing. The brown bread is also spectacular. 

But any hotel is only as good as the people and that's what made Number 31 special for us. Everybody was friendly and kind, but also went out of their way to help us during a minor emergency. Anne, especially, is someone we'll always treasure. And we'll also remember Frances, and, of course, Homer! 

Stay at Number 31. You'll be glad you did.

216,The Highest Praise for Number 31,"I just returned from a four night stay at Number 31 and would return there in a heartbeat.  I arrived after an exhausting day of travel from California to Dublin and from the very first contact the staff was completely solicitous and welcoming.  Anne, the manager, carried my and my companion's bags in, parked our car for us, and served us a much-needed pot of tea in the sunken livingroom.  

We stayed in a very spacious, quiet room in the Georgian styled building across from the main building.   The bed linens and towels were of very high quality, so I was surprised at a previous review that complained about the towels.  The shower was very hot and powerful.  The only issue with the shower in that room was that the glass shower wall didn't prevent water from getting on the floor--a potential hazard that we remedied by putting an extra towel down.  We moved to a smaller room next to the breakfast room for our second two nights, which was also quite comfortable.  The breakfasts were, as described, delicious, particularly the smoked salmon and eggs and the fresh fruit, granola and yogurt.  

All of our contact with the staff was positive, and Anne, in particular, took care of every need that arose: calling the theater to reserve tickets, making reservations at a local restaurant, even writing out a map and directions to get back to the airport.   Thanks to the entire staff at Number 31 for a relaxing and rejuvenating first visit to Dublin!
",5,2006,07,18
216,Architecture and breakfasts to die for,"We stayed for 5 nights and it made us feel like we'd found a haven in the middle of the city. Breakfasts were excellent (home-made bread and marmalade etc - lots of fruits too).
The service was all we could ask for - very attentive and friendly. The waitress team were locals so were happy to give advice and directions on places to see.
And we mustn't forget the architecture; it really made the holiday for us. This one B&B gave us a Georgian house to sleep in (although 4 flights of stairs to walk up as we were on the top floor) with the 1950s modernist house to eat breakfast and relax in the lounge.
Our only comment is that the front of the Georgian House is onto a busy road and so was noisy if we had the windows open. Otherwise: our beds were comfy, linen and towels were good.
We're intending to go to Dublin to stay at Number 31 again.
",5,2006,07,15
216,Very disappointed with our stay at Number 31,"Overall, I was very disappointed with the Number 31.  

We never tried a bed and breakfast before, and we thought it would be fun to try out for the 1st time on our trip to Dublin.  We looked at the website, and the place looked great.  It seemed to get very good reviews.  

We arrived, and we were shown to our rooms.  The room looked pretty tired, but with it being a b&b, I figured it wouldn't necessarily have the 5-star look.  On top of that, it was very hot in the room, and it faced a busy street, so we were hearing cars drive by all night. 

Moving on, my wife wakes up the next morning and showers.  Right in the middle of the shower, the water is completely cut off.  I call down to the front desk, and explain what happened.  I get no apology or anything, they just simply say ""we will look into it.""  1/2 hour later, we plug our battery charger into the wall to recharge our batteries for our digital camera.  Upon putting in the adapter into the socket, it nearly blows a fuse.  Not good!  I then also check to see if the water is working.  It is still turned off.  Visibly frustated, I call down to explain our fuse, and also express my disappointment that the water is not fixed.  The response I get was ""Sir, it appears you are not happy here, we may suggest you find another hotel to stay at"".  No apologies or attempt to try and remedy the situation.  I cannot tell you how appalled I was.  But since we were on a very tight schedule, I just didn't have the time or the patience to deal with a hotel switch.  I requested that they make every effort to get the water problem fixed.

The next morning I requested a wake up call at 7:30, they forgot to call.  Luckily I woke up at 7:45 on my own!   I got into the shower.  Within 1 minute, you guessed it, the water cut off again.  I called down there, explaining what happened again.  At that point, they offered to move us to a new room.  This was fine, but I had felt they had very little empathy for our situation.  Adding insult to injury, they were charging us a bundle to stay there.  Unacceptable!  I will mention that they did a nice job of taking ownership on the situation this time.  They moved us to a new room, and it was much nicer, bigger, updated and quieter.  They also comped me 1 night (This is after I requested that we get some type of comp or refund for what we went through)

I don't mean to sound so negative, I am very easy to please.  But when you encounter so many different problems, very little is being done to try and fix it, it can get very frustrating.

On the positive side, the breakfast was very good.  I will also mention that the morning we left, they called us at around 7:30 to see if we would like to eat breakfast early, as we had to leave for the airport (breakfast is normally served at 8), so that was very considerate of them.

The location of the place is about at 15 minute walk to City Centre.
",2,2006,07,14
216,"Poor value, but great breakfast","Quite frankly I was disappointed, given that it came highly recommended by friends.

This is not a hotel, it's an upmarket B&B. Unfortunately it charges 4* hotel prices and doesn't have hotel facilities. Dublin is not cheap anyway but this was not value for money, it is expensive for an average size room.

I suspect we didn't get one of the better rooms that I've seen in the photo's on this site, even though we booked months in advance.

We came on a very hot weekend and the rooms on the upper floors were stifling. Where  our room faced the main road it suffered from road noise (we needed the windows open!) and people in the offices opposite could see into our room! Our friends room one floor higher was even hotter. 

The place was spotless, the bathroom has seen better days but the shower was hot and powerful. The towels had seen better days and felt like cardboard.

The breakfasts were fantastic and service was very attentive.

Location is great for getting in the city centre.
",2,2006,07,08
216,Good value,"Number 31 was worth the money.  My room in the Georgian wing was spacious and light.  The noise from late-night louts was noticable on only one night in a six night stay.  The only improvement I could suggest is the inclusion of a clock.  The staff were absolutely delightful and helpful.  They repeatedly let me use the computer in their office to check my e-mail.  Their immediate warm welcome when I turned up several hours early at 6.30 a.m. was impressive.  They insisted that I sit down to breakfast despite the fact that I should not have received it that day.  The quality of the food was absolutely top drawer, particularly the fruit.  One particularly attractive quality of this B&B was the long breakfast tables which gave breakfast a communal feel and allowed one to meet other guests.
",4,2006,07,04
216,What's hot? Not Number 31!,"Not what we expected for the money. The bedroom was clean and the bed was comfy, but the bathroom smelled like it had an unvented sewer pipe; hence the closed door when we entered the room. The food and wait staff where above par. It was nice to have a dog around even though he barked each morning at 6:30. Shop around, there has got to be a better deal closer to city center.
",2,2006,06,27
216,Refreshing!,"My girlfriend and I stayed for 2 nights and had a very pleasant stay. The breakfast was excellent and the staff was very helpful and assisted with our Dublin sight-seeing. I really appreciated the hotel's offbeat and funky style as it's a nice departure from the norm. I'd recommend number 31 to anyone who prefers a place with a tad more style then the run-of-the-mill bed and breakfast (of which there are many in Ireland!).
",5,2006,06,10
216,"Great location, great stay!","My wife and I stayed at Number 31 May 25-27, in the upper level of the coach house. We had already been in Ireland for a week, but recalling how I felt after flying over from the States I would have loved the welcome we received even more. Tea, coffee, and cranberry bread in from of the fireplace while relaxing and getting travel tips...

Our room was absolutely wonderful, comfy bed and a view of the courtyard. The breakfasts are outstanding...I am officially addicted to rashers.

Two small problems, one completely out of the control of the management. While the location is great for seeing Dublin, on the weekends the street Number 31 is on becomes quite the clubbing scene. Quite noisy outside the Friday night we were there.

The other issue was actually with the location of our room. It was right next to the office/kitchen, and while we could tell an effort was made to keep quiet, we could usually hear the phone ringing and any conversation above a whisper. Added to this was the fact that in order to get water pressure to the bathroom some kind of pump (that was quite noisy) went into operation, making any use of water a noisy operation.

Do not let this keep you from staying here...(for one thing I am a notoriously light sleeper). We would stay again in a heartbeat, although we would probably try to get a room across the way in the townhouse portion.
",5,2006,06,02
216,Very Nice Boutique guest house,"We stayed at No 31 for one night, I chose it because of the reviews on this website and on the No 31 website; it sounded 'different' ... and it was.

While there is a little 'shabbiness' in some parts I don't think that detracts from the comfort of the place and it adds to its character ""shabby chic"".  The lounge and breakfast room in the mews section of the place is very 60s and very different to anywhere I've ever stayed.  The Georgian townhouse is splendid, with high ceilings and wide staricases.  The bedroom we had looked as though it had recently been refurbished and was elegantly decorated in contemporary neutrals.  As someone else mentioned in their review it was more like staying in a friends guest room than a B&B.

The breakfast was good, the best out of everywhere we had stayed on our week driving hoiday (and that included the 5 star Hayfeild Manor in Cork, where the only additional benefit was a complementary glass of bubbly). 

The only slight negative was our room was very small, I would have loved to see some of the other rooms to compare.  As for the peat smell in the lounge I thought it was great; despite it being May the weather was appalling and to be greated by a real fire was lovely.
Would definitely stay again... maybe ask for a bigger room though.
",4,2006,05,26
216,"Authentic Experience, Great location!","If B&B's with all their quirks and charms are your thing - then I can highly recommend Number 31.  The Georgian House gives a real authentic flavor - after seeing how the Georgian Architecture dominates the city - it was lovely to go ""home"" to see what lies behind the brick facades.  The bed was very comfortable the bathroom and room were extremely clean (and spacious if you have a delux accomodation).  The breakfast lives up to all the rave reviews.  The staff were extremely friendly and helpful.  

Next to the breakfast and the comfy bed, the location of Number 31 is the B&B's best feature.  It is only two short blocks away from the airport coach service and a five minutes stroll to St. Stephen's green.  Going in the opposite direction away from St. Stephen's Green is the Georgian House Museum -which is a lovely way to spend an hour seeing how life was lived during the reign of the Georges.  

There are only two small detractors to Number 31, neither of which would prevent me from returning for another visit.   I only mention them, so that people will not go and be disappointed.  First,  the TV in the room was tiny (but who goes to Ireland to watch TV, right?) and the smell in the lobby (the lobby features a very cool sunken couch and fireplace) took a bit to get used to.  It is actually just the smoke from the old fireplace, but it is quite musty.  If you request a room in the Georgian House (the main house) vs. the carriage house (where the lobby is) then you can avoid this unique oder altogether.  

I look forward to returning to Dublin and to Number 31!
",4,2006,05,25
216,Not as good as last year,"I stayed in this hotel twice.  Once in March of 2005 & then again in April 2006.  I really loved it in 2005 - and I have to stay that I liked it better the first time around.

Not that it has changed all that much - but the service wasn't as good, but it wasn't terrible.  (There were a few messages we missed - which was the biggest problem) And, one reason I like to travel is to experience new people.  If you like staying with Americans - this is good place to stay, but I kind of felt like I was staying with my retired mom and all her friends.  Not exactly what I was looking for, but not all that bad either.
",3,2006,05,20
216,Loved Number 31,"We recently stayed at Number 31 and would highly recommend it more to anyone visiting Dublin.  The value for the money is excellent ( and the US dollar continues to sink).  Besides the great safe location.......the staff, breakfasts and guest rooms are all fabulous!  

It was also fun meeting interesting people from all over the world at breakfast.  The owner and his staff went out of their way to give us travel tips around the area and directions. 

We will be recommending Number 31 to all our friends planning a trip to Dublin.
",5,2006,05,17
216,A great place to stay,"We stayed at Number 31 for 2 nights last week and it suited us perfectly. It was very private - we were given a key to the front door when we arrived so that we could come and go as we pleased but also had the pleasant atmosphere where we could chat to other guests at breakfast and hear about their travel experiences.

Our room was in the Georgian part of the hotel and we had a lovely big bed with crisp fresh linen sheets and a good sized bathroom. I loved the little cobbled path that joins the Georgian house to the Coach house which we could see from our bathroom window. My favourite part of the stay had to be the breakfast though. There were big bowls of fresh summer fruits and fruit salad and as other reviewers have mentioned the cranberry bread was wonderful as was the home made marmalade - I wish I'd asked if I could buy some to take home with me. Fresh toast was plentiful and there was a choice of different main breakfasts ranging from a full irish to a fantastic cheese omlette. The orange juice was freshly squeezed as well. We felt totally indulged and breakfast kept us going until late afternoon. 

As other people have mentioned its a short walk into the heart of Dublin but as this involves a leisurely stroll through beautiful St Stephens Green it was something of a treat rather than a chore. The aircoach to the airport goes from very near to the hotel as well - leaving every 15 minutes and costing just 12 euros for a return and taking only a few minutes longer than the taxi but at a fraction of the cost. 

If you want all the trappings of a luxury hotel with  room service and a mini bar then this probably isn't the hotel for you but if you want to feel as if you've been invited to stay with friends of the family in a beautiful Georgian townhouse and be spoilt with an amazing breakfast then I wouldn't hesitate to recommend Number 31.
",5,2006,05,13
216,Less than we expected,"After reading the many excellent reviews of Number 31 Guesthouse, my wife and I were CONVINCED that we would have a pleasant and unique experience. Don't get me wrong, this place is very different than most hotels in Dublin, but it is not OVER THE TOP fabulous as some claim. Before booking, here's what we feel you should know:
1. The location is NOT in the heart of Dublin, although it is not far, it is indeed in a quiet area south of St. Stephen's Green - about a 15 minute walk to Grafton Area/Trinitity College and about 25 minutes walking to Temple Bar.
2. If you book a standard room - be ready to sleep in a small double bed and not have too much space for anything else. 
3. Some improvements needed - carpet is worn, tiles are falling off in the tub/shower area, etc. For the rates they are charging, I think they could afford to upgrade some of the areas that are in need of work.
4. The staff is very friendly, but you have to seek them out since the guesthouse is really in three different buildings - we spent very little time in the common area since there was really no point (no one was ever there).
5. Breakfast is good, not amazing. Fresh berries, boxed cereals, bread and a selection of cooked eggs are about the extent. It kept us satisfied until mid-afternoon. 

Overall - it is 3 1/2* acoomodations - not 5* as some claim. I admit, sometimes we are hard to impress, but after staying in Dingle, Kenmare and Kilkenny (most for less than No. 31) - we wished our expectations were met in Dublin.

216,Comfy but what was that smell?,"We stayed in the Georgian house for six nights. Our room was very large and the bathroom was clean and enormous by typical European inn standards. The ambiance overall was welcoming. The location was excellent -- a short walk through St. Stephen's Green every day enabled us to burn some of the breakfast calories off. 

My only complaint was the stench of the common room in the main house -- was it pipe tobacco residue? chimney backflow? Whatever it was, it made me hold my breath whenever I walked in there. If I ever return to Dublin, I will stay at Number 31 but will be sure to request another room in the Georgian house.

216,Jewel in Dublin,"Number 31 is a jewel in Dublin.  Our group of 5 seniors arrived just after 5:30 in the morning and were greeted warmly and served tea.  After settling in a short while later, we were served the most delicious breakfast and offered practical ideas about touring the city (walking and busing).  The rooms here are large and very pretty and the staff is knowledgeable and friendly.  Breakfasts are feasts!  There aren't enough glowing adjectives to describe this place.
",5,2006,04,17
216,We love you Homer!,"My husband and I stayed at Number 31 for 3 nights (Mar 26th-28th). It's a wonderful cosy hideaway in the city. We stayed in the basement of the coach house. Our room was clean and welcoming and the bed was very comfortable 

The breakfasts are great (especially the cranberry bread). Our hosts were very friendly (escpecially Homer the dog.)

Number 31 is very convienient for a walking tour of the city. We walked through nearby St. Stephen's Green each day, and caught the Hop on Hop Off tourbuses around the city, which are a great way to get around.

We read the reviews on tripadvisor before leaving and were just a little concerned because a couple of them said they were disappointed. I think those people were probably excpecting ""luxury"" rather than ""cosy, b&b"" style. Sure, the decor's a little rough around the edges, but that gives it character. Number 31 is a lovely place to stay and we will definately be back!!!
",5,2006,04,09
216,Great find!,"My husband and I stayed at Number 31 and loved it. Anne greeted us after an early morning flight and served us breakfast long after breakfast hours were over.  The breakfast is not to be missed.  The homemade cranberry bread is wonderful and the fresh fruits, homeade jams were fabulous.  

The room was perfect and had lovely sheets and the bed was quite a haven after a long day of walking throughout Dublin.

Number 31 is tucked away from the noise of Dublin and is the perfect place to stay out of the way yet within walking distance to all the major attractions.
",5,2006,03,27
216,What a find,"Number 31 was tucked in a little close about 15 minute walk from the main centre of Dublin.
Behind the front door was a little courtyard garden leading to the main coach house. 
We were welcomed into the very grand living room area where there was an open fire and sunken seating area.  It had a lovely rustic, homely feel and the staff were so friendly and helpful.  We were offered tea and coffee and homemade cake on arrival which was much needed after our journey.

Breakfast was fantastic, room was beautiful, very tastefully decorated.

Would thoroughly recommend Room 31.
",4,2006,03,01
216,Great place,"Having been fortunate to stay at most of Dublins 5 star hotels on business, I wanted to try something different for a short break with my partner. Having spent 2 fantastic nights at Number 31, I will certainly be returning there should a trip to Dublin be on the cards. The Welcome, atmosphere and attitude of Anne and the team was refreshing and extremely appreciated. The Room was large, huge bed comfortable and home cooked breakfasts were fantastic. Although no eveing dinner is provided this allowed us to sample some of Dublins finest restaurants. Namely, The Unicorn & Shanahans on the green.

Number 31, 10 out of 10, highly recomended.

216,tranquility and heavenly,"The welcome was wonderful, the food fantastic, the rooms luxury with a 6ft wide bed! The staff happy, friendly and of course open fires, Homer the dog and Dublin on the doorstep. Who could ask for more.

216,Go for funky and friendly,"If you want a unique experience, within walking distance to most Dublin attractions then Number 31 is for you. Fabulous gourmet breakfasts, mega-friendly staff, cozy duvets, lovely oversized tubs, and attractive gardens are just part of the attraction. If you are the type who likes to interact with diverse and interesting people then you will return to Number 31 every time you are in Dublin!",5,2006,01,23
216,A Home away from Home in Dublin,"We were welcomed at 7:00 am [ a courtesy because of our early arrival on the red-eye from New York] with a warm pot of tea , a hot breakfast and time for a nap. Everything thereafter gave us the sense of being at home. Friendly advice from Anne about where to go and what to see. Even Homer the dog welcomed us. Preferably , ask for a high-ceilinged room in the Georgian wing. 
And do not miss the home-made preserves offered at the sumptuous daily Irish breakfast at the family-style tables in the breakfast room.
",5,2006,01,22
216,"Warm ,peaceful interlude","After an all night plane trip,my husband and I arrived at Number 31 bleary-eyed. We were welcomed with a peat fire ,a steaming pot of tea and warm cranberry bread. This was even before we checked-on ! Needless to say,it was a grand beginning to our 4 day New Year's lark. After walking across the intimate courtyard,Noel(the innkeeper extraordinaire), opened the door to this beautiful Georgian house where our room was located. Fireplace,lovely linens,carved molding, and the best shower in Ireland was awaiting  the weary travellers.  Number 31 is a very short walk to St. Stephen's Greene,a serene park where the hop-on and hop-off bus lines are located,Grafton Street,Trinity College,Dublin Castle,the Temple Bar area and Christ Church and St. Patrick's Cathedrals.A myriad of restaurants also abound in the area. We especially enjoyed Peploe's on  St. Stephen's Greene. Who could ask for anything more ?!? We are both looking forward to returning to Number 31 before year's end . It will be 
 like coming home !

216,A Dublin Gem,"Number 31 was the perfect place to stay on my recent trip to Dublin.  My boyfriend and I were curious when our taxi pulled up in front of a closed gate on a small, dark street after we arrived from the airport.  However, we were quickly greeted and welcomed to the hotel.  Number 31 is a gem.  The hotel is comprised of two townhouses - the main building is the former home of an architect and the townhouse where we stayed was just behind it, on the other side of a charming garden.  The main townhouse has a funky but sophisticated late 1960s/early 1970s aesthetic, with a very cool and welcoming sunken living room and fireplace.  We were offered coffee and dessert in the sunken living room as soon as we arrived.  Our room was beautiful - essentially a room in a mansion - very high ceilings and huge floor-to-ceiling windows; all with beautiful original detailing.  The bathroon was basic but very nice.

Morning greeted us with an abundant breakfast in the warm and welcoming dining room and garden (complete with a friendly dog).  We had a choice of sitting at one of a few communal tables, either inside or outside in a garden.  After our first breakfast at Number 31, we looked forward to breakfast everyday.  It was truly heavanly.  Among several choices was the Irish breakfast, with perfectly cooked eggs, Irish bacon and sausage, creamy potatos and toast. We also sampled the delicious smoked salmon and scrambled eggs.  Number 31 makes a yummy cranberry bread which is also part of your breakfast, along with individual French press coffee or individual pots of tea - absolutely perfect!  The company was warm and friendly - you sit with others, B&B style.

I would highly recommend Number 31 if you are looking for a charming inn/B&B experience in Dublin.  It has a great location - just a few blocks from St. Stephen's Green, and the hotel staff is friendly and warm.  I have stayed in hotels all over the world, and Number 31 was one of the most memorable.  We had a terrific experience.",5,2006,01,16
216,FABULOUS,"So very gracious, helpful instructions and directions, the BEST breakfast and lodging we had the entire 2 weeks we were in Ireland.  Would go tomorrow if I could.
",5,2005,12,12
216,"Hospitality, Charm  but not bland modern chain","I too was a little concerned about a couple of the reviews, but we had a fantastic B&B experience. The hospitality and breakfast are not over rated. They are as good as you'll encounter worldwide. As the entertaining proprietor admitted, it does need a big investment to update some of the facilities but that is also part of its charm. We had a beautifully decorated room. The reception area and dining area are also delightful. The location is also good for museums and a pleasant walk to Temple Bar.
Don't go if you want a formulaic modern chain hotel experience, but if you enjoy getting to know local people who rightfully take pride in their unique style of hospitality then give it a go. There will be many repeat visitors there too.

216,"Classy, elegant, and very comfy!!","This is our second stay in this charming Georgian rowhouse within walking distance to St Stephen's and downtown. In 1999, we were here for the Dublin marathon, and it was perfectly placed for the start/finish area (Connell Street) and the 9 mile marker!!! Noel and Deidra Comer, proprietors, provide a warm, friendly B&B with charm and elegance. The rooms are quite nice, with the most luxurious linens and towels. The beds are super cozy, and the bathrooms and sitting areas always clean and fresh. By the way, the breakfast is the closest thing to gourmet!! Fresh berries and mixed fruit, and a wonderful ""full Irish"", any way you prefer. Anne, the general manager, will attend to any need, and is a good source for all that is Dublin!! You will leave relaxed, refreshed, and with wonderful new friends. This is a place where we will make our ""home"" on future visits.

216,This place is an oasis,"I have stayed at Number 31 on many occasions over a period of many years.  I visit Dublin for business meetings and I always try to stay at Number 31.  It is located in a pleasant part of Dublin; it is different to other guest houses, bed & breakfasts and hotels and has a special ambience, atmosphere of calm, warmth and friendliness about it which you will not get elsewhere.  The rooms are extremely comfortable and the crisp linen of the beds is a pleasure to sink into.  You will not get a better breakfast in Dublin and the staff could not be more friendly or helpful; I have shared many a breakfast table with tourists at Number 31 and seen the special welcome which Noel, Anne, Aisling, Delia and their crew afford to visitors to Dublin (they work wonders for the Irish Tourist Board!).  On one occasion recently Number 31 was unfortunately full and I had to stay at a nearby hotel; it was twice the price and came nowhere near the comfort level.  Number 31 is simply a wonderful oasis and I strongly recommend it.

216,A great experience in the centre of Dublin,"A very interesting venue, we stayed in a lovely bedroom, ate magnificent breakfasts and attended by very pleasant staff. And ideally situated for walking the sights of Dublin. Strongly recommended.
",5,2005,11,16
216,Luxurious Georgian with great breakfast,"I loved the entire layout  with the courtyard connecting the two buildings. I Stayed in #19 which faced the courtyard and it was luxurious and peacefull. The antique furniture and accesiories were truly superior. Ceiling height of at least 12 feet gave it a spacious feel. Great Irish breakfast and then some. Service was efficient and kind. I particularly liked the morning breakfast in the solarium. Our host, Noel and his entourage, were most entertaining nad helpfull. I'd definetly return to these gracious digs and extend my stay the next time around. In a word, the place was ""brilliant"".
",5,2005,11,15
216,Terrible. Avoid this hotel. Expensive. Run Down. Rude Staff,"The price was one of the highest in Dublin for a basement room with a small 1/2 window high up- the view? out in to an alleyway! Breakfast crowd wakes you up if the staff didn't already... very strange place. Fireplace made the place choke with smoke... broken bath fixtures... just really run down place. Avoid.

216,Couldn't imagine staying anywhere else,"2005 marks my third year in a row staying at the highly acclaimed Number 31 Guest House.  Not only have I looked forward to it more and more each year, Number 31 has NEVER dissapointed.  My father and I travel regularly to participate in the Dublin Marathon.  We make our reservations with Number 31 on the day of our departure for the next year's marathon.  

I've stayed in both the Georgian House and the Coach House. Both are superb.  I would have to say I prefer the Georgian House for its tasteful decoration and stunning ambiance.  I can't say enough about the breakfast.  It is the best I have ever tasted.  The  homemade cranberry and brown bread is to die for.  The only complaint I would have to say about Number 31 is that they contributed to my ten pound weight gain at the end of my trip!  Anne is the lovely woman who runs the B$B on a daily basis.  Talk about Irish charm.  You couldn't ask for a more perfect host.

I would just like to say one thing before I end my review.  This is a bed and breakfast.  It is not a large chain motel.  You will not get room service at 2am and there is NO BAR.  I am amazed at how many people think a B&B should have a bar!  To stay at Number 31 is an experience of a lifetime.  Stay yourself, with your significant other, or even with the children.  I promise it will be a vacation you will never forget.

216,Hated our stay here- would NEVER recommend it.,"Steer clear of over-hyped, over-priced, noisy hotel. Strange place. Rude staff.
",1,2005,10,30
216,Like being invited to stay with a friend,"Yes, Number 31 is expensive.  So is Dublin.  Very.  So in the case of Number 31, I found the cost worth it.  The welcome was warm after a long transatlantic flight and not a moment's hassle was given about checking in early.  Loose leaf tea, press coffee and baked goods were presented in the comfortable sunken lounge.  Our room was spacious and comfortable.  And yes, there was the amazing breakfast.  That is a joy you can discover for yourself.

This is not a traditional hotel with an obvious front, an obvious reception or obvious rules.  If you like a more structured hotel environment, then this may not be your best choice.  If you like a more relaxed approach, this is definitely a spot worth considering.

I would advise printing the map from the website so your taxi driver knows where to go.  It is hidden away which just adds to the charm.

216,Brilliant,"Our experience at Number 31 was very pleasant -- overall ""brilliant"".  The
location is excellent although difficult to find.  I suggest getting a detailed
map before driving there.  Nevertheless, we did find it and found the staff
to be more than kind, helpful, and friendly.  Our room was comfortable
and clean.  The breakfast was excellent.  The highlight for us, however,
was the very lovely people who work there and go there.

216,We love Number 31!,"We stay in Number 31 about three times a year as we have a son studying in the city.
We have stayed in both the mews and in the Georgian house ... I can't understand the previous comments about the furnishings!  Both houses are tastefully decorated, warm, spotlessly clean and comfortable.
But it's more than furniture that makes a good guest house ... it's the welcome you get when you arrive ... it's like coming home.
The first time we drove there we got hopelessly lost - we phoned Number 31 and were told to stay put ... they'd come and get us!!  
I've never experienced anything like the genuine consideration the staff have for their guests.
Our son is always invited for complimentary breakfast ... and he eats enough to get him through to the next visit - the food is great - all cooked to order and offers a very wide selection.
Obviously it just wasn't the place for the previous reviewers ... everyone had different tastes but for us, Number 31 can't be passed.
",5,2005,10,24
216,Very disappointed,"Oct 19 2005 Overpriced and over-hyped. Left after one night.  Worst accommodation on trip. Understaffed.  Think Fawlty Towers with one poor lady frantically racing around trying to answer phones, shift luggage, move cars, buzz people into the building. No real reception area. Dark, run down. Cuppa tea after drive from Galway - we gave up on that after 45 minutes.

Our bath had mold, no place to hang towels, no dresser, no luggage racks, dusty shades with holes in them and our bed was 24 inches from the wall. I talked to others in Georgian section who also complained of small rooms, and two couples who were also cutting their stay short d/t disappointment.

Our Room #45 was RIGHT outside the main breakfast/office area which is reached via steep steps ( saw several seniors nearly fall).  When we opened our room door we literally bumped into breakfast diners! A guest asked, ""Is THAT your room?""  They were as amazed as we were!  So we were awakened at 6 a.m. to clanking in the kitchen, phones, street noise.  Yes, breakfast is good and the staff are nice.  ( Shouldn't breakfast be good at $205US?)  Never met the owners.  We fled to the Westin which is first rate and only 50Euro more. Lonely Planet is usually right on - but not on this one.",2,2005,10,23
216,Absolutely the Worst,"This is the worst.  The worst in Dublin.  The worst in Ireland.  The worst in Europe and, yes, even the worst in the World.  Pretentious and overpriced I have never stayed anywhere as gruesome in over 20 years of travelling that has involved everything from exquisite luxury to basic hostels. 

I was fooled by their great promotion – it sounded a wonderful Georgian house with period furnishings in the historic heart of the city. And it charged accordingly. 

I specifically mentioned when I booked that I was interested in the Georgian period and this was why I had booked.  So when we turned up, and were shown to a dreadful room in ‘60s extension, with chain store furniture, I was rather disappointed to say the least.  The fact that the room had not been aired or heated, on a cold, wet spring evening, didn’t help and the painted breeze blocks were not my idea of decoration.  However I was told that a lot of people like them. 

Next day we got a room in the main part of the house, it had a bathroom built in a partitioned off part of the bedroom – it was shabby – but the bedroom was worse, I’ve seen better furniture in my local Oxfam charity shop.  Run down and way past its sell by date – this seems to appeal to some people but, as has been said often before, this is shabby.  Chic doesn’t belong in the same sentence, I struggle to include it in the same paragraph.  There’s antique and there’s second hand and there’s fit for the skip, clearly this was in the last category.

Breakfast was OK – but at the price, I’d have expected to eat caviar for a month.

On the second morning we’d had enough and I swallowed my pride and moved to the Morrison – modern, cool and ironically the antithesis of everything we’d been looking for.  It was faultless with beautiful rooms, great bathrooms, pleasant service and a super location from which to explore Georgian Dublin.  

I later met someone who’d also stayed in a dire hotel in Dublin, recommended by friends of the owners and given the best room – not surprisingly it was at No 31.  Not the room we had but it sounded about as memorably awful an experience.
",1,2005,10,20
216,somewhat helpful,"We arrived at Number 31 last weekend to check in, having made reservations.  The woman working there explained that due to a guest who'd fallen ill there was not a room available .  They had made a reservation at another B&B close by, and that worked out just fine.

Unfortunately, the next day friends were expecting to contact us at Number 31.  I alerted the woman whom we met, and she said it would be no problem, that she would forward them on.  The next day, when I didn't hear from my friends, I contacted Number 31 and they said that since they had ""no record"" of us they didn't know what to tell our friends, nor did they take a message (which would have helped me locate them).

Not the worst thing in the world, but surprising for a place so small.

216,TRUE hospitality,"We stayed in this hotel for 6 nights and been in two rooms. 
The rooms were LARGE by any standard and in other hotels would be considered as suites. The rooms and the hotel itself are VERY clean bright and pleasant. The staff is extremely helpful and seems to do that extra step one will never find in other establishments. Every question was answered every help possible was given. 
The first night we got a large room on the third floor, it had no elevator and we asked for a different room, got the other room on the first floor of the smaller house – again large room clean and pleasant. A REAL pleasure to come back after a day of city touring. 
 The breakfast is a real jumpstart. Full rich and one can choose from many options all homemade and quite delicious.
All in all a feeling of TRUE good hearted hospitality. 
The location is also very good. 5 minutes walk from the green. (with 3 nice pubs just around the corner on Lesson street) a minute from the canal and to most of the tourist hotspots of the southern part of Dublin such as Grafton street and temple bar.     

We HIGHLY recommend this hotel.

216,Classical Irish Treasure,"Number 31 Leeson is a step back into an era when hosting with total concern for the guest was the standard.  It is a unique experience that you will not forget.  You are greeted as a valued friend as if you were coming back for the second time.  Anne and her admirable staff were there to greet us the day of our arrival, took our bags, and served us the most delicious, homemade breakfast one could ask for.  We found the accomodations spacious, clean and comfortable.  Our every need was anticipated and cared for, as only an Irish host is capable of doing.  Number 31 is the best stop in Ireland.

216,Boutiful Breakfasts served w/Plentiful Smiles!,"We stayed here for 2 nights in June, though not consecutive nts.  Make sure you have the correct address and a good map b/c the one-way streets made the B&B difficult to find, even for our cab driver.  Once you arrive, central Dublin's St. Stephen's Green, Grafton St. shopping, and Temple Bar are a pleasant & easy 5-10 minute walk away.  The 1st nt, we stayed in a bottom floor room with patio of the main carriage house.  It was not what we expected.  The ""upgraded"" room was very basic and loud in the morning when people came in to eat breakfast overhead.  The tiny patio was overgrown w/a broken bench.  On the plus side, the hostess (the owners were away, but left fantastic people in charge!) and servers made us completely welcome at breakfast.  AND WHAT A BREAKFAST!!!!  Months later, I can still remember the homemade granola, jams, breads, etc.  The absolute best way to start any day!!!!!!  After a week of touring the Irish countryside, we came back for another nt before our plane left.  This time, we stayed in the Georgian home reached via a charming courtyard.  Our huge room w/fireplace was on the bottom floor by the front door facing Upper Fitzwilliam St.  This was the ""upgraded"" room I was looking for!  A complete treat replete w/long, heavy curtains, elegant furnishings and fantastic ceiling mouldings.  Ask for this house when booking!  From the memorable breakfasts and gracious hospitality to the funky sunken living room w/crackling fire, this B&B is not to be missed!
",5,2005,10,04
216,Mixed review,"No question the breakfasts here are sensational.  Generous portions, attractively presented, with breads and jams made in-house.  It's a great way to start the day. The staff work hard to make the breakfasts memorable, and it shows.

Upon our arrival, we were warmly welcomed by the host who gave us a nice pot of tea until our beds became available.  No complaints there.

BUT -- and it's a big BUT -- the Georgian house at the rear is a bit down-at-heel.  The walls in our room were a mysterious gray-brown shade; hot water in the taps was erratic.  I thought it was okay, but my wife was distressed by the lugubrious atmosphere, and there is certainly an Addams Family quality to the building.  The other building (where breakfasts are served) might be better, I have no way of knowing.  Oh yeah, Homer the hotel dog is adorable.

So it's a tossup, hit or miss. This establishment has many positive features, but an unqualified recommendation is difficult to make.

216,Home Away from Home,"My husband and I arrived in Dublin...but alas, our luggage did not.  We weren't planning to stay in Dublin, but since we had no luggage, we had no choice.  Since we'd stayed at Number 31 on our first trip to Ireland 4 years ago, and loved it--the gorgeous room, lovely breakfast, ambiance--we immediately called, and were deligthed a room was available. We were told to come right over.  We were kindly greeted, given a cup of coffee and some breakfast treats and shortly taken to our room.  But what made Number 31 stand apart from any other place I have ever stayed was how they responded to a very serious situation.  I did not have my perscription medications.  Being a kidney transplant recipeint, I needed help.  I was very distraught and frightened, and everyone at Number 31 comforted me and solved the problem. The staff immediately called a local pharmacy, placed long distance calls to my pharmacy and insurance provider back in the states, and ultimately Noel, the owner, drove us to the Dublin pharmacy to pick up medication.  Noel waited for us and drove us back to Number 31, drugs in hand.  They treated me like family.  When our luggage arrived the next day, they made calls to help us find a place to stay enroute to County Mayo.  Once again, Noel was there.  He led us out of the city to be sure we got on the right highway.  I have recommended Number 31 to friends, but now want to sing their praises to the world.
",5,2005,09,22
216,Stay at Number 31,"When we booked our stay at Number 31 we were looking for luxury and pampering and a place to tell stories about. Number 31 surpassed our expectations.  

Our room was one of the Georgian apartments off of Upper Fitzwilliam Street.  My wife and I and our 21 year-old daughter had plenty of room. The carriage house, where breakfast is served, is very relaxing.  A garden courtyard between the carriage house and the Georgian apartments is beautifully maintained, as are the rooms.

We enjoyed the food in Ireland, but as others have said the breakfasts they serve at Number 31 became the gold standard against which we compared others.  Nice variety and good sized helpings.  The fresh fruit were delicious! 

The staff treats you warmly from the instant you ring the bell to the moment they bring your car around and wave you off with directions to the airport.  We booked three nights at the beginning of our two-week driving tour of Ireland and two nights at the very end.  Our last two nights at Number 31 were like coming home. We highly recommend it.

216,Dublin's secret escape,"""This place is obviously too good for me,"" I thought, sipping tea and eating cake by the fireplace, while Anne took my luggage and disappeared upstairs to get me a perfectly squeezed glass of orange juice. Just what I needed after a long plane ride from the States, a relaxing living room and no one in sight. I got the chance to look at everything without being gawked at myself, the 34 year old woman-child on vacation for a week by myself. None of the usual questions about why I was traveling alone without a ring on my finger. 

Contentedly, I got a chance to look at everything. I soaked in the leather wraparound sofa, the unnecessary gorgeous fire, the clean lines of the art deco shelves with the large bric-a-brac, and the perfectly placed straw basket weaved mannequin in the corner. No dust to suggest you were in someone's home. Everything's been placed perfectly to give mood of caaalm. This works, I thought.

The living room looked just like how it did on the Internet, amazingly, and I said a silent prayer that I wouldn't run into any awful Americans while I was here. This was the first vacation I'd taken in a while by myself, and I looked forward to meeting friends in Dublin, friends who'd invited me to stay with them while in the same breath mentioning the amount of unfinished DIY. ""No thanks,"" I said. ""I'll be staying at a B&B.""

Number 31 is better than the average B&B. Quite upscale, and consequently I made sure to be on my best behavior as to not disturb the spa-like ambiance of relaxation. No one minded that I missed brekkie 3 days out of the 6, or that I only ordered the smoked salmon and eggs the days I indulged in breakfast. 

And on the day I burst into the living room soaked to the skin from coming back from a motorbike ride out in the country in a downpour (my friends' idea of schooling the American on modern pastoral Ireland), Elaine was quick to hand me a towel, sit me down, and cluck over me in a manner I'd like to be accustomed to, offering me a large tray of hot tea, fruitcake and cake with jam.

I had my own key and was permitted to come and leave as I wished, not typical of the B&Bs I'd been accustomed to. I stayed in the townhouse on Fitzwilliam Square, which meant a lovely stroll through the garden, down the path to the back of Number 31, reason to get up in the morning if I'd ever had one.

The bed was amazingly comfortable and duvet both soft and cool. Towels came every morning bright and early whether I was awake or not. I fashioned a rudimentary Do Not Disturb sign out of a paper bag after I was caught unawares on my second morning, after not finding such a sign at my disposition. I used it again when I indulged in several hot baths in the spacious tub... heaven.

The guests were of the older set, men with beards and women talking about gardening, quite pardoning of a sole quiet American interloper in their midst. I met a man who looked exactly like a beekeeper on my last day, who told me he was, enlightenly, a beekeeper. Absolutely delightful.

I took pictures of the B&B in my camera phone, sneaking it out to snap a couple when there was no one around, so I could carry them with me to remind me of this beautiful place. I show my friends, remarking ""I *stayed* there,"" and delight in their expressions when they ask if such a place truly exists. It does, and I'm going back.

216,Why am I booking for our fourth trip to No 31?,"It's a no brainer! I spend a large part of my working life staying in hotels all over the world. I made my first trip to Dublin (for pleasure) back in 2003 and stayed at N31 on the recommendation of a friend. Oh - what a pleasure. We arrived late at night to be greeted in a warm and friendly fashion and a great peat burning fire in the lounge - welcome to Ireland.

The room was great - and so individual compared to the ""oblong boxes"" of a lot of modern chain hotels. Forget the minibar, 24 hour room service, interenet access and trouser press - we are in Dublin to enjoy ourselves and reflect on those qualities of life that are being erroded by the 24/7 existence. Everyone talks of chilling out these days - and take it from me this is the place to do it.

The clientelle is diverse - young to old and from all parts of the world (NZ and Oz to the USA. This all comes together at breakfast when  the guests arrive  to feast at the large tables in the dining room and a conservatory. BEWARE - try and resist the ""full Irish breakfast"" - you will probably fail - it is just fantastic! And if your willpower is strong then the home made breads are just amazing not to mention the fresh fruit salads, berries etc etc.

So enough for the euology. The downside - well some rooms are better than others - but that is a part of the diversity and individuality of this hotel! And sometimes things don't always work 100% - but again - just chill - you are in Ireland and that's the way things are. 

My mother was born in Dublin so I think I can include this anecdote:-

Visitor arrives in Ireland and is in a taxi. He says to the driver ""I believe things are quite laid back here - so what's the equivalent word for the spanish ""manana"". The driver reflects for a moment and then replies ""we don't have one - nothing is that urgent over here"" If you can identify with that come to Ireland - slow down your 24/7 existence - and enjoy No 31 to the full! (and if you were planning to stay for xx nights just add one on when you book)

PS our favourite room is No XX (well can't say cos I don't want all you people out there to book it!!

Enjoy this unique gem soon!

Could write much more - but the rain has stopped and need to get out and mow the grass!

216,"wow, great place to stay","ok...you are in a big city,but feel like you have your own special corner.  This was a great place, with the most fabulous breakfast in all of ireland (well, at least all the places i visited!)

I had a grand room in the carriage house, with a lovely patio off the room thru double doors.  At night, the air outside was cool, and felt lovely drifting in thru the doors.

Breakfast was awesome.  Tons of fresh fruit, homemade granola, eggs, bacon, etc.  The best was the bananas and cream and fresh berries!

The staff was extemely helpful, with dinner reservations, calling cabs, etc. they even did my laundry once! (i was there for 5 days)

The best part was it was only a 5 minute walk from grafton street and st stephens green. And very quiet once inside the hotel.  They leave bottled water and cookies in your room daily.

any negatives?  Well, if you are not a morning person, do not stay in the carriage portion of the hotel.  My room was awesome, number 11, but was below the kitchen, and in the morning, i could hear people walking about. And one of the rooms is right next to the kitchen eating area!  But if you get up around 8 or so, it should work for you, as the rooms are very nice.

Would I stay here again, absolutely.  But I may try a room in the georgian part of the hotel, on one of the upper floors! (i am not a morning person)
",5,2005,08,29
216,Gracious Georgian living but beware first impressions of room,"It is difficult for all the rooms in a 200 year old house to be at their best at all times: I was disappointed to be led to a basement room (No. 16) which was sweltering on a hot muggy day (yes, this can happen in Dublin!) it was only in the cooler weather that this room came into its own; I would imagine it to be idyllic to return to in the fading light of a cold winters evening. Location great, staff very friendly.
I do not apologise for repeating the praise for their breakfast: this is surely the gold standard aginst which all ""Full Irish"" breakfasts should be measured.
",5,2005,06,28
216,An Excellent Experience,"In the interest of efficiency I hesitated to heap even more praise onto this already lauded place.  But, for my wife and me, it earned it.  

It is indeed hard to find Leeson Close.  But, so are most other places in Dublin if you are a foreigner in a car -- yikes, I've never seen so many one-way streets!  However, it was worth the effort.  

Our room was clean as a pin, the bed was excellent, the hospitality of the employees was exemplary and the location cannot be beaten.  It's just enough off of the beaten path to be quiet, but otherwise within a walk of all things touristically important.  The owners did not present themselves when we were there on June 8-9, 2005, but all others on staff were unfailingly helpful, with good restaurant and pub suggestions (and excellent directions on how to get through the maze and out of town).  So who cares if they weren't there to meet?  Maybe next time.

It was not cheap, but at 175 euros I am sure that it was cheaper than a hotel of equal ambience (not sure there could be one -- its like comparing peaches and pears).  

Biggest negative -- the place is so cool, that at first my wife just wanted to hang around the place and explore the architecture and other arrangements, rather than getting out and seeing the city.  Frankly, I could not squawk too much, and ultimately we got ourselves out the door.
",5,2005,06,12
216,Simply Superb,"As a resident of Northern Ireland, i travelled by car to Dublin for a few days, staying at Number 31 after it was recommended by a relative.

What a treat it was - Number 31 is a hotel that delivers hospitality at its finest; Noel (the owner, i believe) is always around and is extremely friendly, serving to make a trip to Dublin easy and really good fun.

I also have to say that the breakfast is one of the best i have had, and as a resident of Ireland, breakfast (in particular the fried variety) is very important to me :-)

Definately worth the few pounds extra to stay here rather than a normal, less personal hotel.
",5,2005,06,08
216,Hospitality at it's finest!,"Visited Number 31 over the Easter weekend and have discovered a treasure! It is so refreshing to find hospitality, warmth and friendliness still exists in this day and age. The premises itself is very comfortable and well situated. The breakfast cannot be praised highly enough - kept us going until the evening! The staff couldn't have been more helpful - interested in what we wanted to do and see and always took time to go the extra mile. If you're travelling to Dublin, don't pass Number 31 by!
",5,2005,04,05
216,Great Guest House!,"31 was a bit hard to find, but a great place to stay.  Myself and 4 of my friends were looking for a place to stay in Dublin for 2 nights before touring Ireland for 10 days.  While 31 wasn’t the best place we stayed (spent 1 night in a luxury hotel,) it was probably the best guest house we stayed at.  They made it quite easy to accommodate 5 traveler – which is quite a random number, they were helpful and knowledgeable about Dublin, and Ann’s breakfast loaf was great!  I would recommend 31 to anybody looking for a quaint place to stay in Dublin.
",4,2005,03,16
216,A Heavenly Oasis,"This Hotel is the most wonderful Oasis we have ever stayed.
My Husband and I checked into Number 31 for 2 nights on one of the busiest weekends of the year, the weekend of the rugby 6 nations between Ireland and England. 
Number 31 was booked solid with not a bed to spare.
We were welcomed by the lovely Anne on a very busy Satyrday morning and after the most amazing breakfast we've ever experienced in this city she was on hand to chat and provide us with all the interesting information we needed during our visit here.
Our room was splendid, beautifully decorated airy bright and spacious, very quiet even though we were situated in the heart of the city.
The staff and owners of Number 31 were incredible, they went out of their way to be helpful.
Number 31 will come highly reccomended to our friends and family, and look forward to relaxing in this heavenly Oasis on our return to Dublin
",5,2005,03,02
216,number 31  -double check what room you want,"I came to the hotel a while ago as a treat and asked for a specific room

why I was upset we were put in a normal room and when mentioned that I had requested and paid for a better type of room was given this next day without compensation and no apology

it wasnt nice as this was a pressie  

The site for the hotel does not seem to reflect what you get
",2,2005,02,16
216,Don't miss this rare treat of a hotel!,"Our experience at Number 31 was outstanding from the moment we arrived until our departure. Upon arrival at the equivalent of two o'clock in the morning (our time), we were greeted with open arms and immediately swept upstairs for tea and excellent irish breakfast. After relaxing with the lovely staff and Homer the dog, we were shown to our room and given excellent recommendations on what to do and where to go, including an excellent dinner restaurant idea. Each day upon our arrival at breakfast (you can't pass it up), Anne and staff were sincerely interested in how our previous day went and asked if we needed any assistance for our current day's adventure. Aside from the great staff, the accomodations were excellent. Our room was in the Georgian house and had more space than one could wish for in Europe. High ceilings, pretty decor, very clean. We couldn't have asked for a better location. We walked everywhere, from Trinity College, to Grafton Street, to the Jameson Distillery, to Temple Bar, Christ Church, St. Peters, the National Library, the Writers Museum, and so on. As frequent travellers to Europe, we are happy to have found this jewel of a hotel and will most certainly return to our ""home away from home"" at Number 31.
",5,2005,01,29
216,an Oasis in a busy city,"After several week of B&B's in Ireland I was ready for the luxury of #31.  It did not disappoint.  The owners treat guests like family.  The lobby is comfortable and filled with fine art.  Rooms and baths are large and comfortable.  The breakfast was several notches above the traditional Irish breakfast with homemade breads, fresh berries daily and a choice of cooked entrees.

It is about a five minute walk to St. Stephen's Green but away from the bustle of the center of Dublin.

I cannot wait to return.
",5,2004,12,30
216,The Absolute Icing on the Cake of our Irish Vacation,"My Fiancee and I recently took a 6 night break across Ireland.  We stayed in some of the finest places in Ireland from the East coast to the West coast.  We began in the Ring of Kerry at Sheen Falls Ledge (amazing), then Carrig House (phenomenal).  After staying in a wonderful castle on our third night.  We moved up to Dublin for three nights, two of which were spent at The Fitzwilliam hotel.  Our third and final night was spent at Number 31.  If it had not been for the need for a change of scenery, we could have spent the entire duration here.

How anyone can describe this place as overrated is baffling.  Number 31 is one of the most welcoming places I have ever had the pleasure of staying at.  The owners, who were on hand to chat and cook at breakfast talked with all the guests as if they had known them since school.  I cannot recommend Number 31 highly enough.  Spoil yourself.",5,2004,11,20
216,Home form home at Number 31,"I have read a couple of comments about Number 31 and having stayed for 3 nights last week, I wanted to share my experiences. I travel to Dublin on business 2 to three 3 per year and usually for 4 days with colleagues. I would normally stay at either The Westin or The Merrion but this time wanted something different and saw a review of Number 31 in Conde Nast Traveller. Ann and Noel along with their team are gracious hosts who are committed to ensuring that guests are really made to feel welcome and any of their requests accommodated. Yes it's correct that the hotel has not got  24 hr room service or valet service but this just encourages better planning. The style is possibly a little ecclectic and ""Shabby chic"" but in my opinion all the more charming for it. My room was spacious and comfortable. Breakfast was memorable especially the home baked breads. The whole experience was great and walking through the door each evening to the smell of a peat burning fire is as good as I need it to get.
",4,2004,10,11
216,"dreadful place, so not worth the money","I haven't stayed in such an awful, run-down place even when I was a student.  The rooms are not up to any standard I have seen in any hotel.  Bedheads falling from the beds, loose wiring in electrics, shabby carpets.  The place markets itself as full of antiques and unique, well I think it is uniquely awful.  I do not believe that you need to experience this absolutely dire place, and there are much better (and cheaper) places to stay.  A breakfast does not a place make, but a safe, quiet, warm, comfortable, room does.  Number 31 has none of these qualities.
",1,2004,10,07
216,I enjoyed it and will return.,"Although I do agree with some of the other comments (the place does look a bit tired) I had a great time. I travel extensively due to work, and spend over 3 months per year away from home. I avoid big hotels because they are simply too boring, and will cost just as much. Number 31 is all but boring, they made me feel welcome and everyone was keen to help. Breakfast was very good and fresh.
I would not rate it as excellent, but it wasn't terrible or below average. Maybe you ought to go there with an open mind and enjoy the experience.
See you again Number 31!
",4,2004,09,27
216,Enjoyed our stay at Number 31,"The staff were friendly and went out of their way to orient us to the city, recommend restaurants and help with theater bookings. The breakfasts were a delight each morning, both the food and the dining environment.  The coach house, with its sunken sitting area in front of the fireplace, was a pleasant place to gather with our friends and regroup.  The location was convenient, made for an easy walk almost everywhere we went, including back from the Abbey Theater.  It felt like home away from home.  We would recommend it to our friends, and would be happy to stay again.
",4,2004,09,26
216,Delighted!,"I was delighted with our stay at Number 31, and would be happy to book there again.  Breakfasts are second to none, and the staff was generous with their time and personal attention.  My room was quiet, nicely appointed and perfectly lovely up on the top floor with plenty of light coming in at rooftop level.

I would surely recommend it to friends.
",5,2004,09,24
216,Misleading advertising,"We ordered a ""deluxe double"" room and were very disappointed in the quality we found upon arrival.  The ""luxurious sitting room"" is off limits to most guests.  Don't be fooled!
",1,2004,09,18
216,Fantastic!,"Number 31 has received rave reviews all over the place since it opened and so I had decided to send my parents there for a long weekend to celebrate their 60th birthdays. Just before I booked I found this site with several negative reviews from disappointed customers. I was now torn so I rang the owner and explained. He was seriuosly concerned that anyone had stayed at his hotel and not thoroughly enjoyed themselves and assured me that he would do everything he could to ensure that my parents had a good time in Dublin, so I booked. The end result was my parents had a fabulous time. The room and the breakfast were fantastic. The staff were great, recommending the best restaurants, arranging transport and taking a generally proactive approach to looking after my folks. Highly recommended!
",5,2004,08,24
216,Our room was a dump,"This was the first hotel we booked in Ireland because we had read so many raves about it. When we were taken to our room (number 20), we honestly thought it was a joke and that we must be on ""Candid Camera."" The tiny room -- supposedly a superior double -- had no decorations on the walls, an armoire whose handles fell off when opened, and a bed that took up the whole room and sat inches away from the window that looked out on a tenement-like view. We couldn't open the window because right outside the window was a maze of fire escapes that made it feel like someone could enter the room at any time. It was like being in the middle of a ghetto -- scary, depressing and NOTHING like the descriptions in the guidebooks. Either we were given the one terrible room in the place or the hotel reviewers were paid off handsomely. Without exaggeration, the room wasn't even on par with a Motel 6. We told the manager to rip up our credit card number, and we headed over to the Shelbourne for the luxury vacation we were expecting. We're still in shock, though, and can't figure out how the owners of Number 31 can expect anyone to stay in that room.
",1,2004,08,19
216,Very disappointing.,"Recently (Aug 2004) stayed here after hearing good things but was totally unimpressed.

- impossible to get any sleep after 7:30am, which after enjoying the Dublin night life was not appreciated
- no hot water (at 6pm on a Friday evening - which is not an unreasonable requirement)
- expensive, even without the above complaints

I stay in Dublin on a regular basis and realise that hotels are generally overpriced but this place failed hopelessly on the two most important attributes of a hotel - a decent night's sleep and a good shower.

On the positive side the breakfast was good and parking is included but then parking is also included at other hotels closer to the city centre.
",1,2004,08,12
216,What a disappointment!,"Never again, and certainly wouldn't recommend it in any capacity whatsoever.

Really looked forward to our stay in Dublin at No. 31, could not have been more disappointed.  Shabby chic and faded elegance are fine, as are quirkiness and eccentricity - but No. 31 is dingy, unkempt and vastly overpriced.   Our room (Room 20) was depressing, from the tatty mirror just leaning on the washbasin, the ungrouted tiles, cheap and nasty bath panel, broken side of the bed, no remote for the TV and grubby net curtains masking a view of a scruffy fire escape etc. etc.  

A very indifferent welcome awaited us on our arrival after a phone call for help with directions (we were only five minutes away!) had been greeted with ""Sorry, can't help you. You'll have to ask someone else"".   Breakfast was no better than average, especially after some of the other fabulous offerings experienced in other hotels during our tour of Ireland.  The location is also not as good or as central as indicated, being a good 20 minute walk to the shops, and suffering from traffic noise. 

Sorry No. 31, but we have to agree with the other negative contributors' comments - you need to pay attention to detail as well as your guests!  When we checked out early, having booked two nights but only able to bear staying one, you should have bothered to ask why!!
",2,2004,07,13
216,5 star ambiance,"This is my second visit to this superbly run family hotel.I found no faults all positives a change from all the usual large chains.The ambiance is absolutely superb and I will recommend all my friends travelling , be it business or pleasure to stay at Numberv 31.
Noel and Dierdre have got it spot on and are fortunate to have staff who make you feel at home.",5,2004,05,19
216,Had a great time!,"Just got back from Ireland and had a FABULOUS time at Number 31.  I don't know where some of those other reviewers stayed but it couldn't have been the same place my wife and I were.  After spending a dreadful night in a B&B up near Temple Bar (bad beds, unfriendly host, noisy neighbors) we secured a great room at Number 31.  Upon arriving Noel greated us with warm hugs and nothing but Irish Charm.  He gave us delicious French press coffee, and homemade fruit cake while he took time to explain some of the highlights of Dublin to us.  Then he carried our bags across the courtyard and up to our room!  Who does that?! Our room was great and very very comfortable.  No smell and we actually really liked the decor. The staff was very friendly and accomadating.  Our breakfast was possibly the best we had on our entire trip and being right next to St. Stephens Green was fantastic.  We would stay here again in heartbeat.",5,2004,05,10
216,"Nice,comfortable and great breakfasts!","I'd read the previous comments with concern, and was really worried when showed to a basement room. It didn't smell of mould, and there was plenty of hot water - yes, it was a little shabby, but I was only paying 100 euros a night including breakfast.
Breakfasts were great - huge helpings of smoked salmon and scrambled eggs.
The only 'sour taste' in my mouth was a large phone bill, even though I was using a freephone number in the UK.
I would stay there again - as a single woman on my own, I felt safe and well looked after",3,2004,05,10
216,Home away from Home,"Number 31 is what makes traveling in Europe fun and unique. If you want the Holiday Inn, don't stay here. If you want wonderful hosts and staff who go out of their way to make reservations, make excellent restaurant and sightseeing suggestions, etc., stay at Number 31. If you are in a hurry and don't eat breakfast, don't stay here. If you want an outstanding breakfast with a variety of choices and a chance to meet friendly people from all over the world, then Number 31 is for you. It is in a building that is over 100 years old, in an elegant part of Dublin, yet convenient to sights, shopping, etc.. It's age means that not all the rooms are the same - and each room has its own unique quirks. This is a place for people who love the unique and original - if you have special needs such as a room not on the street because you are a light sleeper (European hotels do not have air conditioning so there can be street noise, esp. on weekends) then email your preferences - Noel Comer will do his best to accomodate. We stayed there 3 different times and occupied two different rooms. The rooms in the Main House are more luxurious and the Carriage House is more rustic; but, all the beds and bedding were comfortable, the food was outstanding whether we stayed in delux or standard rooms and the people friendly. I preferred the delux room in the Main House because it reminded me of a Merchant /Ivory film but I'll go back to Ireland and to Number 31 because of the people. It set the perfect tone for our wonderful trip to Ireland.",5,2004,04,29
216,Avoid Number 31: we had an awful experience,"Thank goodness for feedback forums such as this to read REAL reviews by REAL people- not just the ads Number 31 runs. Don't believe the hype... the place is definitely shabby, not chic. Smells. No Hot water!!! C'mon- the place is a dump and they have the gall to charge absolute top dollar ($250 US, again not what they advertise). AVOID this hovel, and enjoy your stay in Dublin.",1,2004,04,22
216,"Charming, friendly, cosy and unique! A lovely experience!!","As someone who has stayed at No 31 on several occasions I just don't recognise the place as described in some of the previous reviews! I think staying at No 31 is a real pleasure!! The guesthouse itself is lovely - the communal areas are interesting, charming and much more pleasant than those at the impersonal chain hotels. The rooms are cosy and very comfortable. In fact, the whole place has a really nice atmosphere about it. The staff have never been anything but polite and friendly, and they go out of their way to make you feel at home. The breakfast is gorgeous and the dining area is such a pretty place to eat it in! If you want to stay at a hotel - where every one is the same no matter which country of the world you are in, and where you are just a room number - then go ahead! If, however, you want a beautiful and unique experience then stay here!!",5,2004,04,13
216,"OK, me too -- really disappointed","Like most of the other recent reviewers, my companion and I had read high praise of Number 31's bohemian shabby chic, and were delighted by the courtyard and entrance hall -- indeed, as far as the first room we were offered, which looked fabulous, had no windows, and stank of damp mould. We balked, and were grudgingly given a room with a French window over the garden -- which was just a well, as proximity to the cleaning stores in the hall infused this room with the persistent stick of disinfectant, to the point that ventilation was positively necessary; however, proximity to the kitchen above (where everyone seemed to be working in wooden clogs on a tiled floor) rather dulled the charm of birdsong from the garden. The room was rich in decorative details which looked less like boho chic than a series a botched jobs, the worse for wear. After two nights of this, we relocated to The Townhouse (which is not outstanding, but has sufficient charms) and were altogether happier!",2,2004,03,28
216,"Thiefs! NO Hot Water!! Smelled like BUG REPELLENT! I cannot stress how BAD No.31 is. Smooth talk, but a dump.","I cannot write a stronger review AGAINST No. 31. It unapologetically had NO HOT WATER!!! It SMELLED strongly of bug repellent, it was NOISY, it was VERY EXPENSIVE to boot!!! The owner is not to be trusted. Do NOT stay at No. 31; we could not leave fast enough!",1,2004,03,24
216,Disappointing for the cost,"I also decided to splurge for a stay at Number 31 with my two children in June, 2003. We were given a basement level room that was quite large, but, as one reviewer noted, more shabby than chic. It also had a mildewy odor. Our room opened onto a very dirty entryway that led to an outside door so it didn't feel very secure. And the view out the window was of a dingy stairway leading up to the street. The location was OK for us as it's a moderate walk away from the center. The public areas of the hotel are quite lovely, but I noticed that no one seemed to use them. Some of the staff were quite nice, while others were quite indifferent. And I've had much better breakfasts at very inexpensive B&B's. I felt that I had wasted money at this hotel where the amenities were no where near worth the cost.",2,2004,02,23
216,Make sure you ask for a nice room!,We stayed here in October 2002 and were initially given what seemed to be a former locker/changing room with no window. We complained and managed to get moved the following night. The rooms in the main house are much better and I can't fault the staff or the breakfast. Just make sure you specify where you want to stay when you book. I wouldn't return because I think there are probably better places to stay that are more central.,4,2004,01,04
216,Shabby Chic - or just plain Shabby,"When I booked the hotel, it was the fourth most popular place to stay in Dublin on Trip advisor - by the time I got back it was going down the list fast - and I can see why. The rooms need some major maintenance. Loose sockets, broken windows, temporary covers over holes in the walls, baths which have seen better days, I was very disappointed. Only 1 member of staff was curteous. The hotel is next to a main road, which allows the Dublin nightlife right into your room. 
Very noisy between 2 and 5 am - I can only agree with another reviewers comment - if you want a good nights sleep - don't stay here - for the same Euros you can enjoy quieter hotels, with better facilities and polite staff, closer to the centre",1,2003,11,05
216,Interesting But Disappointing,"Decided to splurge and stay at Number 31 after reading many different reviews and finding myself intrigued by the uniqueness of the hotel. We were disappointed. It is a beautiful building with a magical entrance and a lovely garden. Most of the staff was friendly and gracious with a few exceptions who were somewhat haughty. Our biggest disappointment, however, was with the general shabbiness and sloppiness of the hotel. 
Although this isn't the most expensive hotel in Dublin, it is still rather pricey, and we expected a higher standard than we experienced. 
It seemed to us that the management of the hotel are resting on their hype and are not running as tight a ship as they should.",2,2003,10,23
216,Wow what a breakfast,"A friend of mine and I stayed in Number 31 for 5 days in mid June 2003. 
We stayed in the coach-house area (there is a seperate Georgian area which is more expensive) in a twin bedroom. The room was full of character and was very comfortable, particularly the beds. Breakfast was served between 8-10am, and the meal was often the highlight of the day! The cranberry loaf was spectacular, and the full Irish was also very popular. The hosts and staff took fantastic care of us - nothing we asked of them was too much trouble for them. All in all we would highly recommend Number 31 for anyone who visits Dublin. Well done Number 31!",5,2003,07,01
216,Number 31 TOP,"I stayed 3 nights in this hotel in Dublin. It can be easily reached by taking the 700 from the airport. Go down to Leeson Street Lower and after 10 steps you arrive at the hotel.
Located halfway between Stephen's Green Park and the Grand Canal Dock, it is an excellent location for all trips to the centre.
The hotel is quiet, the rooms are beautiful and spacious, the bathrooms are large and equipped with all comforts. I really enjoyed the breakfast which undoubtedly put me in a good mood every morning after waking up!!",5,2024,03,17
216,More show than substance. It looks much more beautiful in the pictures than it actually is.,"Unfortunately, the hotel was a disappointment for the price.
A lot of things looked worn and not cleaned well. You shouldn't run your fingers over the edge of the bed or the closet.
There are no shelves for clothes or in the bathroom.
There are no refrigerators in the rooms.
The service itself was very courteous and helpful, though.",3,2023,08,11
216,Historisch und geschmackvoll,"Vor unserem Rückflug nach Deutschland haben wir eine Nacht im Nr 31 verbracht und wie gewünscht einen großzügigen, geschmackvollen und dank Schallschutz ruhigen Raum erhalten. Auch das Frühstück kann man nur als außergewöhnlich bezeichnen 😀",4,2023,07,21
216,Familiär geführtes Boutique-Hotel mit sehr gutem Frühstück,"Romantisches Hotel  mit Style und lockerer Atmosphäre.  Sehr freundliches Personal. Das Frühstück ist reichhaltig, auswahlreich und mit liebe zubereitet. Zimmer sind sauber und authentisch, gemütliche Lounge mit Bar (Selbstbedienung). Kleiner, romantischer und gepflegter Garten im Innenhof. Alles was man für ein Besuch in Dublin braucht.

Gehdistanz zum Ausgehviertel Temple Pub / Kathedrale  etwa 2 km (30 Minuten), Bushaltestellen in der Nähe, Hop on/of Haltestelle in 1.2 km zu erreichen (15 Minuten).",5,2023,07,12
216,Entzückendes Hotel in guter Lage,"Originell ausgestattete Zimmer mit Atmosphäre. Wir waren zuerst im vorderen Bereich des Hauses in einem modern gestalteten Zimmer untergebracht, das sogar einen privaten Sitzplatz im Innenhof hatte. Wegen eines Problems mit dem Abfluss mussten wir umziehen in eines der Zimmer im Hinterhaus. Dort ist alles nach dem Thema Jazz gestaltet mit Art-Deco-Tapeten, schweren Samtvorhängen, Lampen und Möbeln im Stil der Thirties - sehr stylisch und heimelig. Obwohl das Zimmer zur Straße lag, waren wir durch den Lärm wenig gestört, da es eine gesondert schließbare Scheibe als Lärmschutz-Screen gibt.
Das Frühstück war ebenso hervorragend wie die Qualität der Betten.
Und das Wichtigste: wir fühlten uns willkommen und rundum gut betreut von dem außerordentlich freundlichen und hilfsbereiten Personal. 
Definitiv eine Empfehlung!",5,2021,10,06
216,“Esperienza Unica”,"Ho trascorso 10 giorni a Dublino ospite di questo meraviglioso Be&B. Le camere sono belle e confortevoli ma ciò che fa la differenza è l’attenzione che il personale riserva ai propri ospiti. Sembra di stare in famiglia ma con l’attenzione e il servizio di professionisti del settore. Ambiente di giovani ma con l’accuratezza e la disponibilità a risolvere ogni possibile richiesta degli ospiti. In particolare Adriana, gentile e premurosa in  ogni momento del mio soggiorno. Una menzione a parte merita la prima colazione, organizzata dallo chef Delia Brachen, ( Delia)  una persona “speciale” che riesce a trasferire nel suo Delia’ Breakfast menu tutti i sapori e gli odori di questa straordinaria terra che è l’irlanda. Ma qualunque desiderio tu abbia per la colazione, “Mamma Delia” è li pronta ad esaudire i tuoi desideri anche quelli che non hai espresso, capace com’è di intuire già al secondo giorno i tuoi gusti e reinterpretare le pietanza col solo fine di esaltare il tuo palato. Credetemi “ unica”. Spero tanto di poter tornare a Dublino e rivivere questa esperienza coccolato da “ Mamma Delia”  Un caro saluto a tutti. Francesco",5,2019,08,24
216,Trendiges Hotel in zentraler Lage,"Empfang sehr freundlich.
Zimmer wie gesamtes Hotel trendig eingerichtet - nur leider hatten wir ein Zimmer im 4. Stock ohne Lift!
Frühstück typisch irisch - gute Qualität.
Getränke an der Bar nimmt man sich selbst und trägt es in eine Liste ein.",4,2018,10,27
216,Tolles Frühstück,"Wir waren für 4 Nächte im Number 31. Die Lage in der Nähe des St Stephen’s Green ist gut. Das Frühstück war sehr lecker und reichlich! Eine Auswahl an warmen Speisen wurde frisch zubereitet und die Qualität war toll!
Unser Zimmer (Nummer 46) war groß, ruhig und sauber! 
Gestört haben uns letztendlich nur zwei Punkte; die Lüftung im Zimmer hat morgens extremen Küchengeruch in unserem Zimmer verbreitet. Ein Hinweis an die Rezeption ist erfolgt. Leider war auch die Beleuchtung im Bad nicht optimal. Es ist insgesamt schon sehr dunkel gewesen.
Wir haben uns alles in allem wohl gefühlt, aufgrund der kleinen genannten Mängel und des doch nicht ganz günstigen Preises würden wir das Number 31 als „gut“ bewerten. ",3,2018,08,17
216,Tolle Lage und sehr wohl gefühlt,"Mit dem Aircoach vom Flughafen in die Stadt und dann noch etwa 5 Minuten zu Fuss, dass ist das Number 31 bereits erreicht. Der anschl. Empfang, die Führung zum und Erklärung im Zimmer sowie dann auch der jeweilige Service beim Frühstück oder Reservationen in Restaurants etc. alles hat toll geklappt. Unser Zimmer 19 würden wir wieder buchen. Es geht nach Innen zum Hof und Garten. Hier ist der Strassenlärm durch eine Mauer gedämpft und wir konnten bei offenem Fenster gut schlafen. Zu erwähnen ist auch das Frühstück. Die warmen Speisen werden frisch zubereitet und sind wirklich lecker. Auch hier war Service toll und wenn der Andrang nicht mehr sehr gross war immer auch die Chefin in der Küche unterwegs im Speisesaal und für einen Schwatz zu haben. Zu Fuss ist man in ca. 10 Minuten durch den Stephensgreenpark mitten in der Stadt oder z.B. an der Grafton Street. Auf die andere Seite ist man in Minuten an einem Kanal mit Schleusen und schönen Spazierwegen um z.B. Richtung Hafen zu gelangen. Wieder mal in Dublin wissen wir auf jedne Fall wohin.",5,2018,07,15
216,Piacevole soggiorno,"Camera accogliente e ampia con belle poltrone su cui leggere bevendo un tè, letto comodo, bel giardinetto (ma a dicembre con il freddo che fa non ne abbiamo approfittato molto!). Abbiamo apprezzato anche lo spazio comune, con un bel divano attorno al camino. Pulito, curato e accogliente. Grande varietà per una colazione salata e abbondante, anche se non manca la frutta fresca e pane e marmellata. ",5,2017,12,17
216,davvero perfetto,"L'hotel è davvero bello. E' in una zona tranquilla, ma non troppo distante dal centro anzi solo 10 minuti a piedi. La camera dove alloggiavamo era grande e spaziosa dotata di wifi veloce, TV a schermo piatto e phon di 2000W, anche il bagno non era niente male: doccia grande e molti campionicini di prodotti come bagnoschiuma, shampoo, balsamo e anche crema idratante. Il servizio è molto buono, colazione abbondante con vari tipi di uova ma anche frutta, cereali, yogurt e succhi. Le persone sono molto gentili e disponibili anche a fornire adattatori per le prese e acqua calda per i te serali. E' anche presente un piccolo giardino, assai grazioso.
Assolutamente consigliato se state cercando una sistemazione a Dublino.",5,2017,06,05
216,Alojamiento para una escapada corta,"La ubicación es aceptable a un poco más de un km de las principales atracciones de la ciudad. Fuimos en automóvil y resulto muy cómodo para salir a lugares fuera de la ciudad.
Las habitaciones son un tanto justas (nos alojamos en la casa, no en el edificio) y podrian mejorarse algunos aspectos funcionales y de instalaciones.
El desayuno es personalizado y lo mejor (a mi gusto) que ofrece el establecimiento, amplia variedad y dispuestos a preparar lo que más te guste.
La relación precio/prestación me parece un poco elevada.
Si vuelvo a Dublin le daría prioridad a explorar otras opciones.",3,2017,04,07
216,Sehr freundliches Personal aber die Zimmer sind knapp 3 Sterne tauglich,"Wir wurden sehr zuvorkommend bedient. Die Zimmer wurden uns 4 Parteien zum selben Preis angeboten. Die Unterschiede in der Grösse ca. 15 - 24 m2 und bei der Lage ruhig zum Innenhof oder zu einer lauten 4-spurigen Strasse sind enorm. Es lohnt sich also bei der Buchung nachzufragen, was für ein Zimmer man bekommt. Frühstück ist top.",3,2016,11,28
216,"Laut, laut, laut","süsses Hotel mit 2 Schwachpunkten: Egal welches Zimmer (haben 3 ausprobiert), alle sind laut. Das erste Zimmer war unter der Treppe im alten Teil des Hauses. Dort hörte man jeden, der auf und ab ging. Eine Zumutung. Stickig war es außerdem.
Das Personal war zwar bemüht aber wehe man kommt am Abend an: der Nachtportier ist nicht sehr fähig und versteckt sich schnell in seinem Büro (Rezeption gab es gar nicht, nur ein Büro, welches man suchen musste). Also Ankunft tagsüber wäre ratsam und dann sich erklären lassen wo die ""Rezeption"" ist und am besten im alten Teil des Hauses wohnen (dort ist halt nur Straßenlärm) Daher überteuert und nicht zu empfehlen",1,2016,08,29
216,Oase zentral in der Stadt,"Dieses Hotel ist äußerlich unscheinbar (ja, kaum zu finden) aber innerlich wunderschön und liebevoll aufgebaut. Der Eigentümer und seine Angestellten geben jedem jederzeit das Gefühl, herzlich willkommen zu sein (die Koffer werden transportiert, der PKW eingeparkt, ein Willkommens-Kaffe/-Tee serviert, ...)!

Das individuell zubereitete Frühstück ist super, WLAN überall verfügbar und auch die zentrale Lage ist perfekt für die Stadtbesichtigung. Der Preis ist natürlich extrem hoch, aber für diese Qualität mitten im Stadtkern angebracht.

Einziger Minuspunkt, der es eben nicht zu fünf Punkten brachte, ist die Hellhörigkeit in den Zimmern. Das starke Husten des Nachbargastes sowie die sprechenden Gäste auf dem Flur haben einige Male die Nachtruhe gestört dünne Wände und schlechte Türen).",4,2016,07,21
216,Wer nach Dublin reist muss im Number 31 wohnen!  (Number 1 in Dublin by far),"Ein Kleinod,
eine Wucht,
und erst das Personal,
so stylish,
so gemütlich,
und erst der Garten,
so freundlich, 
so herzlich.
und erst das Frühstück,
und und und,
man kann einfach nicht genug schwärmen.
Schnell ist hier glasklar:
Wer nach Dublin reist muss im Number 31 wohnen!",5,2016,06,27
216,Ein kleines Juwel,Mein Aufenthalt in Dublin war allein schon wegen dieser Unterkunft ein absolutes Highlight. Das liebevoll eingerichtete Hotel liegt perfekt zum Zentrum. Das Personal ist sehr freundlich und bemüht. Die Zimmer gemütlich und sauber. Das Frühstück einzigartig und es hätte nicht perfekter sein können. Man fühlt sich schon beim Eintreten wie zu Hause. Dieses Haus ist ein Juwel im Herzen der Stadt.,5,2016,03,25
216,Traumhaftes Hotel in Dublin,"Das Number 31 ist eine kleine Insel in der Stadt, speziel wegen dem wunderschönen Garten im Hinterhof.
Die Zimmer sind geräumig und sehr geschmackvoll eingerichtet.
Bei der Ankunft wird Tee und Gebäck offeriert.
Das Frühstück war sehr umfangreich und sehr gut.
Desweiteren wurden uns die Seheneswürdigeiten, welche man dann sehr gut zu Fuss erkunden kann sehr gut erklärt.",5,2014,10,26
216,home,"E' stato come essere a casa! La location è straordinaria, centralissima e quindi abbiamo raggiunto a piedi ogni zona della città e anche di sera abbiamo camminato senza nessun problema. I proprietari e chi ci lavora è disponibilissimo a fornire tutte le informazioni sui posti da vedere, dove andare a mangiare e i pub migliori. I suggerimenti di Adam sono stati a dir poco eccezionali e azzeccati!! La casa è pulita e confortevole, la colazione davvero all'altezza delle storia che vi si raccontano. Vorrei tanto tornarci.
Diciamo pure che è piuttosto caro, ma i soldi spesi li valeva tutti. Un consiglio: approfittate della colazione e fatela bella abbondante, arriverete a sera senza dover spendere per il pranzo.",5,2014,08,24
216,Das Frühstück ist reichlich...,"Parken ist hier etwas tricky- das Personal übernimmt den Job.
Zimmer im zweiten Trakt nicht zu klein- Bad mit fester Duschwand aus Glas.( etwas spritzig)
W-Lan im Zimmer, mit wechselndem Erfolg. Gibt einen Check in Kaffee mit Scone kostenfrei-
das tut gut nach regnerischer !Anfahrt. Obacht- Parkplatz vorm Hotel mit Stahlpfosten und Ketten.
Bei Nacht & Regen immer für nen Blechschaden gut.:-(
Noel ist sehr freundlich und hilft bei Mietwagen Rückgabe & Taxi.(Natürlich auch bei Restaurantsuche etc) Hotel ist nich weit vom St.Stephens Green.Dort auch ATM.
Danke ans Team- für das Wetter könnt Ihr ja nix.",4,2014,08,20
216,Tolles Hotel mit charme!,"Tolles, zentral gelegenes Hotel im Herzen Dublins. Die Zimmer sind sehr schön und luxuriös ausgestattet. Der Service im Hotel ist sehr aufmerksam und bemüht. Wir wurden ausführlcih über Sehenswürdigkeiten und Ausflugsziel informiert. Das Frühstück ist ein echtes Erlebnis, kann ich nur empfehlen!",5,2014,04,15
216,Ein perfektes Wochenende,"Ein Wochenende in Dublin bei strahlendem Sonnenschein und dann in diesem wunderschönen Hotel, mit dem fantastischen Frühstück, was will man mehr. Der Besitzer Noel kümmert sich wirklich rührend - bucht Taxi und Leihwagen und gibt einem einen Überlick was man sich anschauen muss. Man fühlt sich fast wie zu Hause, nur besser. Alles sieht tatsächlich so aus wie auf den Fotos der Website. Das Frühstück ist wirklich köstlich.  Die meisten Sehenswürdigkeiten sind zu Fuss problemlos zu erreichen. Die Bushaltestelle zum Flugplatz ist grad mal um die Ecke. Hop on Hop off Bus hält am St Stephens Green, nur einige Minuten entfernt. Natürlich kann es in einer Stadt auch mal laut sein, wer das nicht möchte, der sollte vielleicht besser irgendwo aufs Land fahren wo es nur Schafe gibt. Sollten wir jemals wieder nach Dublin kommen werden wir auf jeden Fall wieder im No 31 wohnen.",5,2013,09,24
216,Nettes kleines ausgefallenes Hotel,"Die Lage ist optimal. Die Betreuung ist perfekt. Die Inhaber kümmern sich persönlich um die Gäste, dass merkt man die Haus an. Das Frühstück ist ausgezeichnet. Ein vergleichbares Haus hatten wir bisher nur in Killarny. Das Hotel ist sehr individuell eingerichtet, was uns sehr gut gefallen hat.",5,2013,09,16
216,Affascinante,"Una casa storica unita ad una seconda casa storica per mezzo di un bel giardino privato, il tutto rinnovato con gusto, charme e comfort.
Un albergo piccolo, molto curato, con grande attenzione allo stile e al servizio. Belli anche gli spazi comuni con un gran soggiorno con camino e uno spazio colazione con soppalco con vista giardino. La storia del luogo poi riporta ai tempi d'oro della Dublino degli anni '70, anche se ora tutto é curato, ovatttato e rarefatto. Il gestore potrà raccontarvi tutto quello che vorrete sentirvi dire. Trattandosi di un edificio storico le camere sono diverse tra loro e non c'é ascensore, ma ne vale la pena.",5,2013,05,02
216,No vale lo que cuesta ni de lejos,"Nos alojamos en este B&B (lo de hotel boutique le queda grande) fiandonos de las opiniones del tripadvisor, la habitación que nos dieron  da a la cocina cuando llegamos la atravesamos directamente para llegar a nuestra habitación, y aunque era amplia, las ventanas estaban a ras de suelo y el baño era estrechisimo.
Cuando solicites la habitación pide que no te la den en el edificio donde desayunas, habia otra habitacion peor que daba directamente al salón de desayunos...Las peores la 45 y 46
La atención era muy correcta y el desayuno completo.
El precio por noche que vale ni de lejos lo justifica, cuesta como uno de 5 estrellas y se queda muy lejos de esa categoria. 
Las toallas de la ducha son para liliputienses.
La zona esta a un buen rato andando del centro, pero es una zona buena con la universidad catolica al lado, oficinas y zona residencial. Es una zona muy muy tranquila. Aunque hay un dancepool al lado...
Si vuelvo a Dublin (que eso espero) seguro que aqui no vuelvo
Me ha parecido un robo, vale 60€ por noche como muchiiiiisimo. y te cobran casi tres veces más....",3,2013,01,18
216,El mejor hotel de Dublín,"Solo tengo cosas buenas que decir de la magnífica experiencia que ha supuesto mi estancia en Number 31. El hotel está situado en la parte más bonita de la ciudad y puedes ir andando a todas las atracciones principales de Dublín en un agradable paseo. La habitación era preciosa, cálida, muy silenciosa y tranquila e incluso con unas bonitas vistas a Fritzwilliam Street. Nos tocó en uno de los dos edificios de los que se compone el hotel y teníamos que atravesar el bonito jardín para desayunar cada mañana. El desayuno era increíble, tanto la abundante y exquisita comida que servían como las atenciones de los dueños del hotel y todo el personal. Solo puedo estar agradecido al magnífico trato que nos han dispensado y recomendar encarecidamente este hotel, cuya decoración, ambiente,  instalaciones y atención al cliente son inmejorables.",5,2012,10,23
216,Sehr Exclusiv,"Dieses Hotel ist bislang das erste das mir ein lautes ""wow"" beim rein kommen abgeluchst hat. Schwierig zu finden (wenn der Reiseführer nicht präzise genug ist und man vorher kein Foto gesehen hat) versteckt sich diese Perle im Herzen der Stadt. Ein typischer, gregorianischer Altbau der absolut modern getrimmt wurde. Kaminzimmer und Garten sind wunderschön gestaltet und die Aussicht von unserem Zimmer im 4. Stock war genial.
Beim Frühstück gibt es drei lange Tische an denen man mit den anderen Gästen gemeinsam Speißt. Es gibt jeden morgen frisches Obst und Gemüse (weit mehr als das was man sonst gewohnt ist!!!) und verschiedene Sorten Müsli, außerdem bekommt man Tee oder Kaffee serviert dazu frischen Saft, Soda bread und Kuchen. Zu guter Letzt darf man aus einem reichhaltigen warmen Frühstücksangebot wählen, von denen eins besser ist als das andere!
Die Betten sind super bequem. die Badezimmer modern, sauber und (zumindest unser Zimmer) mit Regendusche ausgestattet. 
Ich hätte einziehen können :-)",5,2012,08,23
216,Individueller gehts nicht mehr....,"Was für ein toller Fund dieses Numer31 Hotel mitten in Dublin.

Ich fand die Lage gut bis sehr gut...2 Minuten zu Fuss zum Airport Bus...viele leckere gehobene Restaurants in der Umgebung und 5 Minuten zum St Stephen Greens Park...
Ein Parkplatz ist auch dabei..also hier gibts wirklich gar nichts zu meckern.

Die Zimmer sind modern eingerichtet....wunderbar kuschelige Betten, flauschiger Teppich, mehrere Schränke, viele Stuck an den Wänden und 3 Meter Raumhöhe . Es gab ein schönes Bad mit Wasserfalldusche - einfach beeindruckend...

Leider gabs keine Minibar oder einen Kühlschrank und das Internet war auch nicht free of charge. Hier ist noch kleiner Verbesserungsbedarf vorhanden. Manche Zimmer liegen direkt an der Strasse, das kann für empfindliche Menschen etwas zu laut sein - uns hats nicht gestört und wems zu laut ist verlangt einfach ein Zimmer nach hinten raus.

Der persönliche Service des Number 31 ist beeindruckend...das Frühstück wurde hier schon oft beschrieben und ist mit großer Liebe und Aufmerksamkeit zubereitet. Die Egg Benedicts sind sensationell lecker. Gleiches gilt für den Frühstückskuchen und die verschiedenen Früchte. Gleich bei Ankunft bekommt man Kaffee und Kekse und einen Stadtplan mit allen Highlights persönlich erklärt.

Tolle moderne Zimmer, sehr freundlicher Service und lecker Essen...besser gehts doch eigentlich nicht mehr, oder?",5,2011,11,03
216,Ausgezeichnet!,"Hätte ich auch ein 'irre großes' Zimmer gehabt, wären wohl fünf Bewertungspunkte herausgekommen. Aber ich war alleine unterwegs und habe deshalb vermutlich ein kleines Zimmer im Untergeschoß bekommen. Dafür war es aber total ruhig! Gut, die Dielen knarren, wenn der Nachbar über einem herumläuft. Fön, Block, Stifte gibt es nicht. Aber das Bad war dafür sehr modern.

Das Frühstück ist das Beste, was ich seit langem serviert bekommen habe. Der Preis ist absolut in Ordnung. Und der Besitzer behandelt einen, als sei man ein Familienmitglied. Grandios! Die Lage ist nicht super zentral, aber trotzdem gut. Ich bin sowieso meistens Taxi gefahren (allerdings kennen viele Taxifahrer die Straße nicht!). Deshalb vielleicht am besten die Wegbeschreibung ausdrucken, wenn man vom Flughafen mit dem Taxi anreist (kostet 28 EUR).",4,2011,10,24
216,Hervorragendes Frühstück!,"Das Number 31 kann man fast nicht als B&B bezeichnen. Gleich nach der Ankunft (bei strömendem Regen) wurden wir überschwänglich mit Tee & Cookies begrüßt und konnten uns erst einmal in Ruhe am offenen Kamin aufwärmen. Das Zimmer welches wir bekamen lag leider im Untergeschoß und war etwas dunkler, dennoch aber schön eingerichtet und vor allem riesig. Das gesamte Haus (bzw. die beiden durch einen Garten verbundenen Häuser) strahlen einen gemütlichen Charme aus. Das absolute Highlight ist das üppige Frühstück, das an großen Gemeinschaftstischen eingenommen wird. Leider ist das Number 31 schon eher teuer.",4,2011,09,20
216,NUMBER 31 IS NUMBER ONE|!,"Abbiamo scelto il Number 31, che si trova nel bellissimo e tranquillo quartiere georgiano di Dublino, quindi, in ottima posizione per visitare tutti i quartieri, i musei, i monumenti e le bellezze della città. Intorno ci sono parchi, ristoranti, banche e negozi di ogni tipo. Le camere sono spaziose, confortevoli e arredate con un'estetica che coniuga il gusto vittoriano alla modernità. La colazione comprende toast, marmellate, torte, latte, caffè, tea, frittate, omelette, bacon...e ci faceva iniziare la giornata felici. Il personale è disponibilissimo e, soprattutto, avendo la chiave del portone principale, è possibile muoversi ad ogni ora del giorno e della notte in totale libertà.",5,2011,08,18
216,Design und Komfort,"Das B&B, wenn man es überhaupt so nennen darf, ist in einem georgianischen Vorderhaus und einem, von einem berühmten Architekten umgebauten Coachhouse untergebracht. Dazwischen liegt ein kleiner, schöner Garten. Unser Zimmer im Vorderhaus, wie auch alle öffentlichen Räume, war in jeder Hinsicht ansprechend und hochwertigst ausgestattet. Man fühlt sich wie in einem erstklassigen Hotel. Die Betreuung durch den Besitzer hätte nicht freundlicher und besser sein können und das wundervolle Frühstück haben wir jeden Morgen ausgiebig genossen.",5,2011,08,10
216,splendido,"Familiare, caldo, elegante, pulito, impeccabile. Un'esperienza indimenticabile e da ripetere. Colazione eccezionale.",5,2010,09,10
216,Ruhig & komplett (positiv) unerwartet,"Liegt ruhig & in Laufweite Zentrum. Bei dem Frühstück würde man sich wünschen, man könnte die Zeit zurückdrehen und selbiges noch einmal geniessen. Irre grosse Zimmer für Dublin.",5,2009,08,17
216,Grande ospitalità Irlandese,"Grande  ospitalità oramai rara in altre strutture. Forse alla conduzione familiare ma di grandissima competenza e qualità è dovuta l'ottima impressione ricevuta all'arrivo: fuoco acceso nel camino, cordialità con tea e biscotti,  disponibilità di Bart (l'impegato di turno) nel darci i primi ragguagli sulla città e nell'accompagnarci in camera, assisterci nella sostituzione della tipologia di alloggio. La mattina a colazione conosciamo il proprietario (credo) che ci accoglie con un sorriso, le presentazioni ed una stretta di mano. Ma quando mai capita ancora?! 
Una discrezione intima sia nel servizio di cui abbiamo goduto, sia della struttura che tutto sembra fuorchè un hotel (i due ingressi sono due ignote porte tipiche colorate alla Dublinese). A 15 minuti a piedi dal Tample Bar ma ancora più vicina a Grafton Street e dintorni, la consiglio assolutamente a tutti coloro che cercano un certo stile anche in vacanza..",4,2007,11,13
216,Number 31 erfüllt die Erwartungen nicht,"Das Number 31 liegt im wunderschönen georgianischen Viertel Dublins mit guter Busverbin  dung zum Stadtzentrum und den Sehenswürdigkeiten. Auch die Lauflage durch St. Stephen´s Green ist günstig. Es besteht aus einem modernen Designbau, einem Hofgarten und dem georgianischen Haupthaus, ein ehemaliges herrschaftliches Wohnhaus.
Die Zimmer im georgianischen Bau sind allerdings für den Preis (160 Euro pro Person/Einzelzimmer p. Nacht inkl. Frühstück) zu spärlich eingerichtet (kein Tisch, offene Nische mit Kleiderstange, winziges Bad, keine Wanne, keine Ablage für Toilettenartikel, Heizung ließ sich nicht regulieren, es gab nur an (Brutkasten) oder aus (Kühlschrank). Über das Design (düstere Farben, Verzicht auf Accessoires oder Bilder, ein Spiegel lehnt nur an der Wand in falscher Höhe) kann man verschiedener Meinung sein. Wir fanden es zu ""gewollt"", nicht zu Ende gedacht, eher improvisiert. Wirklich hervorragend waren die Kingsizebetten, jedoch zu groß für das kleine Zimmer. 
Der Service war sehr freundlich und für ein B&B ausgesprochen aufmerksam. Das machte vieles wett. Auch das irish breakfast hatte hohen Standard. Die Beeinträchtigungen durch den Verkehrslärm auf Fitzgeralds Place und  Leeson Street  konnten diese positiven Bemühungen allerdings nicht auslgeichen. Die beiden mehrspurigen Straßen, die das Haus umrahmen, ruhen nie, außer am Sonntag morgen. Doppelverglasung der Fenster würde dem Haus helfen. Ansonsten möchten wir nicht mehr dorthin zurückkehren.",3,2007,10,29
