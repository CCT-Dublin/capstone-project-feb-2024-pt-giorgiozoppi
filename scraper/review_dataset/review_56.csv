56,Great Stay. Ignore the negative reviews.,"Booked a Penthouse for 9.
Was abit concerned after reading some of the reviews but everything was perfect.
I would definitely come again.
Property was clean, no problems with any residents. We played music after 10pm quietly and no problems and was on the balcony till 2am talking without any complaints.
Pool area is very clean and quiet. we mainly went to the beach in the day or into the city if we were getting rowdy.

Pool is best to go in smaller groups for an hour here or there just to cool off. We only ever went down as a 3.
Also, staff were helpful.
They did us a good price on some scooters which I would highly reccomend and helped us with Taxis.
Also we already have our deposit back after 2 days which we had pretty much given up on based on some of the other reviews.
Great stay at a unbelievable penthouse with fantastic views.
Bit of a walk to la rambla but public transport and scooter you could get anywhere in 20-30 mins.
Definitely worth it",5,2019,09,10
56,Nice enough location but you feel unwelcome,"We rented this apartment due to the location to the beach and the restaurants and for those 2 things we couldn’t really complain. What we did find when we got there is that the apartment was just one of a few owned by the booking company and the rest of the block were all owned by residents. Now with 10 lads on a stag weekend I feel we were extremely well behaved. But on the very first day it was clear the locals did not appreciate tourists being in “their” apartment block. They complained to security about any little thing and did not want us using the pool with them. Which was a shame as it was a nice pool but we didn’t get to use it as felt we shouldn’t be there. The apartment was good.  Had all the amenities and items you needed for a weekend away. It could have done with a few fixes to the floor as parts were broken. Also some additional charges when you get there for tourist tax and using their beach towels so just make sure you have some additional euros. I think if you were a family with kids staying there you would be fine, but if you are a group of lads just be warned that you need to keep quiet and would prob go out when you can as the locals in the block won’t want you there ",3,2019,07,16
56,sehr schlecht,"Wir waren als Familie (2 Erwachsene und 3 Kinder) im August diesen Jahres Gäste im Rent top Apartment Beach diagonal Mar, wir haben für 10 Tage über 7000 Euro bezahlt und hatten ein superior Apartment gebucht, leider entsprach dieses in keinem Fall den im Internet dargestellten Fotos, es war extrem abgewohnt, schmutzig. Wir haben dies auch bei der Übergabe beim Einchecken sofort reklamiert, auch die Größe des Aparments hat leider nicht gestimmt (ausgemacht waren 120 m2, geschätzt sicher nicht größer als 80 m2). Es wurde das Aparment nach unserer Reklamation zwar geputzt und die Fenster waren dann zumindest sauber, der Rest aber leider nicht, schmutziger Fußboden, schmutziger Kasten, etc. Ich rate jedem davon ab um diesen Preis dieses Apartment zu buchen, ein reiner FAKE!!!!",1,2019,09,01
