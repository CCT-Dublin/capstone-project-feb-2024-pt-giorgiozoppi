120,Hilton Bankside London,"The staff, service and food are amazing, especially Dominico, Terence & Luther. They went above and beyond to fulfill our dietary needs. We have allergies to gluten and dairy. I highly recommend staying here. They even had gluten-free bread and deserts.",5,2024,10,19
120,A little luxury in London ,"I had the pleasure of enjoying a weekend break for my birthday hosted by the fabulous Hilton by Bankside. Upon arriving we were greeted warmly by all the staff from the door man to the lady at reception. On our initial presentation the reception was busy with other guests but we were taken care of by the gentleman at the door; he seated us and provided a chilled glass of bubbles while we waited. Staff were extremely efficient and we were seen to quite quickly. The lady recognised my companion from some correspondence they shared prior to our arrival; and unexpectedly wished me happy birthday which was a nice touch. Our luggage and coats were taken and brought to our room. Unanticipatedly again - our experience was amplified as we were unexpectedly given an upgraded room- which only heightened the experience further  - we were given a one bedroom suite with lounge access. The room itself was large, luxurious and impeccably clean. They had a lovely birthday package set up in the lounge for me- birthday balloons, cake, a chilled bottle of bubbles aswell as a little birthday card. These touches were amazing and much appreciated.
The lounge was large, comfortable and the mini fridge was well stocked with a variety of drinks and snacks. The bathroom was impeccably clean and all toiletries were provided along with plenty of fresh fluffy towels. The bed itself was large and comfortable. There was ample storage and hanging space for our things aswell as a safe for valuables. The sound proofed rooms insured a some what intimate environment with no noisy distractions and allowing us to listen to music etc without worrying about disturbing other guests  - this is something all hotels should have. Much of the suite was windowed- which made it feel very light and spacious but unfortunately but not surprisingly being set in a big city we didn't have ""a view"" as such but we couldn't complain. The room was a cosy sanctuary for us to base our weekend adventuring around London.
We enjoyed some tasty cocktails in the distillery bar before venturing to the West end for a show.  Staff were helpful with providing help with directions etc. I had a great night's sleep when we returned and was comfortable and well rested.
We enjoyed breakfast in the oxbo restaurant in the morning- there was a wide variety of food and drinks available; definitely something for everyone. I sampled various things  - although perhaps some of the hot food options weren't to my own personal taste. The only other slight criticism was I note the staff although present weren't particularly friendly or forthcoming although again none were rude either. The coffee was not to our taste either though I acknowledge these are minor things and primarily down to my personal preferences.
We returned to the room and changed into swimwear and used the robes provided. We had planned to grab a quick drink then use the pool however we were not allowed into the reception; in hindsight this was most likely as a courtesy to other guests.  We didn't mind though- staff were pleasant and we proceeded to the hotels lesuire area  - small gym and a pool with a shallow seated area with jets  - similar to a hot tub but definitely not hot. The pool was pretty cold but fine once we got in. The area was clean but somewhat basic in comparison to other hotels that provide additional facilities such as sauna, steam room or hotub; this could possibly be a thought in the future if the space was to be upgraded. I definitely think it would be a welcome asset.
On returning to our room it was being serviced by the maid and unfortunately as we were in the robes we couldn't venture elsewhere in the hotel to allow time for her to uninterruptedly complete her tasks. We tried to delay a little but had to go back shortly after ,because of this i'm not sure she had completed everything she wanted to. I later asked for more towels and they were provided.
Staff were noticeably on hand to offer assistance throughout our stay- booking taxis, providing recommendations, directions and tips for getting the most out of our time in London.
On departure day- we were rung I believe to ensure checkout- although probably essential it in essence made us feel a little rushed. Though we did request and got our late checkout as requested on our arrival which was good. We finished off with a bite to eat and some drinks in the distillery - the staff were friendly and we enjoyed the atmosphere. The themed/speciality drink on offer and chocolate was a cute touch.
Overall we had a very positive experience with our stay at the hilton and I would absolutely recommend to anyone wishing to stay in London. I would myself return in a heart beat.  

Thankyou for hosting a wonderful stay.",5,2023,07,13
120,Great customer experience,"I had some drinks at the bar and shubrankar took great care of me! He’s amazing I recommend coming here to eat, drink and stay. 
The service is amazing, fiod was good and the bartender is super sweet, he’s very professional and respectful of the customers.",5,2024,10,18
120,Consistently Excellent Stay with Impressive Amenities!,"I recently stayed here for the second time, enjoying one night on Saturday, October 12th, and I can confidently say this experience was just as excellent as my first.

Check-in was quick, and I felt warmly welcomed. I was assigned room 119, a king executive room with lounge access.

While the room felt slightly smaller than I expected—likely due to the work desk positioned behind the bed—it still met my high standards for a five-star hotel.

The bathroom was spacious, featuring both a bath and a walk-in rainfall shower, which might be the best I’ve ever experienced.

The gym and pool were well-equipped and surprisingly not crowded for a Saturday night.",5,2024,10,18
120,Memorable family vacation,"Excellent stay with friendly, helpful staff who all went above and beyond, with a great breakfast variety every day. Rooms were in excellent condition and well appointed. All public areas from the fitness center, swimming pool, executive longue, and breakfast areas were immaculate. The doormen and concierge were all extremely helpful and efficient in every way, I, unfortunately, only caught Daniel's name, but all the staff made our stay memorable. Thank you for everything. ",5,2024,10,15
120,Positively Surprised from this facility - Great Location,"Well...I was not expecting anything impressive from this hotel but once I was there I was positively impressed by the rooms, the conference facility and the food which was really good both at Breakfast and in the lobby bar. One of the best club sandwich I have ever eaten by the way.
Moreover the location is absolutely central and perfect! Definitively a place that I do recommend in London.",4,2024,10,15
120,Cold cold room!,I would love yo give this hotel 5 however i cant. Its a 2. The room was cold for 3 days!  The final day we couldnt take it. Called the front desk they sent maintenance who said your heat needs to be reset and filter cleaned. I immediately thanked him and reported the updated solution to the front desk. They did not provide a credit of any portion if our 987gbp. I had a man in my ceiling at midnight and the front desk told me i should have told them. I dont do maintenance i dont change filters that is the Hilton responsibility. I am a personal and business traveller and although polite in their response. A credit for dealing with a cold badly filtered room should be credited not breakfast. Very disappointed.,2,2024,10,14
120,Best customer service,"Had a lovely stay over the weekend 
Aman I believe I’m taking the right name checked me in 
He was so soft spoken and nice I would give him 10/10 for the customer service 
Another girl bhavna was also nice and served with great customer service 
Thank you !",5,2024,10,14
120,"Best French 75 Cocktail, great location, lovely staff.","This was the perfect place to explore the South Bank from. The barman makes the best French 75s I have ever tasted, the concierge staff are so kind and helpful. The pool is long enough to have a decent swim and my bed was so comfortable I didn’t want to get out of it!
The Tate Modern is just steps away, Borough Market is 10 mins walk and just has to be visited.",5,2024,10,12
120,Great hotel and amazing Doorman,The stay was so pleasant. The doorman named Daniel was so hospitable and kind. He helped me thoroughly when I forgot my purse after checkout.

120,Amazing staff! Lovely hotel💕,Receptionist nas welcomed as warmly and made the start of our day amazing. The breakfast is the most relaxed breakfast we ever had in hotels..

120,Always enjoyable.,"Always nice to stay at this hotel, staff are always friendly and professional with clean and tidy rooms, breakfast and bar options available, and a big thankyou to Aman on the front desk for always making my stays welcoming, he's a credit to the Hilton company.",5,2024,10,08

Amen at checkin was helpful, and Yen & Terence in the lounge were great in the evening!",5,2024,10,02
120,Enjoyable last night in London.,Sita our wonderful Neplese waitess engaged with us and made us feel very special.  We had a fun night with the added enjoyment Sita brought to our evening.  Was a wonderful last night in London and look doward to teturing in the neaf future!!!!!,5,2024,10,01
120,Top notch family experience,"We are currently staying at the Hilton London Bankside, and this hotel certainly does not disappoint. They have made the experience of traveling with our two young-ish sons (11 and 7) quite delightful. The welcome amenity for the children was one of a kind...the gift bag and fox toy were extra special. We had excellent service in the executive lounge from Terence and Riyaz. They never let our glasses go empty and were extremely welcoming. The location is great...easy walk to many places. If you're hesitating at all to book...don't! Hilton Bankside is quite the gem!",5,2024,09,30
120,Great lounge,"The hotel lounge provided excellent service, with Riyaz and Luthfuy standing out for their professionalism and warm hospitality. Highly recommended! The area surrounding the hotel and the hotel itself is also fantastic! Next time I will come with my wife.",5,2024,09,30

120,Top stay,One of the best hotel in the City. Warmly welcomed by Daniel at the door and looked until last minute of stay. Strongly recommend for tourists and families. Room was spacious and clean with all comfort needed.The underground swimming pool was warm and clean.,5,2024,09,29
120,"Great service, Great location","JOHN KORTENRAY (Head Concierge) Was professional, prompt, and helpful.  I needed to grab a few last-minute souvenirs before leaving for the airport. He gave me great guidance and then assisted me with putting everything safely into my luggage. He made arrangements for transportation to the tube and provided excellent direction on taking the train to the airport.
All of the hotel staff I interacted with during my stay were efficient and kind.",5,2024,09,28
120,My Home when in London,"I came to the Hilton London Bankside 2 times this year and have been here the past 2 years. It is my home when I come to London. It truly is a wonderful place to stay. I cannot say anything bad about any one that works here. but I want to send my grateful thanks to the Executive lounge employees, 
Terence and Riyaz for being so attentive to me and every other guest that goes there.  
I don’t have all the names of all the others memorized that I enter act with on each day, but without them this hotel would not be so very special to me.",5,2024,09,27
120,Ask for Daniel the doorman,"Fantastic hotel. Great location. Comfortable rooms and great amenities. But the best were the people. So happy to greet us and help us throughout our stay. Everyone from the team at breakfast to the front desk staff were fantastic.  We also enjoyed the executive lounge as Diamond members. Ask for Daniel, the evening doorman. He greeted us like long lost relatives and was genuinely happy we were there. Engaging. Observant.  Caring. Knowledgeable. Professional. Definitely coming back to the Bankside Hilton next time we are in London.",5,2024,09,27
120,Modern hotel in the Bankside District!,"So far, this has been a great experience.  Nice treatment as a Diamond Hilton Honors person, but more so, terrific staff hospitality and very nice accommodations. Very good service at Breakfast (gourmet muffins, omelets, etc.) and in the exec lounge. The hotel is convenient to the Thames and St. Pauls Cathedral.  Thank you to Yen and Riya and everyone!",5,2024,09,26
120,Lounge,Yen and Riyaz were phenomenal! Their friendliness and service was out of this world. They make the experience at this hotel worth it. The entire staff have been super friendly and the hotel is super clean and better than any other London hotel I’ve stayed at. The room sizes are also big!  Thank you!,5,2024,09,26
120,This hotel was a SOLID 10!,"This hotel was immaculate but what really blew me away was the service. Everywhere we went and everyone we encountered was extra friendly and willing to give us suggestions and plenty of friendly chatter. I have to mention the fabulous bar tender who made me a special drink that he had never made. Ask him for a cucumber martini. Sita and Susie were my highlight at the hotel bar. They went over and beyond for us and were so much fun to see everyday.  The concierge manager was simply amazing and made sure everything was taken care of each day. . Kamal and Daniel booked all the things I wanted to do in advance  via e-mail so it was nice to finally meet them.  Lastly, I want to thank Mirco from room service to say how amazing it was to meet and chat with you. It was a pleasure to see you each evening. The hotel is beyond clean, stylish, and has an indoor pool. We walked everywhere and it was conveniently located close to all the sites we wanted to visit. You won’t be disappointed in Bankside!",5,2024,09,25
120,Bankside For the Win,"Really enjoyed our stay at the Hilton London Bankside. Hotel is sleek and modern and ultra clean. Staff are outstanding- friendly and helpful and make you feel very welcome. The breakfast buffet is plentiful and quality is excellent (although it could use a little more variety in day to day fare). The rooms are spacious, well-appointed and very quiet. Beds are super comfy. Special shoutout to Ricardo in The Distillery bar who went above and beyond helping us with our cell phone problems, navigating the area and supplying us with much-needed coffee on day one; Daniel the doorman and the fantastic Concierge team who kept us charged when our adapter failed. Lots of convenience stores on the block and some good restaurants within walking distance. Tate Modern is right down the street and Borough Market is an easy walk. Tube stops are not too far. Location-wise I prefer Westminster for the proximity to tourist spots and walkability but you would be paying much more in a Westminster location for the 5 star quality you get with Bankside.",5,2024,09,24
120,Relaxing,"The staff including Coumba were excellent, the seating was comfortable and the ambience was relaxing and there was an alcohol free beer 😊 convenient location. The chips were well made. I didn’t try the toilets so can’t comment on this. Would visit again",4,2024,09,23
120,Hilton Bankside,"Lovely nice and clean hotel,staff are very enthusiastic to help you, everytime you walk past the check in staff always greet you ,
Pool and gym is excellent 
Executive lounge is beautiful the food is always high quality and delicious, interior is so nice 
Staff so helpful always keep your glass topped up at happy hour 
Breakfast is excellent so much choice

120,Excellent london break. ,"This was first time at hotel ,and we found it excellent. 

The location is a good base to visit Southbank,Tate modern and Borough market and all easy to walk to.  We got a good friendly welcome off reception staff and we had two adjacent rooms ,which were very  spacious and comfortable. 
We visited the Executive lounge  and found it excellent ,from the very friendly staff and great service with a good choice of snacks and drinks.
 We all enjoyed the breakfast at the Oxbo restaurant, with a fantastic selection of lovely food and all staff very friendly and professional. 
The hotel is in a nice area and only a small distance from Southwark tube station and only 10 minutes walk to London bridge station for train to Brighton .  
Overall it was a great stay at hotel and we will be back soon.
",5,2024,09,21
120,"Daniel the doorman, foxes and food!","This hotel is close to so much, and easy walking distance to a lot. The hotel has a fox theme and they asked our kids ages before we arrived and reached out several times via email, which I have never experience with all my years of being an honors member. 

The kids received fox themes blankets pillows and a small stuffed animal fox. They were able to keep the small fox! They also had kids bathrobe and activity books for them as well! 

The food was fantastic, but the best service came from Daniel the doorman who helped my sick mother in law to her room when she was alone and light headed arriving by cab. The staff worked to find her nearby treatment and scheduled it. Best Hilton by far in all my travels! 

The people made the experience! Daniel greeted us multiple times a day for 4 days!",5,2024,09,21
120,Great Room Service,"Got served by Miro for a late night room service. Really great! Got the club sandwich without tomatoes and it was so good. I got a whole table delivered to my room!

Miro was extremely friendly. After a long cancelled train it was nice to be met with such welcoming people.",5,2024,09,20
120,Conference quality!,"Fabulous conferencing facilities - very helpful, professional and attentive staff. 
Great bedroom and nice and straightforward. I travel alot and sometimes hotels get over complicated with bedrooms and lights and goodness knows what. Very much a quality establishment!!",5,2024,09,19
120,JUST  GREAT,"Everyone just couldn't do enough for us. In particular SITO D in the bar was outstanding and made us very welcome. Loved all the pillows I will get some for ourselves.  Love the security in lift and door entry. 

All carpets were modern and clean. Would suggestive carpet at the centre of the checking in area be replaced, well worn .",5,2024,09,16
120,Highly recommend,Service was superb. Rooms were well accommodated. Concierge service was extremely helpful and so amazing. Provided great information and transportation assistance.   Restaurant and bar were top-notch. All staff were friendly and helpful.,5,2024,09,14
120,Wonderful stay at Hilton London Bankside.,"We had a wonderful stay at the Hilton London Bankside! We arrived a little before check in and Amen was able to get us into a room right away. As diamond members she upgraded us to a suite with a living area. The room was beautiful and spacious. Housekeeping came every day and also completed a turndown service in the evenings. The breakfast in OXBO had so many options from waffles, pancakes, cooked to order omelettes, pastries, fruit, boiled eggs, charcuterie, and more. Mursal and Daniel helped us to get a car to the airport with a fixed rate and kindly loaded all of our luggage. One older gentleman (who I cannot remember his name) was so nice to our daughter and greeted her every morning. He also gave her a toy fox which she loves. Overall a great hotel! We will come back for the exceptional customer service and hospitality.",5,2024,09,14
120,Amazing Staff,"The staff were all very enthusiastic to assist my wife and I with any questions that we had. Daniel the Doorman was very friendly and helpful, and made us smile each time we walked into the lobby. The breakfast was very good and had a it of options. I would recommend anyone staying in London to stay at this location.",5,2024,09,13
120,Great London Location and Great Service,"Excellent service, food & lodging …. Mursal, Zhan, Joseph, Amen stood out as we stayed here for a week.  They helped us with tours , taxis, restaurants, and smiles every day.  The breakfast is excellent and the bar has good beers on draft.  The hotel is in walking distance to train, bus or even sites on foot.  We would certainly stay here again.",5,2024,09,12
120,Disappointing Treatment Despite Loyalty Status,"As a Hilton Gold member, I had high expectations for my stay at the Hilton London Bankside. Unfortunately, my experience has been far from the welcoming and accommodating service I’m used to with Hilton.

Since I booked my stay through a third party (Booking.com), it’s almost as if my status doesn’t even exist. Every time I’ve requested anything related to my room, the staff have been noticeably standoffish and made me feel unwelcome. Rather than addressing my needs with the courtesy I expect, there’s been a consistent lack of warmth and willingness to assist.

This attitude is particularly disappointing considering Hilton’s usual standards for customer service. While I understand third-party bookings may not receive all the same benefits, it should not justify dismissive treatment or an unwelcoming atmosphere.

I hope the hotel will reconsider how they treat loyal Hilton customers, regardless of how the booking is made.",2,2024,09,11
120,Great Hotel with good service and location near all the main sites; Executive Lounge is worth it to relax day & night,"This hotel is located in a perfect location to enjoy the London Eye, Big Ben, Westminster Abbey, British Museum, Chinatown, and all the other excursions we signed-up for.  We almost reserved at Marriott at Grosvernor and was so glad we booked Hilton Bankside. The location allowed us to be minutes away from London sites.  We reserved a King Executive Suite connected with Two Double Beds with Executive Lounge Access.  The connecting rooms was worth it for the family! 

Service as phenomenal!  Danielle Doorman was so wonderful as he greeted us daily each time we returned for a day of tours.  Elena who is a group event manager was exceptional. With the confusion of the multiple rooms booked through 3rd parties who didn’t get our rooms correct, Elena came in to cancel, adjust, and help us on the spot during arrival.  The concierge service was exceptional, providing us daily taxis and helping us with dinner reservations and bookings. 

Perks such as the Executive Lounge was a great way to relax, enjoy breakfast, get daily refreshments, and most of all … enjoy the canapés after a long day. Breakfast was always simple with scrambled eggs, bacon, and other sides (oatmeal, cereal, nuts, etc).  On some days, we enjoyed the regular OXBO restaurant next door which provided an amazing variety of waffles, eggs, bacon, omelets, fries, congee, oatmeal, fruits, pastries, bread, and much more.  Having the Executive Lounge allowed us to enjoy both the restaurant for breakfast or a quiet place for breakfast.  We enjoyed the restaurant much more for the variety of food to serve the family taste buds.    While we stayed 10 days, the only recommendation i would make is to ensure there is more variation than 3 options that rotated daily:  1) Beef in Gravy w/Noodles, 2) Indian Samosa and Vegetarian curry, and 3) grilled chicken thighs with gnocchi.  I would have expected some other variations to accommodate families.  We enjoyed Terence and Lutfer’s hospitality and service at the executive lounge.  The refreshments of unlimited water, tea, coffee/latte/espresso/mocha, coke, lemon soda, and other beverages plus crackers was worth getting Executive Lounge.",5,2024,09,08
120,MAJOR CONSTRUCTION,"BEWARE--the hotel is undergoing an extension by adding multiple floors to the roof. The associated construction noise is VERY loud and there is no indication of construction prior to booking. Had I known the hotel was under construction, I WOULD NOT HAVE STAYED HERE. 

I find it extremely deceitful that there is no indication of the construction when booking this hotel and I was extremely disappointed when I arrived as I was unable to rest due to the noise. Further, the construction continues during working hours on weekdays, so DO NOT stay at this hotel if you have any expectation of peace.",2,2024,09,07
120,Great experience,Experience was very good. Staff were excellent and kind. The room was clean and the bed was very comfortable. Reception was very helpful and answered quick when I had queries. Breakfast was always on time. Mursal was especially helpful at the door.,5,2024,09,06
120,Great experience,"As Honors member, I enjoyed my stay at the hotel. Very good amenities and excellent service. The staff were pleasant and helpful, Mursal was exceptionally great, brightened every morning with his radiant smile.
True to the Hilton experience!",5,2024,09,06
120,Modern Gem,"Great comfortable beds, quiet hallways, immaculate pool that was the right temperature and lovely to swim in after a day of traveling. Great breakfast selection but what made it special was your great people from Daniel the doorman to your front desk staff. Well done everyone",5,2024,09,03
120,Feedback on Sita - Restaurant and Bar staff at Hilton Bankside,"The staff at the Hilton Bankside are very helpful. There was a particular waitress called Sita Devji who was very courteous and went above and beyond to ensure that we were taken care of with regard to drinks and food.

Very pleasant hotel with a nice relaxed vibe",5,2024,09,02
120,Excellent again,Excellent as always - stayed here so many times and always love ut! Every staff member is helpful from the moment you approach the lovely spacious foyer area (always full of beautiful plants and flowers) right through to breakfast. This time I can with my mum and sister and I arrived well before them and before check in but Nasser greeted me like a kind polite old friend taking care of my luggage and sorting out room.  All staff behave in this way. It’s more expensive than some other Hiltons but worth the treat. Location to sights is excellent too.,5,2024,09,02
120,My favorite hotel in London.,"Another wonderful stay at the Hilton London Bankside, (my third in the past year). Great location and easy access to two underground stations. Special thanks to the Guest Relations Manager Nasser and his great customer service.  I look forward to my next stay.",5,2024,09,01
120,"Wonderful experience, exceptional service!","We went to The Distillery which was adjacent to and part of the hotel. My wife and I stopped in for a few pints and our server, Shubhankar was so personable and professional we opted to stay for dinner. He assisted with our meal selection and was extremely attentive to our needs. The surroundings were beautiful, clean and comfortable. The meal was excellent and his service never wavered from exceptional. I wish we could have stayed in London longer to experience it again.",5,2024,09,01
120,Wonderful Southbank Property behind Tate Modern!,"Excellent property in a fantastic location - highly recommended! Generally would prefer it for a London hotel - best to fly into LCY for it. Heathrow also works but can be complicated with the connections on the Tube. Otherwise, well managed hotel with a nice bar and decent food.",5,2024,09,01
120,Amazing waitress called Sita,"we came for few drinks while passing through. Sita was our waitress . She was amazing! went out of her way to make sure we were well look after and we had a lovely conversation with her! She was such sweetheart and deserves some sort of promotion, - Ania, Maya, Mark, Oscar",5,2024,08,31
120,Stay here!!!!,"The most amazing experience ever!! I loved everything about this place. What an amazing service from all the staff in the front desk and also at the executive lounge, valet and restaurant. Speaking of the executive lounge wow wow wow they actually have amazing food here! I highly recommend anybody to stay here! I liked it so much that I stayed an additional night thanks to Zuzana in the front desk! I’ll be back for sure!!!",5,2024,08,31
120,"Good hotel with a decent pool, but pricey","Generally a pretty good stay - mainly stay here for the pool, which you don't often see. The gym area, though small, is well organised. The rooms are a good size and, bar one stay I had earlier this year, very clean. 

Lots of options at breakfast, and the location is pretty useful.",4,2024,08,30
120,First dinner in london,Sita danyi was very friendly as well as helpful with our dinner choices. She went above and beyond explaining the many choices on our menu. Had a wonderful and affordable dinner. Why must i do 200 characters for a review...you need to change this,5,2024,08,30
120,Great stay for sightseeing,"Stayed 10 nights for sightseeing.  Hotel is a great building and in a great location.  Convenient to several tube stations with short walks.   Lots of good restaurants and convenience stores nearby.   Short walk or bus ride to the Borough market and London Bridge area. 

The executive lounge had great service each night.  Yen and Terence are great and attentive to the guests needs.  

Desk staff at check in and any time we needed them were friendly and very helpful.  

I’ll stay here again, no question",5,2024,08,29
120,Another Great Stay at Bankside,"This hotel has got it figured out. Staff is ready and willing to help, rooms are extra clean and the location next to Tate Modern and the Globe theater is fantastic. Extra props to Riyaz in the Executive Lounge, where full breakfast and evening snacks are served daily. We'll be back.",5,2024,08,29
120,Excellent ,"My second stay at this hotel and this was even better than the first. Great location beside the Tate Modern, close to Southwark tube and Blackfriars station.
The staff are just excellent, so friendly and enthusiastic about what they do. A special shout out to the staff in the executive lounge, the Italian guy, sorry didn't get your name, so much pride in what you do along with the rest of the guys working there. Breakfast is excellent, the omelette chef made us a beautiful breakfast each morning. 
I stay with Hilton monthly and this was right up there. Well done ",5,2024,08,28
120,Great experience,Lovely experience. Loved the welcome Proseco. The fabulous swimming pool - warm water. Thanks to the amazing  team especially Joseph and Sam. Great food at Oxbo restaurant. Will come again especially as it had a great location near Southbank.,5,2024,08,27
120,Fantastic,"We have stayed in London many many times and this was one of the best hotels we have stayed in!!

The rooms were fantastic and extremely modern, bars and food were top!!

But, service was the thing that really did it for us. From the moment we arrived the service was exceptional. 

Sam on the desk could not do more for us, he was fantastic.  The guys on consierge did everything for us and nothing was an issue. 
The manager in reception could not be more welcoming and accommodating.  And finally there was a waitress in the distillery who was amazing and equally great with our daughter!!

We will be returning",5,2024,08,26
120,Fine and Friendly Hotel,"I stayed with my family at Hilton Banskide for a week. Begnning with a cheery greeting, lots of help with heavy luggage and refreshing prosecco and water from Daniel the Doorman after a long, tiring journey, the hotel was a comfortable, clean, modern and pleasant refuge thoughout our stay. The staff was consistently friendly, patient and very helpful and really made this very nice hotel even more pleasurable. The breakfast room  was busy but never too crowded, the food fresh and with lots of variety. We had access to the executve lounge which had cold drinks and coffee all day, as well as delicious appetizers in the evening. The staff in the lounge was very friendy and helpful. The rooms were clean and comfortable, with clean, modern  bathrooms, comfy robes, and a large work desk and plenty of outlets for all our devices. I could go and on.

We frequent London every year or two and will be back next Spring, but for us there is only one obvious choice for lodgings - Hilton Bankside. It will make your time in London very pleasurable.",5,2024,08,24
120,Great staff,"I stayed on the 4th August with my wife and 2 kids. It was an amazing stay. The facilities, breakfast, and staff were incredible. Every single staff member was polite and cheerful. Great selection for breakfast. Executive lounge was a good treat. All staff were great but special mention on the reception staff Merkyla and Annabell. John from concierge and Ali, the breakfast chef. We will definitely visit again.",5,2024,08,23
120,An exquisite place for classy drinks,"The bar has a very cosy atmosphere. Over the two times ive went there didnt try any food however the drinks were excellent! As in very likely the best ive ever had.
My bartender was Ashok for both evenings and besides being a very pleasant person he really put effort into making sure every flavor of every drink was exactly as its supposed to be for providing the best experience and taste. 

In addition to that, another outstanding aspect must be mentioned - the bar is partially supplied by their own brewery. They’ve refined in my opinion a near perfect recipe for their brand lager which is honestly one of if not the best ive ever had. Also the gin from the brewery is very savoury and has a gentle kick to it. Would recommend anyone visiting to give it a try.",5,2024,08,22
120,People make all the difference,Stayed with work and family. Great service from Keya on reception sorting the family room requirements. And great lounge with a friendly and personal reception and service from Yen. Great atmosphere throughout and excellent breakfast choices.,5,2024,08,21

120,Summer family trip,"Stayed at the hotel with my son from 13th to 15th August. Reception were welcoming and friendly, and as a diamond member we were upgraded to a family twin room which was lovely, and had a separate seating area with sofa. 

I didn’t use the executive lounge this time, but I did have breakfast on both days and the omelette which I ordered with the chef was excellent. The breakfast is a good quality selection.

Thank you for another great stay.",5,2024,08,20
120,Diamond Place,"Great Hotel & excellent staff and they just keep getting better on every stay.
Fantastic for families or business alike & they make you feel most welcome.
Restaurant & Bar are first class as is the Executive Lounge.
I am a lifetime Diamond member and have just completed a world tour which included many 5 star Hiltons & Conrads and I can confirm that the Bankside Hotel is up there with the leading ones.

The staff are really fantastic & too many to name here, individually, but special thanks to Joshua, Ricardo, Sita & Kim.

Don't take my word for it, go stay & try for yourself.",5,2024,08,17

From Ali's omelettes to Yen's Gins - never a dull moment!  John and Daniel front of house will get you where you need to be!",5,2024,08,15
120,Another great visit,"Another great few days in the Bankside. WIth Yin in the executive lounge attentive as usual, Ali & Daniel in the restaurant for breakfast cooking up a storm and John and Daniel in the foyer keeping everything in ship shape, its always a pleasure to come back to the Bankside",5,2024,08,15
120,A Gem!! My new go to hotel in London!,"The Hilton Bankside was a dream hotel. They present the best hotel staff I have ever encountered (including all the bigger, ""fancier"" hotels) I have stayed with.  Check-in here was easy. They had plenty of staff and my women (I think Mylikah) gave me a very thorough briefing of what to expect and a rundown on all the services. The bed and the bedding itself was of the highest quality. The room was quiet, well lighted, insulated for sound, with great closets and a very nice, modern shower.

Breakfast was excellent, dinners were excellent and the terrace and happy hours were generous, with stylish, comfortable seating and a great covered terrace. I had the best servers out on the terrace (one exceptional young Nepalese woman who really made happy hour happy.  

There is a top notch weight and treadmill room (24 hours), as well as a beautifully maintained pool area (0600 to 2200). The hotel is two steps from the Tate Modern and a wide range of convenience shopping and other shops. I had some treatments at O'Sullivan's beauty salon a three minute walk away and was very pleased.

Otherwise, the whole Bankside area presents a great neighborhood, with super easy links to the metro. A fifteen minute walk to Waterloo station, the Thames, the London Eye, etc.

This is my go to hotel from now on. I visit London several times a year and I am so happy to have found this bright, professional hotel with its exceptional staff. Congratulations to the management. This is the friendliest Hilton I have ever been to.",5,2024,08,14
120,Lovely stay!,"I had a lovely stay at Hilton Bankside. We booked the King bed room and had plenty of space for 2. The room was very comfortable and clean. Bathroom was clean and spotless. 

The hotel is located very close to Tate Modern and the Southwark underground station. Loads of cafes and restaurants around the area.

Mursal was very kind and helpful to assist us with our luggages.",5,2024,08,14
120,Excellent hotel and location,"Excellent hotel and location to key sites, Shard and Borough Market. Staff has been outstanding from check in to the restaurant and drinks at the bar. Ask for Sita D. at the refiner for outstanding service in the hotel bar, the refinery! Entire staff has been top notch.",5,2024,08,13
120,Spacious Bar at The Distillery,"Good place for drinks, catch up and chill. 
The environment is fresh, relaxing music, plenty of space. I would like to recommend this place if you want to hang out with friends or for bussiness meetings. There is also a lovely outdoor area. Enjoy!",5,2024,08,13
120,Great chilled bar,"The bar was very chilled and had a lovely nice relaxed vibe,  in between the hustle and bustle of London bridge and Tate modern. Coumbo the waitress was very attentive nice and considerate. We enjoyed our time here, we'll locate well litten area",5,2024,08,12
120,Beautiful,"We had a lot of fun. Our waitress was very friendly and cool. 
The drinks was tasty.
The ambiente was really nice too

Summarize the restaurant is one of our best in london. We are tourists and it is our first day in london. We recommend this restaurant to everyone",5,2024,08,12
120,Perfect and right downstairs,"My family and I stayed at the Hilton - Bankside. The restaurant was down stairs.  On the second day after a long day of site seeing, we decided to stay and eat at the hotel. Food was good.  The Tosta Mista and BLT was perfect.  Not too heavy but filling. Cocktails were properly made.  Service was great.  Thanks Shubhanitar for great service",5,2024,08,11
120,Amazing stay!,"We are on day one of our trip and after a very long day of travel, the team at the Hilton London Bankside, have gone bout of their way to meet our needs! From the moment we pulled up, a kind gentleman greeted us and helped us with options for parking, quickly took our luggage and hosted us into the hotel. Then a lovely young lady greeted us and was very kind and friendly and so personable and professional. All through the hotel, the team greeted us and asked how they could help. Another kind gentleman took our things to the room and made sure we were settled. Then the kindest moment occurred. My wife's travel fan blew and we were worried about not having it and I called downstairs to see where in the area I could find one, and instantly the concierge gentleman, said no worries, we have one and we will bring it up for you to test it out, it was perfect! Then I went for a coffee and was greeted by the manager who told me to have a seat and the gentlemen would take care of my cappuccino. I sat and had a lovely conversation with Shubhanrav and Ashor and my coffee was AMAZING!! Then back to the room and shortly after, a wonderful lady tapped on the door to ask if she could help me with turndown service! I travel often, and I like to stay in high end hotels! In all of my travels, my favorite has been the Four Seasons in Philadelphia, PA which is a really amazing experience! Well I have a new favorite!! Only hours into my stay and the team at the Hilton Bankside have become my #1 travel favorite. The room and the hotel is beautiful, but the staff here is the real gem. There kindness and concern has made me feel so welcomed! You usually see this kind of elevated service in one or two staff members, well here you fine it in every corner of this hotel! Truly amazing!",5,2024,08,09
120,Executive Lounge,"Hilton Bankside executive lounge is fantastic and the customer service offered by Yen, Terrence and Luther is superb!!!  The offerings at both break and dinner are extensive and delicious!!!  The lounge is comfortable, well appointed and extremely relaxing!!!",5,2024,08,08
120,Outstanding hotel,"Yen was such a joy and provided wonderful service in executive lounge. My family and I had a wonderful stay! The hotel was in perfect condition, and it provided a wonderful experience for our holiday. I would highly recommend the Bankside for business or personal travel.",5,2024,08,08
120,Worth a vist!,"Hilton Bankside was really great and experience. The staff was courteous polite helpful and very professional. The staff at the OXBO restaurant was really good especially Sita Dangi, very thoughtful and welcoming. Five stars to the hotel and the restaurant.",5,2024,08,06
120,A Great Choice for a London Hotel,"The Hilton Bankside is a lovely, fresh and modern hotel in an area that we found quiet and safe. The soundproofed rooms made for peaceful sleeping and the room had everything we needed including an ironing board. Plenty of plug sockets although the room could benefit from brighter lighting. Reception staff and concierge were all helpful and very pleasant. Sadly there was no room in the hotel carpark for our car but we could unload and load the car right outside the hotel. I've docked a point for service in the breakfast room. On the first day not one of our finished plates were removed while we were there - there were 5 of us and the table got pretty cramped. I thought there may be a better selection of freshly prepared breakfast items like an eggs benedict  or eggs royal and the fresh fruit options were also limited, but thats personal taste, I guess. That said, everything available looked fresh and tasty. I wouldn't hesitate to recommend the Hilton Bankside and hope to return when next in London.",4,2024,08,06
120,Fantastic,"Fantastic hotel, we stay every time we go to London and wouldn’t stay anywhere else. 
Beautiful interior.
Great Location.
Amazing staff,  very welcoming and attentive.
Yen and Domenico were lovely in the Executive Lounge and really looked after us. 
Everyone always goes above and beyond. 
Cannot recommend more!",5,2024,08,06
120,"Overall - comfortable, pleasant stay with good design, services!","My partner and I had a comfortable, pleasant stay at this hotel. Location was great for use of public transport and walking during our stay. We appreciated the modern design,  cleanliness, good amenities (ample electrical ports, USB, mini fridge, iron, etc.)  in the room. Staff members were friendly and efficient, too -- even at one point accommodating our special request for an added chair in the room. The pool and fitness facilities were top-notch -- magical when we caught some time there without any other guests interrupting us! We had only a couple of minor suggestions for management to consider: The rooms are far too dark with very limited lighting options. I would add a good lamp somewhere because just opening the curtains during the day also does not work well when you are in a section of the hotel with windows facing other hotel room windows that are only about 25' away (estimated) and we felt uncomfortable relaxing or dressing with the curtains open. Also, we are vegan and when we looked at the dining options in the hotel, we were disappointed to see how few, unappetizing choices we had, so we ended up avoiding both venues altogether.  London itself was very vegan and PB-friendly, though, so that was fabulous but also a stark contrast to the hotel's offerings.  A final suggestion, minor but meaningful:  Free coffee supplies and an electric pot are offered in the room, but no alternatives to cow's milk. Other hotels we have stayed at have offered oat milk packets or non-dairy creamer along with the coffee supplies.  When we called down to ask about this, staff members told us they could not provide non-dairy alternatives to use the coffee amenities without charging us 5 pounds a day. That response seemed to mar what was otherwise a guest-centered experience. I would probably return to this hotel the next time we're in London, but would look for more vegan-friendly options before doing that, TBH, unless this part is reconsidered at the Hilton London Bankside.",4,2024,08,05
120,An ideal venue for an off-site meeting,"I can't recommend this hotel highly enough. We often use it for business meetings and it never disappoints. There is such a friendly tone in reception when you arrive and the staff all make you feel really welcome. 
On this occasion, we were there for a team day and we enjoyed a late lunch in the main restaurant (great choice of food and delicious options) and finished the afternoon in the outside area of the bar with a few rounds of drinks and table tennis  which was great fun for everyone. Well done to all the team at Bankside - they really do a great job and I look forward to returning soon.",5,2024,08,05
120,"Great hotel, best in class in everything- location, room and facilities, staff and restaurant.","This is one of the best hotels I have stayed at. Hotel is centrally located, neighborhood feels very safe, and several shops and restaurants within walking distance. Hotel is in impeccable condition, rooms were clean with everything working well, breakfast buffet was excellent (very complete, wide variety of food items) and the Executive lounge simply amazing. More importantly, hotel staff were courteous, friendly and willing to go the extra mile to make sure our stay was a very pleasant experience. I would highlight everyone at the front desk and Mursal at the front entrance.",5,2024,08,05
120,Excellent stay,"We had a fantastic time in London, and Hilton Bankside was our HQ for the stay. This is an upscale hotel that ticks off on everything. The reception was very welcoming and we got to our room as requested. The included breakfast was good, but a bit lacking for a 5-star.",4,2024,08,04
120,Excellent service,We had a great experience at the distillery Bankside lounge our waitress Sita Dangi was fantastic with us and extremely patient and kind to my elderly parent's helping them with their order. It made our experience a lot more meaningful! We will certainly return,5,2024,08,04
120,Service,"Excellent service by the team had a really good dinner served at the restaurant and the pleasant atmosphere provided by Sita Dangi .
Lovely lady great knowledge about the food and recommended us to try the steak definitely worth it . Would surely suggest a visit",5,2024,08,04
120,Sita Dangi - outstanding service,"I would like to extend my heartfelt praise to Sita Dangi for providing exceptional waiting service and creating a brilliant dining experience at the restaurant. Her attention to detail, warm hospitality, and impeccable professionalism made our visit truly memorable. Sita's dedication to ensuring our comfort and satisfaction did not go unnoticed, and her friendly demeanor added a personal touch that enhanced our overall experience. Thank you, Sita, for your outstanding service!",5,2024,08,04
120,Very nice folks! Very nice place!,"The staff is exceptionally friendly and helpful. From start to finish! Our check in with (pardon, my spelling) Sandeep (sorry!) was friendly and efficient. The concierge, Kamaal, provided us lots and lots of good information. We also enjoyed some good pints and some very good whiskeys recommended by Shashank and Ashok at the bar. Truly, it didn’t feel like you were in a hotel bar, rather, more like being at your friend’s house and they share a good find with you. Do you know they have their very own lager, which is as pure as it gets with some bright notes, and even their own gin! This was just such a very nice stay, made special by especially nice folks.",5,2024,08,03
120,Great getaway,"Huge rooms, outstanding staff members, really nice brunch included with our Hilton Honors membership.

Sean in the pool, slept well in the client and air conditioned room, and walked to the great Burroughs market.

Daniel the Doorman was very helpful and always asked if we needed anything and what he could do.

Thank you for this lovely stay on our anniversary!",5,2024,08,02
120,Always perfect and looked after brilliantly,I stay here regularly and all of the staff are incredible at making you feel at home.

120,"Great hotel, even better service.","Lovely Hotel; I’ve been going to Hilton hotels for over 30 years. 

In particular, what a great service from the lovely Sita Dangi, warm, attentive, friendly and responsive. She deserves the recognition I’m giving her now, and as a result of her service, I will return. Thank you Sita.",5,2024,07,29

120,Wonderful stay at Hilton London Bankside!,"As we entered the hotel we were greeted by name! Top notch Hilton hotel. One of the best in the world! Our room on the third floor was very quiet and comfortable with robes and slippers provided. We are Diamond Hilton Honors members so we were able to enter the Executive Lounge. Great service in the lounge, nice range of drinks and food. The breakfast buffet was very delicious every morning. So many choices!!! The location on the south bank was very convenient to walk to the London Eye area to catch our tours from. We also walked with our carryon to the Waterloo Station to take the train to Southampton to catch our cruise on the Celebrity Apex. Thank you Hilton Bankside! We had a wonderful four nights in London before our cruise. Plus we took the Elizabeth line from Heathrow to Bond Station and then the Tube on the Jubilee line to Southwark station, then walked to the hotel. I had never been to London before, but it was super easy by train to the hotel.",5,2024,07,27
120,Just Book It,"We just returned from a week in London, and the Bankside Hotel was our incredible home base. We requested two adjoining rooms as our kids are older, and this exceeded our expectations. The rooms are set up off a small hallway and can be reserved separately or together. When reserved together, there is a door, with key card access, that is able to be closed to prevent others from accessing the small hallway. One room is a double twin and one a king room. Both are large and have plenty of room to move around and have lovely, new bathrooms. Everything was super clean and well cared for. Housekeeping was very attentive, and we also were left afternoon treats a couple times during our visit. The indoor pool and fitness facilities are both great. The pool is large and accommodates quite a few people at a time. Not the tiny, standard indoor hotel pool you often find but large. The one and only complaint is that the plug in the bathroom is two prong when all hair appliances (including the hotel’s hair dryer … which was a very good hair dryer), and adaptors are three prong so you have to fix your hair outside your bathroom. But this is likely a code issue so it probably can’t be changed. Otherwise no other complaints. 

As far as location, some have said it was out of the action, but it is a quick tube ride to anything and everything you could possibly want to access. Not to mention you are minutes from the Thames and all the restaurants that run along the riverbank. And it is nice and quiet at the end of the day. We didn’t have a chance to visit the hotel restaurant, but we had breakfast at The Table just around the corner a couple times and there is an Amazon store just across the street if you need any snacks. 

This is a five star hotel with five star service and definitely worth booking.",5,2024,07,26
120,"Modern, sleek hotel with great service","Absolutely fantastic stay at the Hilton London Bankside! From the moment we arrived, we were treated to impeccable service. A special shoutout to Mursal, the exceptional concierge, who went above and beyond to valet park our car and check our luggage effortlessly. His professionalism and friendly demeanor set the tone for a perfect visit. Highly recommend!",5,2024,07,26
120,Mursal was awesome!,"Mursal was amazing and always assisted and went beyond his role to help find local things to enjoy and partake in.

We enjoyed our stay at Hilton Bankside as accommodations were more than enough and the food was great! Thank you for making our London trip feel like home.",5,2024,07,26
120,Great hotel,"Fantastic hotel. The executive lounge is the best I’ve experienced in London. Thank you to Yen and Domenico for looking after us. Really appreciate their attention to detail and to provide excellent customer service….. including a healthy flow of gin and tonics!

The breakfast is also SOOOOOO good here. Love it. Our favourite Hilton Hotel (we stay here every other week or so!).",5,2024,07,23
120,Stunning,"The service is startling. And consistent throughout the trip. (Traveler with wife and two kids - age 6&5)

We arrived after an exhausting flight and Daniel the Doorman took our bags, took the weight away from our travel and continued to make us laugh for the entire trip.  

Mekhyla was so unbelievably friendly and understanding at the front desk check in, and went way above and beyond to make sure that our week was everything we needed.  She recommended and we changed to another room that made a world of a difference. 

As a server, Terence made me and my family feel cared for.  Which is so unusual in a city like London, but we knew that someone cared about us when we came back to the hotel.  I can't explain the value of this for a young family. 

I sincerely recommend this hotel to anyone, and hope you have the experience that me and my family had.",5,2024,07,20
120,Great stay at Hilton South Bank,Excellent stay at the hotel with super service in the Oxbo bar… THE location for any stay in Southwark and the City. Great rooms and sport facilities. Big thank you to Sita Dangi for the great service. You made it a super experience for the whole family and friends.,5,2024,07,20
120,Far exceeded expectations!,"I primarily chose this hotel because of the pool, but once we arrived I realized what a great haven it was for families and I definitely plan to come back. From the convenience of the family suites for a family of 4+, to the special touches just for kids, to the breakfast buffet, to the fantastic location, the Hilton Bankside far exceeded my expectations. The staff, including Mehkyla who checked us in and Mersal who helped with our bags, as well as everyone at the front desk and restaurant, were always friendly and went out of their way to be helpful and bring a smile to our faces. Thank you for such a great experience!",5,2024,07,19
120,Choose another hotel,"I am still wondering how this hotel gets such high reviews.  Here is my side:

1.  Rude/ mean reception.  Our flight on British Airways from US to London was cancelled.  I emailed hotel 4 times with the cancellation attached.  Upon arrival a day later they wanted to charge me for the night I did not stay.  The young lady at the front desk- dark hair / ponytail was so mean and rude.  Would not discuss any alternatives and said you are being charged even though we did not stay.   Ridiculous

2.  Beds are like sleeping on cinder blocks- hard as cement

3.  I had 4 bottles of water that concierge gave me in my room, the cleaning lady removed them. crazy I know.

4.  The views are of AC units and other buildings

5.  The location is so far removed from Central London

6.  PLEASE NOTE- there is on-going construction on the building and there is jackhammering all day long if looking for a nap from jet lag.  We had no idea upon arrival.

Choose another hotel in London .",1,2024,07,17
120,Perfect - no notes,A beautiful hotel in a great location. The hotel and its facilities have obviously had a lot of care and attention to detail in upkeeping it. The commendations most of all go the wonderful staff whose impeccable service made me feel welcome and at home the moment I walked through the door; all smiley and attentive - special shout out to Mikayla who was a bundle of joy and very knowledgeable about the area.,5,2024,07,16
120,Above and beyond!,"This place is amazing! From the fresh smelling lobby to the incredibly helpful and friendly staff, this has to be the best hotel experience we have ever had! We were given a key to the lounge since we are diamond members and when they found out we were celebrating our anniversary they upgraded our accomodations to a beautiful suite! They also went out of their way to help us find our way around the city and change some currency for us! We would come back here on a return trip in a second!",5,2024,07,15
120,A fantastic June stay,"We had two interconnecting rooms and an executive suite at the Hilton bankside for 5 nights in June. We've stayed at many Hiltons across the USA and Europe, and this was one of the best experiences. The staff really make this hotel a cut above the rest. Every employee we met- from Daniel who found us dragging our bags down the street and helped us, to the lovely gentleman who checked us in, to the staff in the breakfast room and executive lounge- nothing was too much trouble. Our kids loved the pool, candy cart and fox hunt. The breakfast spread each morning was excellent. We were easily able to walk to many London attractions, but the hotel was set back from the south bank just enough to escape the crowds. A great stay with no complaints, we won't hesitate to book Hilton Bankside when we return to London.",5,2024,07,15
120,The best place for families,"My family voted this hotel to be the best place to stay during our Eurotrip. The staff were all (no exception) amazing, highlights to the concierge who manage to get a pair of swimming goggles for our kids and Mursal who helped with the luggage and provided compilenrsry water bottles for the airport trip. Facilities are spotless, great pool for family and exercises, breakfast was full of options and the location is perfect - close to several good restaurants, Borough Market and underground/train stations.",5,2024,07,15
120,Amazing experience,"I recently stayed at Hilton london backside and had an exceptional experience. The staff was incredibly welcoming and attentive, ensuring all my needs were met.

120,Incredibly friendly staff that make you feel at home,It always feels like a second home coming back to the Hilton London Bankside. Daniel the doorman always greets me with the warmest smile. And Bhawna at reception is so kind. They both instantly made me feel welcomed and are so personable. I loved how they alway stop to check how you’re doing and have a chat every time they see you. And Coumba at the bar was so helpful. The staff here are incredible and really make your stay that much better. The rooms are great and the bed so comfortable. I can’t wait to visit again soon.,5,2024,07,12
120,Lovely Stay,Excellent location. Two tube stations within a 5/10 min walk. Staff were nice. Lots of food choices near by. Hotel was clean and modern. Buffet breakfast was really good.

120,A great experience at Hilton Bankside.,"The Hilton Bankside has exceptional service. You are greeted and asked throughout your stay if all is as expected. The rooms are large and modern and the executive room is excellent. One of the best and we have been to many all over the world. We must praise the doorman, Joseph, as when we left after a week staying there our booked driver (not through the Hilton) did not arrive. Joseph went out of his way to assist us. Thank you. Ali, the breakfast chef is so obliging and his food is so good. He remembered us from a year ago. The hotel has close proximity to Saint Paul’s, just walk across the bridge. Great hotel and great service. We have returned several times. Greg.",5,2024,07,11
120,Good time in London. Thanks Hilton,"I recently stayed at Hilton London Bankside and was pleasantly surprised. The rooms are spacious, a rarity in London. The breakfast selection is delightful, and the happy hour ambiance is perfect. Yen and Domenic, the attendants, were exceptional. Housekeeping was impeccable. The only minor drawback is the lack of a nearby underground station, but it didn’t dampen our experience.",5,2024,07,09
120,Amazing,"The Hilton Bankside was probably the best hotel we have ever stayed at, the room was so clean, the hotel was spotless and the staff wonderful.
Loved the food, the drinks😁 , 
We had the breakfast included and were so pleased we did - there was so much to choose from,from start to finish it was wonderful",5,2024,07,09
120,A wonderful place to stay with great staff!,"First time in London and this was a great place to stay. Close to almost everything but in a nice, quiet neighborhood. All the staff were  friendly and helpful. On the second day of my stay, a pickpocket stole my wallet while I was touring the Westminster Abbey area. Although the incident was very disturbing, the staff couldn’t have been nicer or more accommodating. I want to especially recognize Kamaal of the concierge staff as he helped me file a report with the local police and was otherwise always extremely friendly, making our stay even more pleasant. This is a hotel that recognizes the importance of customer service, and I want them to know they are appreciated.",5,2024,07,08
120,Excellent Hotel,"We've stayed here many times and always had an excellent stay. The breakfast is the best of all the Hiltons we've stayed in and the service and staff are always very helpful and well trained. I was asked to provide a review by a member of staff in the breakfast restaurant, Seynabou Diakhate, who was very helpful and friendly. One minor problem today was we were later to the breakfast and had run out of a couple of items, which shouldn't happen if breakfast runs till 11.00 and it was only 10.00. But other than that very minor issue, we had a fabulous stay.",5,2024,07,07
120,Great Customer Service!,"I love this hotel. I stay here every time I am  in London. This time my friend had her wallet was stolen while we were on a tour. When we mentioned it to the Concierge, he took care of business and guided my friend through the process of reporting the theft. He was the same man who walked all the way to another street to find us a cab. Above and beyond. Thank you Kamaal !",5,2024,07,06
120,Nice breakfast,Visited the executive lounge for breakfast. Riyaz was very helpful and courteous. We appreciate everyone that works in the lounge. It was a wonderful experience. The food selection was great and we left satisfied. We hope to return back while on our trip.,5,2024,07,06
120,Highly dependable experience,"Haven’t stayed for a couple of months but standards remain high. Friendly customer service is second to none with special mention to Ali in the breakfast kitchen and Yen and Terrence in the exec lounge. Great hotel, great facilities, great staff.",5,2024,07,04
120,Congratulations for the staff,"I would like to thank the entire hotel team for helping me to make a special surprise for some guests staying at the hotel. 
They are very thoughtful and really helpful.
I will definitely repeat the experience at this hotel in London. Congratulations for the staff.
Especially to:
Keya Dhara

120,Excellent location and quality,"We were so happy with our 5-night stay for my son and me. We were greeted enthusiastically by the doormen and front desk team, which was welcome after our extended flight delays. We picked a room with two ""twin"" beds. I was nervous it would feel small but was actually very comfortable and easy for us to spread out. The decor is modern and in excellent condition. The location can't be beat, just a stones throw from many sites bankside and quick to hop on the tube to get to more. We had the breakfast buffet a few of the days and found the quality and variety delightful. Worth noting too the staff was educated and ready to share gluten-free selections. All in all, I highly recommend Hilton London Bankside and plan to stay here again on our next trip.",5,2024,07,02
120,Excellent hotel & location!,"Excellent hotel & location! Very nice hotel, great breakfast, nice bar/restaurant attached also. This location is close to so much! Tate Modern & Shakespeare's glode are right there along the Thames. A quant pub just down the street, and a Gordon Ramsey restaurant a quick walk away. Burough Market is a 10-15 min. walk and so worth a visit! It is also close to the Millenium walking bridge over the Thames.
Only 2 downsides - we were in an interior room on floor 1 and our window faced a small space outside and a brick wall. We did get natural light, but couldn't really see the sky. The second issue - there was very little common area to just relax in outside our room. There is some basic lobby seating, but it was usually full of people w/luggage waiting to either get checked in or leave. Otherwise a nice place to stay in a good area of London!",5,2024,07,02
120,Great experience at London bank side,"Beautiful clean friendly hotel.   Friendly front desk personal eager to assist us.  The doorman Joseph helped us with directions, taxis and handling our luggage. He also has a great sense of humor 
The Concierge lounge is great !!!   Nice people working in there.   Great variety of food and drinks. 
I will definitely recommend this Hilton hotel. Great staying on the South Bank.  It’s a bit less congested.  Lots of walkable places to visit. Enjoy your stay !!",5,2024,06,30
120,Amazing service!,"I frequently stay at the Hilton Bankside and recently the service was excellent, extremely welcoming and generous - especially Rodrigo Villa went above and beyond, a big thank you for making our stay very memorable!! Looking forward to my next stay",5,2024,06,29
120,Just Like Coming Back Home!,"Having spent a week at Hilton Bankside a year ago, and reported on our wonderful experience, we returned this year for another week, this time in the midst of celebrating our wedding anniversary. It was just like returning home after a visit abroad! We were warmly welcomed by Zuzana, the Front of House Manager, and Unni, the Guest Relations Manager who ensured all details of our stay were attended to. In the Lounge, Terrence greeted us like old friends, remembering all our peculiar requirements, including my being gluten free. The cherry was the bottle of celebratory bubbly in our room, and the special bottle of wine in the Lounge with a card from Terrence and the staff there. We couldn't have asked for more, and will always stay here on our London visits. Quite apart from the warm and professional staff and comfort of the hotel, the location is perfect for exploring the area or setting out in any direction. We highly recommend!",5,2024,06,29
120,Very welcoming,"The Hilton Bankside was a very welcoming place to stay. From the moment we walked in the doors everyone was so friendly and inviting. Our favorite part was the executive lounge; where we could sit, have a drink and snack, and relax from the long days of walking. Lutfur and Yen were always so welcoming, helpful, and friendly. It was like coming home at the end of a long day.",5,2024,06,28
120,"Exceptional Service, I won't ever stay anywhere else in London!","From check-in to check-out, the staff at the Hilton London Bankside provided outstanding service. It felt like everyone was genuinely happy to be there and enjoyed their workplace. The rooms are beautiful and modern, the beds super comfortable and the bathrooms immaculate. The rainfall shower had the best water pressure I've ever experienced (and I have a rainfall shower at home!). Breakfast buffet had a huge array of options and presentation of the food was stunning. I could not fault anything at all and I cannot wait to get back to London to stay here again.",5,2024,06,28
120,Great hotel in a great location,"Great hotel in a great area. Breakfast was delicious and if you get executive lounge privileges, their happy hour is one of the better ones of the Hilton chain. 

Daniel the Doorman totally saved me by finding me a cab that got me in time to the train station! He is friendly, professional, helpful. He’s an absolute gem!!!

Only con: you won’t get a good view even if you’re upgraded and a Diamond Member. Simply because most London hotels don’t have good views unless you want to pay 1,500.00 a night. 

Everything else was fantastic!",4,2024,06,27
120,5 star staff in very accessible hotel ,"4 star hotel with 5 star staff. A highlight was the executive lounge service provided by Terence, Yen, and Domenico.      All the staff accommodated our wheelchair and the facility is very accessible.  Southbank is actually a coveinent location.",5,2024,06,27
120,"Bankside 'Normal""","As a regular visitor I do not often write reviews as sometimes continuous good service becomes just 'normal'. However Bankside 'normal' should get a mention every now and then. Service by John Kortenray and his Team is great, they always great you with a 'welcome back' and they are always willing to assist but more importantly chat about your family or the football. The front desk staff are always busy but I needed to amend my booking this week and Aman Ahmed was great it was actioned with the click of a button. I cant forget the Lounge staff Yen is always there to great me with a smile and make sure I am watered and fed. All in all my 'home away from home'",5,2024,06,27
120,Hilton room service,"Excellent room service!! Everyone here is extremely friendly. The man, Miro, who brought our food up was very nice and offered to do everything for us. When we were checking in the people at the counter were very nice as well and helpful, this place is great!!",5,2024,06,24
120,Enjoyable stay,"3rd stay in the hotel, Really like the location near Borough Market and London Eye. Very good modern hotel, Very clean, Great buffet breakfast! Shout out to Mitchell and Daniel the doormen/ Concierge both great characters and really helpful- My son Callum who is a wheelchair user really found them a great help and a good laugh, In truth all staff very obliging! Look forward to staying again",5,2024,06,24
120,Top hotel,"Hotel is definitely one of the best, the staff are were excellent and many thanks to Daniel and Nour for making our stay special. It's location is excellent  with lots of great places to go to, the Tate Modern and Globe theatre is just 3 minutes away.",5,2024,06,24
120,Amazing!,"Everything about the Hilton was amazing. Breakfast was great with a large variety of food. The doorman, Daniel, was incredible. From telling us where to go to being a personal  photographer every day. The beds are great with comfortable pillows. Thank you for a great experience.",5,2024,06,24
120,10/10,"Really good hotel, nice clean rooms and off the busy street so it’s quite 😊 service is perfect, Mladen is super nice to us and makes us feel welcome! We only stayed for a night but wish we were here longer to enjoy the pool amenities. There is also a lounge for diamond members with nice food for a nice little tea break.",5,2024,06,23
120,Amazing hotel and we had an amazing time! Thank you!,"Hotel is amazing, really well positioned - perfect for a romantic night out! Room is impeccable and the bed is super comfy.
Miro delivered our pre dinner bottle of wine to the room and was delightful offering fabulous service. Very kind man and a credit to Hilton.",5,2024,06,22
120,Nice hotel and location,"Diamond member.  Got zero upgrade despite front desk attendant claiming he gave us one.  His lying was severely disappointing.  Room was nice, bathroom shower really great.  The executive lounge was great, good food choices, attendants very friendly and attentive.  Concierge services very good.",4,2024,06,22
120,Great stay for families,"We had a very nice stay in the Hilton Bankside hotel. The beds were comfortable and the kids loved the free fox stuffed animals and breakfast buffet. Daniel the doorman was very helpful in our stay. Overall, I really recommend this hotel for families.",5,2024,06,22
120,Stayed Twice... Both Times Horrible,"My second time staying here and my last.  It's unfortunate to read other reviews talking about ""fantastic service"" but this was my second time and it was worse than the first.

So, first time here, just a few months ago, everything went well... until I had lost my key card.  Not a big deal except when I tried to get a new key card for my room... I was told the room was registered to a completely different person!  I checked in alone there was no one else registered to stay in the room.  And oddly enough, the person at the check-in desk telling me all of this, was the person who had checked me in not even twenty-four hours earlier.  He kept asking if I knew who this person was and despite my repeated claims that I didn't know anyone by the new name that appeared on my registry, he kept asking.  I showed him an email with my confirmation number but he still kept insisting that the room was registered to someone else.  Finally I was allowed to go up to the room and prove the contents of the room belonged to me.  Up until the day I left... they never changed the registration back to my name!  

My most recent visit, was just as bad.  When I checked in, even though I had pre-paid for the room and could show receipts, they told me I had to put down a $900 deposit.  As mentioned, I had stayed previously and pre-paid the other time as well, but this time, they kept telling me I had to put a deposit down because they had not received the payment from the company I booked the room with.  I have no idea why that is my problem since I was given a confirmation number.  The ""manager"" said because it was a Friday, they would not be able to communicate with this other ""third party"" whom they have an established agreement with and therefore required a deposit from me.  Again, I showed him the emails showing the payment, the confirmation number, which they DID have because when I checked in, they had me in their system.  I even showed the payment that had been processed through my credit card.  I had purchased the room through American Airlines, not some obscure ""third party"" as he kept referring to it and how he couldn't communicate with them on a Friday afternoon is a mystery to me.  After much discussion, they finally agreed to give me a room key and allow me to go to my room.  

But that wasn't without the ""manager"" contacting me about every 15 minutes again, telling me he needed a deposit but he was trying to contact Hilton corporate to find out what to do.  I had no idea if at any minute we were going to lose our rooms.  This went on for a few days and countless phone calls before this ""manager"" informed me he was able to finally verify my payment and at this point, told me ""everything is okay"".  Well, it WAS NOT okay because we had to deal with this constant threat from the manager and WITHOUT my authorization, he in fact did charge my card for $900 and this was even after I could show him the room had been paid in full.  

So, this is just my experience with the check in and management.  Regarding the rooms, the most important thing is the bed and I agree with a previous reviewer, they are not very comfortable and for the price of this room and being a ""Hilton"" you would think they would have plush beds.  

I know people don't come to a hotel to sit in their room and watch TV.  That being said, when it's late at night and I want to wind down... or early in the morning and I want to check the news, or if I happen to be in my room doing work and want to listen to the news... it would be nice if they actually had a few channels!  I've stayed at hotels throughout the world and cannot believe they can't provide anything other than channels running ""Murder She Wrote"".  And not everyone wants to watch the BBC.  This IS a hotel designed for travelers... many of us who come from other countries so maybe we might want to watch other channels.  How can this be so much to ask?  I stayed at an AirBnB in Oxford and it had access to just about any news station you wanted as well as the ability to log into your own Netflix and Amazon account.  

There are far too many other good choices to settle for this place.  After trying twice, I can say I will never use Hilton ever again.  The ""manager"" is the most awful person without any compassion for people and is in the wrong business.",2,2024,06,21
120,Great hotel and wonderful stay!,"Great hotel. Wonderful staff and beautiful rooms. Very good location and easy to walk to the river and take transportation to all over London or even walk to a theatre or any place you would like to into town. We walked all the way to Oxford street, the main street and it was a great walk. As a diamond member they have a wonderful lounge. Breakfast was awesome in the main dining room. Thank you to the lounge staff and to Terrance. Thank you for all the guys at the front Mitchell ,Robert and J.B. all of you and all the staff were wonderful and made sure that we had a wonderful 44th wedding anniversary. Gym is nice and they have a wonderful pool indoors to swim in. 
Very clean, nice bathrooms and great shower. Nice big towels.Would definitely recommend and will stay there again.",5,2024,06,21
120,Room Service,"During our recent stay at the Hilton in London, Miro provided outstanding room service on multiple nights, consistently exceeding our expectations. His attention to detail, promptness, and courteous demeanor truly enhanced our vacation experience.

His professionalism and dedication to excellent service made our stay incredibly comfortable and memorable. We highly recommend Miro for his exceptional service and hope to see him again on our next visit.",5,2024,06,19

A special mention to the front office team who were exceptional and super helpful online and in person with all our questions and queries. Especially to a lady whose name we didn’t catch properly but begins with an “A” she was lovely and made our stay so much more memorable.  
Our 3 day were were perfect and and we cannot wait to be back next week experiencing the same hospitality. 
Thank you all for your hard work and dedication to the brand. We have been to many Hilton’s in London and across the world and this by far beats them all. 
Thank you all again.",5,2024,06,18

Special thanks to Guest Relations Managers Unni and Sandeep for recognising our Diamond status and looking after us and Keyah (?) for her warm smile and assistance at check in. The Executive lounge is amazing with excellent food and drinks options, well hosted by Terence and Lutfur. Breakfast at Oxbo restaurant was tasty and delicious including full English breakfast, cold meats, omelettes, pancakes, waffles, yoghurt, fruit, muffins etc. Chef Ali is wonderful as is the lovely lady that cooked my omelettes. But overall everyone was wonderful to us and we wish we knew everyone’s names to thank them too. 
Location is perfect within easy walking distance of the river and Southwark tube station. Plenty of supermarket options close by. 
A superbly managed hotel with the most wonderful staff throughout. Thank you so much.",5,2024,06,17

120,Wonderful Stay,"We only had a one night stay but wish we’d stayed longer. It’s a fantastic city hotel - great location, well maintained, exceptional cleanliness and the members of staff are genuinely pleased to see you. Many hotels we’ve stayed in recently seem to have reduced the quality of the breakfast but this isn’t the case here, breakfast choices were plentiful. A big thank you to Seyna who made our breakfast even better with her sunny attitude! We often stay in London when we go to shows and Hilton Bankside will be our top choice from now on.",5,2024,06,16
120,Worth every penny and more!,"I really don't know what more I can say other than the staff at Hilton London Bankside are there for you. If you're not happy, they're not happy.

They went over and above to meet our needs and would definitely be back here in future visits.",5,2024,06,15
120,"Nice, modern hotel in London","The rooms are very modern and quite spacious, especially for London. With an inner courtyard view, there was no noise from the street or other rooms. Had a bed that felt like a true king (not always the case size-wise in London). Cleanliness was good. 

The Wifi was fast but would not always automatically connect. The breakfast (included for Gold members) was an extensive buffet with many good hot and cold options. Having people cut their own bread and cheese probably isn't the most sanitary method though.

Location is fairly good if you prefer the southbank. The closest tube stop was a short walk away. Would recommend.",5,2024,06,14
120,Disgraceful stay,A irreverent interaction with the hotel staff. A very low level of service. Very not recommended! The hotel staff made everything except help me. They were very offensive and clinical during my stay. I really recommend not to come to this hotel!,1,2024,06,14

120,A difficult and frustrating hotel to review…,"•Diamond Hilton Honors Member. 
•Business & Pleasure trip. 

Arrival:
Upon arrival we were greeted by a super friendly young doorman (didn’t catch his name!). He made friendly small-talk, welcomed us to the hotel & took our bag to the front desk. 

Front desk:
We had two bookings;
- 1 night (added on at short-notice)
- 3 night stay immediately after (original booking) 
- Room categories differed due to availability. 

We emailed in advance to request that our 2 bookings be linked & if preferably if we could remain in the same room once our initial 1 night booking had been completed so we could seamlessly begin our 3 night booking without the hassle of moving rooms / checking out/in again. 

We had an email reply from the hotel with a standard “we’ll do our best / we’re busy / it’ll be subject to availability” response. Not the reassurance we were looking for as one of Hilton’s loyal customers but we accepted. 

Front desk - friendly start & we explained we’d emailed previously red above request.

Request was found on file but we were told that we’d been DOWNGRADED in order to accommodate being able to remain in the same room. 

1. We weren’t advised in the email response this was happening 
2. Why would a diamond member want to be downgraded? 

Front desk didn’t initially see the issue but I think we eventually got there after asking for the front desk manager.

We managed to get back into the original room (that we were originally booked into) but due to availability there were no other room types available for the first night to accommodate complimentary upgrade as part of Diamond perk. 

We were upgraded to a suite for the second booking / 3 night stay which was lovely! But this wasn’t our expectation. 

Room 1  (1 night stay) 

Room 1 - generally clean and tidy, unfortunately by the window was dirty on the carpet and the hairdryer bag was left on the floor - suggesting a hoover was probably missed. 

We arrived into our room around 3pm, when walking the corridor to our room we noticed - (smelt) another rooms room service left out (it was breakfast). That evening it was still outside the room and then again the following morning it was STILL there stinking. This is despite turndown staff passing it multiple times in the corridor. It meant we had to flag it to front desk the following day as the food stunk and was going “off”. It eventually disappeared after we’d mentioned. 

Executive Lounge.

Lovely, spacious and with a decent selection during serving times. it was just a shame that one staff member (who seemed to always be assigned to the exec lounge) absolutely stunk of BO. not pleasant. 

Room 2 (3 night stay) 

We got notified of our new room at literally 3pm on the dot and made the switch shortly after. 

Spacious and practical one bedroom suite. 

Generally clean with the exception of;
The main bathroom had a spider / developed web over the bat! 

The hotel upgraded us due to availability opening up & this was above the standard upgrade policy being Diamond - again, not the upgrade level we asked for or expected but it was a nice gesture. 

Frustratingly over the 3 nights our key cards kept repeatedly deactivating, meaning we couldn’t also access the elevator - we had to repeatedly visit the front desk to get fresh keys and nobody could understand why.

We did have a situation where when we asked for fresh towells from housekeeping we’d noticed red stain marks all over both towells - we flagged this to the front desk but we can’t be sure if this is something we caused (possibly ketchup) or whether it’s something more sinister like blood. We’ll never know.

Checkout.

Queue was massive so a member of staff took keys from us and said somebody would check us about after we’ve left. 

We got our invoice later than day and noticed we had been overcharged. 

We were promised a call back to discuss the over charges but this never happened so we had to call in again. 

After a few chases / managers we were advised it was a “glitch” on their side and the charge will be reversed. 

This was a really difficult hotel to review. Really up and down - when it was good it was GREAT when it wasnt it really was BAD",3,2024,06,08
120,Very nice hotel. Great staff,We had a great stay at the Hilton Bankside. The staff was fabulous. The concierge provided excellent restaurant recommendations and was very helpful.

120,Lovely experience,"Lutfum Yen in the executive lounge was exceptional, attention to detail and service was top quality. Would definitely recommend to others - came here on a work trip and couldn’t have been happier.

Perfect surrounding area. Would recommend.",5,2024,06,06
120,"Yen, lounge hostess.","As always, Yen, the Executive Lounge hostess, was very engaging and pleasant and also very efficient.

Thank you Yen.",5,2024,06,05

120,"Brilliant hotel, will be back!","One of my favourite hotels this one.

Always clean throughout, always get a nice welcome on entry. Staff very attentive at all times. 

Special thanks to Younas in the Exec Lounge for her service. We will be back :)

Brilliant location with it being so close to Southwark Station and the Shard just a mere mile away. 

Take care for now, until next time.",5,2024,05,27
120,Great experience,Went to the restaurant in the hotel and had a great and friendly server. Sam Singh was amazing and very knowledgeable of the food and drinks. Great personality and easy to talk to. I wouldn’t change anything on how he deals with customer service.,5,2024,05,26
120,Exceptional Service beginning to completion,"Fantastic service from the minute we arrived to the minute we departed .  Our adult family was greeted  with Cava sparkling drinks and candy cart  for treats. Hotel staff wouldn’t let us touch our bags from checkin to departure .  Diamond members were served daily happy hour in the Executive Lounge and Younas brought that extra hospitality to boost our experience, serving cocktails and guest we great energy! Service was 5-star from checkin, housekeeping, happy hour to checkout. Nightly turndown service, slippers and robe included was an added special touch. By far, this is the best Hilton experience our family has  experienced. We ran  into a “left behind “ bag and the staff stepped up to ensure we retrieved our bag and got it to the airport for an on-time departure . Thank you  Hilton Bankside London  for going above and beyond to make our family trip EXTRA special. We’ll definitely be back!",5,2024,05,26
120,Best Service and Experience in London!,"This hotel is UNBELIEVABLY amazing! My husband and I have had a WONDERFUL stay! The rooms are beautiful and modern. The service is impeccable!! One of their amazing staff names Younas, took the time to go above and beyond! We told her that we were craving Indian food takeout and she researched the best local options and gave us her top recommendations!! She also double checked that the restaurants  would be able to deliver and which apps they use! This is next level customer service!! Also, this is just one example. Please stay here, you will love it!!!",5,2024,05,26
120,Spectacular stay!,"Hilton Bankside was a fabulous 3 night stay for us! The staff was warm and welcoming as well as very attentive. Check in was seamless and we had arrived quite early. The doormen and concierge were very helpful. Breakfast was incredible and the coffee was great! This location was central to all we wanted to do. Thank you, Hilton Bankside for making our London visit spectacular!",5,2024,05,26
120,Another great experience at HB,This trip was another great one at HB! It’s a cut above other London hotels because the service is outstanding. The staff are very welcoming and helpful especially the likes of John and Kamal at concierge and Yen in the executive lounge. This morning one of the managers at breakfast offered to seat me in the executive lounge because the breakfast was quite busy and loud and I thought this offer was a nice touch.,5,2024,05,23
120,Brilliant service from Yen,"Yen was absolutely brilliant very nice and helpful , making great conversations with customers and delivering a great overall service. Me and my friends left the Hilton lounge genuinely happier than when we went in because the atmosphere was so great with yen working there.",5,2024,05,22
120,inconsistency in charges,"They charged me incorrectly upon check in and did not assume the responsibility of their mistake. Very bad checkout process. This is not the proper way to handle the situation, in particular with a Hilton Honors customer. They told me initially that the room rate “changed” for the last night. Later on they argued that they had initially “undercharged” me. Do not recommend.",2,2024,05,22
120,Wonderful Hotel,"Wonderful stay. The staff at Hilton London Bankside is unmatched. Everyone we dealt with was incredibly friendly and helpful - service was way above and beyond. Other hotels should use this level of service as a benchmark for standards. In particular and in no particular order - The executive lounge is overseen by Sahil and Kadiatu - they made us feel welcome and as if we were the only guests. Rhys was lovely too. My husband had an injured ankle and they got an ice pack for us every time we asked for one. The lounge was a comfortable and welcoming place in part because of everyone who staffs it. Sahil recommended an Indian restaurant as we were craving Indian food and it was outstanding. Jefferson, Joseph and John ( desk and door) were also just lovely and made us feel as if we were the only guests in the hotel, which was fairly busy during our stay. The housekeeping staff were very lovely too. Hotel itself is immaculately clean - again other hotels should use this as a benchmark for standards. There was not a speck of dust anywhere. I have stayed all over the world and can truly say the London Bankside was a pleasure. The neighborhood is also quite interesting - slightly away from the fray and crowds but easy access to everything you would want to see.",5,2024,05,19
120,Comfortable Stay in London with Many Transit and Food Options,"The London Hilton Bankside is a very comfortable hotel. We stayed here for five nights and also enjoyed access to the executive lounge as a part of 
Hilton Diamond status.

The front desk staff are very welcoming. The executive lounge staff are among the best I’ve experienced in my travels. Yen and Sahil offered outstanding service! They remembered our favorite drinks and made us feel very welcome. They are great assets to this property.
 
The room is very comfortable and quiet. The room is also large, especially for London standards. The bathroom was very nice and included a nice walk-in shower. The room was nicely appointed.

The breakfast in the main dining room is very good with a wide variety of food options. We enjoyed the restaurant for breakfast in OXBO Bankside over the executive lounge. The OXBO Bankside dinner service was ok with not the best service. The Distillery bar was a much better experience.

There is an Amazon store and a Tesco Express across the street that have affordable snacks and food. There are many pubs and restaurants that are easy walking distance from the hotel You have lots of food options on A3200 and The Cut/B300.

The Southwark tube station is an easy walk and a convenient station. The Blackfriars tube and rail station is also an easy walk. The Waterloo station is also not far. You can access much of London with an easy tube ride.

The pool is a nice feature, but doing our stay was not the warmest indoor pool. There were also some tiles and surfaces that showed wear and tear. It is a nice pool and close to the hotel gym. I wish it would have some more maintenance and could be a little warmer.

The downside of our stay was the large number of children in the executive lounge from some large families that were unsupervised and disrespectful to the other guests and staff. This is not the hotel’s fault, but the large lounge makes it attractive for larger gatherings of guests. The Conrad St. James had a better lounge atmosphere. We also didn’t have the best experience with the concierge. There was a rail strike during our stay. Concierge told us our visit to Windsor would probably not be an option. We went to Waterloo and the rail staff easily and kindly showed us our options that got us to and from Windsor with no issues. We didn’t feel the concierge was very experienced.

The entire hotel was well maintained and very clean. It is a busy hotel. If located in a good area. The Bankside area is a great area to stay in London. It is not the most central location, but easy to get to many iconic London sites by tube or an easy walk. We strategically planned our itinerary to visit places on that side of London.",5,2024,05,19
120,Amazing Hotel,"The service was amazing and very considerat.
The rooms was very good and very clean.
The food is very diverse and high quality.
The workers are so kind and make sure we will have all our needs for our visit.
We really enjoyed from the hotel and the facilities.",5,2024,05,15
120,Fantastic for a short break,"Booked a long weekend in London as a treat for my wife and I and well what an absolute gem of a Hilton hotel. I booked with points as I’m accustomed to staying with Hilton across the uk but this hotel is a real credit to the brand! Ideally located in Southwark a 2 minute walk from the Tate Modern and the Thames embankment and a 5 minute walk to Southwark underground. The staff were absolutely amazing from walking through the door where we presented with a glass of Prosecco , to check in, concierge, bar and restaurant and room cleaning services.  Everyone we encountered was exceptional, friendly and professional. 
In terms of the room that was really well appointed, clean and comfortable and I can say that my pet hate is poor showers, these were exceptional with rainfall and handheld and the temperature easy to adjust. A small thing but the shower for me always makes the difference. Best UK Hilton we’ve stayed in so will be back.",5,2024,05,13
120,Great stay,"Amazing place to stay that’s close to all the site and markets.  

Rooms are clean, amazing service by the staff. Joseph (bell man) with his big smile and hospitality set the energy for our stay. We were lucky to have him send us off as well! 

We will be back shortly!",5,2024,05,13
120,Won’t recommend,"Didn’t feel safe staying in the room, at 7:00 pm, a guy was knocking at the door and didn’t announce himself , after a few seconds I asked who it was, he might not hear, opened the door directly, for god’s sake, there was still TV voice from the room, how come just opened the door without permission and announced if he is from the hotel or where ! Besides, the room is really lace of natural light!",2,2024,05,12
120,Brilliant Hilton,"An excellent Hilton in the centre of London. From the quality of the service to the facilities and decor this is one of the better Hilton we have stayed in over the years. The rooms are well equipped, ( we were also upgraded to a suite as being a diamond member which was a nice touch), have excellent bathrooms and overall high quality furnishings. Breakfast was excellent as was the executive lounge which is a great place to spend time. Only minor point was the choice of food in the exec lounge which last night was vegetarian only, which was a shame! Why make all dishes veggie only! Staff very friendly and helpful. We thoroughly recommend as a place to stay in London and would definitely come back!",5,2024,05,12
120,First-class hotel,"Great hotel well located on the south bank. A glass of prosecco at check in, clean and spacious rooms and super-friendly staff including Joseph who gave me a nice send-off. Definitely on my shortlist of hotels that I will consider when I go to London next time.",5,2024,05,12
120,A Very Friendly and Authentic Welcome!,I was greeted by Mitchell. What a great guy. Lovely energy and so personable. When I left this morning I was looked after by Joseph. A lovely genuine gentleman who proactively asked if I needed help and support with getting to my destination.,5,2024,05,10
120,Highest praise,After airbnb cancelled our reservation the day before we chose the Hilton Bankside in the car driving in from Wales. It was an excellent choice. The accommodations and especially the people are both top notch. Thank you for a wonderful visit!,5,2024,05,10
120,HIGHLY RECOMMEND !,"Service was impeccable. Room was spotless. Bed was very comfortable but could use better pillows. 

MITCHELL was a gem… he greeted us so kindly every time we saw him. He was so friendly and helpful. I hope his boss sees this and he gets a higher pay 🙏🏼",5,2024,05,09
120,A cut above the average Hilton,"Have stayed here a number of times and always enjoyed excellent customer service and a complimentary glass of bubbly at reception on arrival which is a nice touch. Rooms are spacious, of a high standard and immaculately clean as expected for a five star hotel. Bathrooms are beautiful and the bathrobes are unbelievably soft. WiFi works well, no problems with streaming.

Recently stayed here while in London for my wife’s birthday and the reception staff kindly upgraded our room to a one bedroom suite which made the visit extra special - many thanks to Francisco and your manager, what a lovely gesture.

Breakfast is consistently excellent - along with a good hot and cold buffet selection there is also a walk up bar serving made to order eggs, omelettes etc. Restaurant tidiness and quality of ingredients is very good and staff are friendly and attentive.

Location is good, around 5 mins walk to Southwark tube station and another 5 mins to the west end on the Jubilee line. Also a short walk to the Globe theatre which means plenty of riverside restaurants and bars nearby. London Bridge and Borough Market are a pleasant 10-15 mins walk along the Thames and it feels lively and safe to walk to and from the hotel at night.

Significantly better than the average Hilton and deserving of the five stars. We look forward to returning.",5,2024,05,08
120,Great stay,"Yen and Terence was amazing in the lounge. Took care of my every need. Always very happy and accommodating, making the stay special.

I can't wait to be back in a few weeks for Sunday brunch",5,2024,05,08
120,Excellent Hotel and Location,"Stayed here for two nights to celebrate my daughter’s birthday. Hotel is excellent in all aspects and each staff member was welcoming, helpful and most of all available. Our room (just the standard twin) was quiet and clean with very comfortable beds, bathrobes, slippers and daily water. We only ate breakfast in the hotel and this was excellent with a large choice.  As two women, we felt completely safe walking everywhere from the Shard to theatre land and everything in between. Would highly recommend this hotel.",5,2024,05,07

120,Brilliant hotel,I was only at the hotel a short time but every single member of staff gave me a high level of customer service. Everyone was friendly and welcoming. The beds are comfortable and the decor is lovely. The only negative was I was in room 409 which faced on to a brick wall but it didn’t matter to me as I mainly slept in the room. The breakfast was delicious too. A special mention to Joseph who makes a great first impression on arrival. If I had had more time I would have used the leisure facilities.,5,2024,05,02

Room 309.

Stayed here due to work commitents

First time staying a 5 star hotel, so not fully expecting how it would be.

On approach to the hotel and feeling slightly underdressed, I noticed two doorman who welcomed me with open arms.

On entering, concierge also welcomed me, offering a bottle of water whilst finding a front of house associate who free to attend to myself.

Check in swift and effective whilst I believe the front of house associate was getting trained, with the trainer appearing to be training in an effective way whilst not unduly delaying the check in process.

Every member of staff offered warm, friendly yet effective service from housekeeping to maintenance whenever I came across them throughout my one night stay.

Rooms are of a standard you would expect from a hotel of this grade. 

Would I return to this location?  Yes,  I would happily return here as I wish I didn’t have to leave which is a first.",5,2024,04,24
120,Hotel Nice - Staff not so,"Nice hotel.  

Staff are rude and unprofessional.  So much for being a Hilton Honours Member we were left embarrassed and humiliated.

Will never return and doubt I will ever choose a Hilton again.  

The way we were treated was appalling and ruined a 60th birthday get together.  Thank you Hilton Bankside",1,2024,04,24
120,Best executive lounge in London,The executive lounge here at Bankside is the best I've been to. Always greeted with a warm welcome and impeccable service.

120,A Near Perfect Stay,"Very comfortable stay in a clean, modern, and well located hotel. Breakfast buffet was just okay, and some rooms don’t have the best views - including the one I had which basically looked out into some pebbles. Otherwise, the hotel ticks all the boxes in terms of comfort and cleanliness",4,2024,04,21

120,Mitchell is the actual best,"My husband and I were staying at a hotel down the street with a similar name and our driver accidentally dropped us off here. Mitchell greeted us when we got in and immediately grabbed our bags. 

Once we realized the mistake, he walked us to all the way to our hotel and helped us with our bags the whole way. He was lovely, personable, and an amazing representative of the Hilton brand.

I am a loyalist of another hotel chain but the next time I come to London, I will be staying at this hotel. Mitchell is the type of person I would hire at my company and is a true gem.  I recommend this hotel based on this one experience alone.",5,2024,04,20

The whole feel of the hotel was very nice. Breakfast was tasty. We had a lovely plate with a cake and congratulations written in chocolate for our wedding anniversary brought to our room which was lovely and was the cherry on the top of our stay. 

I was surprised that there was no coffee machine in the room as most 4 and 5 star hotels have these. I asked for fresh towels on one occasion which never turned up.

But overall we had a lovely stay!",5,2024,04,16
120,A bit hit and miss,"My partner, baby and I visited as it was my birthday weekend and we were attending an event in the area. We had decided to treat ourselves to a nice hotel for the occasion. 

On arrival, we went to check in where I was asked for photo ID which I had left at home. I offered the bank card I had paid but was challenged on this as there was no way to prove I was the person who had booked. In the end, we had to get another person to support us with check in but it was far from a warm welcome and lots of challenges back and forth with no offers of solutions

On arrival to our room, I saw the 1m wide window that faced a brick wall. I had also messaged ahead of our stay to note that due to last min changes, my baby was coming and I’d need a cot in our room but there wasn’t one in there. I headed back to reception to request the cot and a room change but was told to come back in the evening to see if it was possible. 

In the end, my partner went back down and spoke to a more helpful receptionist but after being moved, we still had a small corner window so it was extremely dark. The room itself was very tight once the cot had been added in. 

Because I hate to leave a negative review, I will say that that porter/doorman was very friendly, as were the staff in oxbo, it was a great location for what we needed and very clean. It was nice to be able to swim too but note that it isn’t heated as expected - we still had a great time in the pool

Would I return? I have loved all of the Hilton hotels I’ve stayed at but after the experience with the receptionist at Bankside - unfortunately not. I felt like an inconvenience from the minute I walked through the door which tainted my birthday weekend (and besides having to have uncomfortable conversations, it was also stressful as I had my baby with me)",3,2024,04,14
120,The perfect stay for special birthday celebrations,"Our return stay at Hilton Bankside exceeded our expectations. Greeted warmly by Bhawna and Amen on reception,ditto by the lovely doormen including Daniel and Joseph. We booked a three night stay in a deluxe king with lounge access and were upgraded to a suite. Celebrating a special birthday and we felt special every moment of our stay. It doesn’t matter what room you book, staff are warm and friendly to all. it was nice to save up though and get the benefits of the executive lounge with early eve canapés and drinks reception. 
Loved our suite and housekeeping spotless. 
The fabulous pool is open to all guests and we made use of it with a daily swim. Breakfast is impressive with so many choices, though I opted for a daily omelette as they are superb. Ali at oxbo breakfast  even  made my husband a raspberry cheesecake for his birthday. Great chef and nice man, as was the lady also cooking omelettes. Fab cocktails in   the distillery bar ( to rival the ivy!) and was nice chatting to the lead there who got one of his team to make me a bespoke cocktail based on my preferences.
There are not enough superlatives to describe this hotel. 
We will return, such fabulous old fashioned service with a modern vibe.",5,2024,04,14
120,Good service,All rhe things are good. They have good swimming pool and gym. Marcel is really friendly.and store our bags the location of this hotel is very convenient and you have two train station around one is southward and one is backfires thank you for everything,5,2024,04,14
120,Exceeded expectations all around.,"The hotel exceeded my expectations! The staff were all so friendly upon check in, and continued to be so throughout our week long stay. From the back the hotel looks very underwhelming, but from the entry way and inside it is very nice and has a good vibe. Beds were very comfortable! The breakfast was top notch and the executive lounge staff was extremely helpful and attentive, especially Sam. Highly recommend and will definitely be back in the future! Thank you again Hilton for a wonderful stay.",5,2024,04,13
120,Good hotel in Bankside.,"Good hotel. Staff is friendly. Breakfast buffet is great. About a 5 minute walk from Southwark Underground station.  Three grocery stores in the neighborhood. Executive lounge can get a bit crowded in the evening. Mayur, Nagraj, and Sahil were great in the lounge. Would recommend the hotel for a short visit.",5,2024,04,12
120,Great experience as always,"We stay at the Bankside every year to catch up with friends in London. It is always lovely, relaxing and has very friendly staff. The breakfast is great and there is lots of choice, although I did miss the smoked salmon this time. We really enjoy the benefit of the excec lounge as it's a quiet, comfotable space to grab a drink after a long day out in London. Many thanks to Marcel who helped us with our bags and was very friendly as we were checking out. All the staff are brilliant.",5,2024,04,09
120,"An unforgettable experience, with outstanding service!","We were not initially planning to come to this specific Hilton branch, however due to its location, we decided to book our stay at Hilton Bankside. The location is convenient, as it is a 10 minute walk to the nearest underground station. Upon arrival, we were greeted by the doorman, who kindly opened our taxi door to help us out and lead us to the check in desk, where there were more smiling and welcoming staff that helped create a comfortable atmosphere for us. Here, the concierge, Jefferson, let us know to find him whenever we required any bookings (including taxis) and welcomed us. As there were two of us, we had booked the deluxe twin room, which was furnished with two twin-sized beds, two bedside tables with adjustable reading lights, a small table with a plush chair and foot rest, a mini-fridge (which comes with complimentary lemonade, biscuits, and packet milks) and much storage space (such as drawers and a wardrobe). The overall style of the room was quite simple, with the often trending modern look, with many different light types (including a mirror back light and standing lamps). In terms of the temperature of the room, there is a temperature controller on the wall near the beds, which allowed us to control the temperature to our desired settings, making us very warm and cozy during the night. The lady who had completed the room service in our room, Nataliia, left a small note on our table and did an excellent job at cleaning our room for us. The hotel provides complimentary free access to WiFi depending the length of your stay, the options are 1, 3, or 7 days, however if your stay is longer you can simply reconnect after the number of days you have chosen. In terms of breakfast, the staff in the restaurant are extremely professionally dressed and mannered, and they are extremely welcoming and helpful. The setting of the tables are all very professionally set, with cutlery and cups already out on all of the tables. The overall vibe of the restaurant was spacious and finely decorated, providing a cozy and social environment and atmosphere. The food provided at breakfast were all very delicious, and seem to have been made out of very fresh and good ingredients. Alongside the buffet style setting, with a separation between the hot and cold food, you can also ask for an egg or dish to be made to your liking straight from the kitchen. One of the chefs, Shanti, was very helpful when I asked for an omelette to be made, and it came out just exactly to my liking. The checkout time is 12pm, which is nice as it allows us time to wake up late and slowly get out of bed. Our train to leave London was scheduled for 6:25pm, so after checking out, the hotel kindly took our luggage to store until we came to pick it back up. When we returned, we were swiftly provided with our luggage and a taxi was booked to take us to the station. One of the staff members, Mursal, helped take our luggage and led us to our taxi to say a final goodbye. From the beginning to end, we were provided with utmost excelling service, which we are very grateful for, especially for each and every one of the members of staff that made us feel comfortable during our stay. I would highly recommend this hotel to people who are planning to come to London, as it is accessible, quiet, and simply provides a comforting environment. If I plan to go to London again someday, I will certainly be making sure to come back to this hotel.",5,2024,04,08
120,Hilton Shines!,"Superb service! This has become my home away from home. I stayed here two years ago and I am happy to say there are a lot of familiar faces, but whether new team members or veterans, they all exemplify The Spirit of Hospitality the Conrad Hilton envisioned. Special thanks to the staff in the lounge - Nagraj, Kadiatu, and Sahil were warm, inviting, and made for the perfect welcome home after enjoying the sites. I arrived in London two years from the date I last left. I can only be so lucky of a repeat, and I’d be all the luckier if this trio of hospitality experts are here to greet me.",5,2024,04,08

120,Help us best way to enjoy hotel,"Mursal helped us move over our luggages.
He also explains all the stuffs in the room.
What i liked was he told us hotel services’ details such as swimming pool/gym’s running time.
It was nice because if we didn’t aware of this place includes them, we could’ve missed good parts.
Thank you :))",5,2024,04,07
120,Probably the best Hilton in London,"We chose the Hilton Bankside because of its central location (just south of the Tate Modern and just a short walk from Bankside Thameslink station) and high tripadvisor scores.  It did not disappoint.  We were greeted with Prosecco and quickly ushered into the Executive Lounge - even though it was two hours before the official check in time.  The front of house staff are very engaging and eager to help, whatever the time of day.  We enjoyed a delicious breakfast in the restaurant (the exec lounge does not appear to serve breakfasts ....) and the pool (around 18m long; all new and very well maintained).  The room was big, well appointed and the turn down service an unexpected treat.  Its been a while since we last visited but we will not leave it so long next time.",5,2024,04,07
120,Great location to explore london,"Hotel was nice and clean. Breakfast every morning was a great way to start everyday. Marcel at concierge was a gem, courteous and kind.

Upgraded to an executive room this time which was worth it for the breakfast included and drinks available in the lounge. Will be returning later this year.",5,2024,04,07

Sahib, Mayor, and Nagraj in the Executive lounge were fabulous. They were so attentive to my daughter. They were always pleasant. Their service was impeccable. Highly recommend. 

Overall, the hotel was great. Good location, close to mass transit, updated and clean. Minimal noise. Showers were hot, bathrooms nice and the bed super comfy.

The breakfast buffet is amazing. Service has been great during our stay.

Love the fact that no one seams to use the pool so having it on your own with the family is a big plus for us. 

Close to underground and walking distance to scenery.

Without any exception, everyone very well welcomed us. 
The Hotel is new, very well maintained and decorated. We had a beautiful and spacious room. 
The hotel is situated just a few steps from the Millennium Bridge, close to Borough Market and many pubs and restaurants.
The Hilton Bankside team is fantastic. Daniel (Doorman), Marcel and Joseph were always ready to help us at any time. It was so good to see them smiling when we left and returned to the Hotel every day!
With a wide variety of delicious products the breakfast was so good, Daniel, Ali Asgan, Shanti, Alkesh, Urvesh, Ana (Breakfast reception and Sayyad (Breakfast reception) made our breakfasts a great start to the day.
We would also like to thank all those who we did not have the pleasure of getting to know better, but who whenever we met at the Hotel they greeted us with a smile and a kind word, we are sure they also are special.
Once again, we would like to thank immensely for the attention we had from Daniel (Doorman, Marcel and Joseph. They are extremely competent, they are sensational at what they do, they know how to make a guest feel welcome, They are amazing!!

With over 150 guests, they coped admirably with the buffet dinner on Thursday evening; the black tie dinner in the ballroom on Friday, which was preceded by drinks and canapés, and finally ending on Sunday morning.

The catering was excellent throughout from breakfast to dinner.  But more than that, the staff were so friendly, welcoming and caring.  

A big thank you to Joseph who kept watch over the comings and going’s of the guests and helped me on my departure.  Thanks, Joseph.  Enjoyed speaking with you and appreciated your help.

This hotel is in a great spot.  Across the road from the Tate Modern; down the road from The Belfast;  close to the Swan Pub - go check at the evening views of St Paul’s. Shops and cafes everywhere.

We have older teenage boys so having their own room with two double beds and another bathroom is an ideal set up for us when we travel now.  We went for a suite for ourselves (the parents!)  which had a great workspace area behind the bed and a huge bathroom. It connected on a corner with another room which had two doubles and a bathroom. They felt like they had their own privacy but we were still connected as there was an outer door that we could close off to connect both rooms.  The rooms are modern and very nicely designed. 
The hotel has a great pool too and is in a great location to explore. We walk everywhere from here as it is super easy.",4,2024,03,14

120,Fantastic stay,Family of 6 - with 4 teenage boys - first time in London.  We got a family room (all 4 boys slept in that connecting room setup) and a double that was right next door.

120,"Canceled my penthouse reservation, then went back on offered room/compensation, indicate construction for next 12 month.","Made a reservation one year in advance in the Penthouse (approximately 100 sqm, 1100 sqft) and they canceled it (they say they will be doing construction) and offered me a king suite (under 50 sqm or 500 sqft) ""for 300GPB per night"" (a quote from their email.) After looking at other options I agreed to that reservation and they instead told me they made a mistake in their email, they meant 600GBP per night for the sub-50 sqm room with no compensation forthcoming, 8 months after my reservation had been made!!! Two base  rooms at this hotel would be 60% larger and 50% less expensive, and I have stayed in the base room (unfortunately), and it is minuscule with no view. The only reason to stay at this hotel was for the penthouse as the location is not good, the service is not five star (I graciously forwent a review after our penthouse stay previously), and the prices are subpar for the small rooms. With no penthouse, this will be an easy pass in the future.

Additionally, I see nowhere on their website that indicates this hotel will be under construction for the next 12 months as they told me in their email to me! Quite the surprise that will be to many!",1,2024,03,11
120,High level of service,"This hotel set high level for all Hiltons I’ve ever visited across the world. If you get a chanve try Lounge which have nice wines and food thru happy hour. Staff is very friendly, helpful and trying to fullfill your needs at its best. I would like to especially thank concierge Jefferson for all restaurant recommendations and bookings made on my behalf. This hotel is really above 4 star standard, definitely recommend this property.",5,2024,03,11

120,Not quite as great as last time,"This is a lovely hotel. Great reception. The rooms are lovely. There is a decent gym. The pool is ok but lacks a sauna. We always pay extra to have access to the exec lounge. This is fab with some drinks and snacks at 6pm. However, this time, they were not offering breakfast in the lounge - there is normally a reasonable selection of toast, cheeses, etc. this time, nothing. They just said they weren’t offering it that weekend.  I thought that was pretty rubbish!  Other than that, we did have a good stay.",4,2024,03,10
120,Great Experience,"The service overall from reception to housekeeping is great. Very nice interior, just a bit dim. Breakfast is also wonderful, great variety of both cooked and continental food. Lovely atmosphere overall, and very convenient metro transport.",5,2024,03,10
120,Pleasant and,"Clean and considerate housekeeping. Everything one might  need for a comfortable stay. The reception team very proactive, customer friendly. The concierge service very helpful. Welcome drinks and the sweet stand was impressive addition.",4,2024,03,10
120,Best hotel in London!,"We booked an Executive Room which meant we had access to the Executive Lounge. In the evening, this means that there are two hours of free drinks and food between 6.00 and 8.00. And the staff are all adorable, big shout-out to Sahil, Terence and Rhys for their help and understated service, always looking to see that we, the customers, are OK and have everything we need. Thank you to all the staff throughout the hotel, in fact: this is our hotel of choice every time we’re in London and we love it ❤️",5,2024,03,09
120,Perfect stay as always,"The service was brilliant as always, we have stayed at the hotel over 5 times and will definitely return. The hotel was immaculate and early check in was available on check in. Mursal went above and beyond to cater to our needs, he was a massive help.",5,2024,03,08
120,Beautiful Hotel ,"Hilton hotel Bankside London is beautiful location just 3 minutes walk from Southhak station and also very nearby by all beautiful attractions in central London...
Warm welcome to hotel and quick check in and comfortable stay and room amenities and room service are at the best .best hospitality as been experienced. Keep it up",5,2024,03,07
120,Weekend stay for a family event.,"Lovely weekend stay in the Hilton Bankside.  The hotel is a mix between upper end business hotel and boutique weekend stay.  The service from Joseph who was exceptional - we thought we'd arranged valet parking but because a film was being shot in the road outside the hotel, the valet would have meant our car being locked in for the weekend (which didn't work for us). Joseph found us a space across the road that we free and we used it for our entire stay.  Brilliant.  Breakfast is lovely.  The only downside is the restaurant was pretty empty on the Friday evening and the food was Ok but not great.  All up a lovely stay and worked well with the family event we were celebrating in Herne Hill.  Well worth a stay if you're visiting South Bank/Borough Market and The City - all short walks away.",4,2024,03,07
120,Hidden gem & best Hilton in London,"Booked this hotel for a work event and it definitely exceeded my expectations. The location was great 5 minute walk from train and lots of restaurants around. The decor was modern and warm, staff super friendly and attentive. The maid even rolled my bed duvet with slippers & water beside the bed whilst I was out at dinner, attention to detail goes along way I will definitely be back here!! P.s the bed was Devine it scooped me in and I didn’t want to get out!",5,2024,03,06
120,Fabulous Hotel in London and with a pool!,"What a fantastic hotel, amazing welcome by Joseph, taking our luggage and settling us with a drink. Awful check-in (sorry but it's been the worst by a  Hilton), but from there the exe. lunge, the breakfast the exe bedroom and the amazing swimming pool. Top tips and super helpful advice/general welcome by Sam Singh - who went the extra mile! Will visit again and appreciate the trend towards health snacks & drinks in the room! Cons - could do with follow-up call to make sure stay going well and if anything we need. Train new staff on HH members, what they need to know and welcome them as per Gold members so they understand.",4,2024,03,05
120,Kamaal was a star,I love this hotel. Bar and reception staff are super friendly.  Everyone is always helpful and attentive.  Kamaal the cconcierge looked after us during our stay. It's so refreshing to watch a young man take his job in his stride and enjoy it. He seemed very natural and put us at ease.,5,2024,03,03
120,Reliably enjoyable,"Always a very relaxing and enjoyable stay.
The small details make the difference, whether it's being welcomed with a smile on arrival, the fresh smell in reception and calm in reception after the buzz of the streets outside, being offered water while waiting in the lobby by the ever-friendly Marcel, or knowing my room will always be neat and clean.",5,2024,03,03
120,Awesome hotel with great staff,"We really enjoyed our stay here very much. However, we found the breakfast very disappointing.
The room (connecting rooms for the kids) was excellent in every way.
In terms of location, you are just north of millenium bridge here, so you can walk right into the heart of London in a good 15 minutes. So you are very quietly close to the centre.
The staff are super friendly.
Next time, same hotel!",4,2024,03,03
120,Great Return Visit !,"The hotel room is clean and comfortable. Great shower and facilities.
Perfect welcome from Marcel who kindly gave me a glass of Prosecco. He was kind and very welcoming to us. The exec lounge was as good as ever with food of a good quality. We were sad to hear the pool was closed but other than that a fabulous stay. Would highly recommend.",5,2024,03,01
120,An Incredible Welcome,"One of the outstanding features of this hotel is it’s incredible consistency which should not be underestimated.

Apart from the excellent quality of the hotel itself, excellent facilities and food it is the staff that truly make this a gem of a hotel which has become my second home.

From arrival at the door to checking-in the warm welcome from David and the rest of the team is genuinely one of the standout qualities of the hotel and makes me want to keep coming back.

In the lounge it is exactly the same a fantastic welcome from Yen and such outstanding service, a true credit to the hotel. It’s incredible how she interacts with all guests, she builds relationships with guests especially regulars ensuring they feel welcomed each and every time

In my opinion the best hotel in London and certainly the best Hilton property",5,2024,02,28
120,A Warm Welcome,"We always get a warm welcome when we stay at Hilton Bankside. From the “welcome back” greetings from the front desk upon arrival to the attentive staff in the executive lounge. Yen, a staff member in the executive lounge, is always so friendly, welcoming, and attentive. Coming to Hilton Bankside feels like coming home to us. Thanks!",5,2024,02,28

The hotel is very conveniently placed for the Tate and across the river to St Paul’s. 

The rooms are very spacious and well appointed",5,2024,02,27
120,Great experience in this hotel,"As usual, the stay at the hotel was great. Love their breakfast (excellent and varied choices). Special shout-out to Yen (again), who works in the business lounge. She knows us by now and she is always friendly and welcoming. She knows what we like drinking, always speaks to us a little bit even when the place is busy and crowded. Overall, everyone is friendly and professional in this modern hotel. We like being there on a regular way.",5,2024,02,27
120,Best hotel in London,"I cannot say enough kind things about this hotel. Customer service was incredible from the moment I arrived until I left for the airport. The breakfast spread is incredible and the rooms are excellent. Beds are comfortable, rooms are clean and spacious",5,2024,02,27
120,The hotel staff is incredible!,"The hotel staff is incredible! I had my doubts before booking, due to the size (7 floors), but the rooms have nothing to envy to 30+ floors hotels. However, what makes this place special is the staff. They are not only friendly, attentive and cordial, but also their dedication to detail is to a next level. Starting from the front desk where Mr Park wishing you good morning every day by your last name, al well as the house keeping moving a bottle of water and sandals next to your bed for your convenience, or porter Marcel honestly telling me when I didn't have cash to don't worry about, that my recognition for his great work is the best tip for him. I do really appreciate those details and for sure I will stay here again and again during my next visits to London. Thank you Hilton Bankside!",5,2024,02,26
120,Everything of the best!,"Brilliant welcomefrom the exceptional staff especially Daniel the doorman! 
Great pillows, amazing down duvet, excellent linen in the beautifully appointed room.
Very attentive team.

Rooms are lovely and the location gives you a nice walk over to the west end.
Will be back again soon 😁
",5,2024,02,25
120,Marcel (guest services)- above and beyond!!,"Marcel was the cherry on top of an amazing stay! His valet service was so personal, even just to escort me needing something out of my parked vehicle during my stay!

Wonderful conversation and wonderful energy! He genuinely embodies incredible hospitality!",5,2024,02,24
120,Brilliant!,"Excellent service throughout. Naomi at reception was extremely kind and helpful. Later on, in the bar Ashok was brilliant and made us feel very welcome and happy. Would come again! Firm bed, good fridge, would come again. All the other staff were also excellent and lovely to myself and my family.",5,2024,02,24
120,Marcel made it for us!,"Wonderful reception and bar area but what really made it was Marcel on the door. So friendly and smiley; he was warm and welcoming and made it feel like we were coming 'home' everytime we stepped through the door. 

Nice pool too. Gym seemed good.",5,2024,02,23
120,Great executive lounge,"I stay regularly at the Hilton Bankside and it has exceptional service. When I go the executive lounge, the staff are very friendly and helpful. Yen always says hello with a smile and is always willing to help. All of the staff are amazing and part of the reason I come back - including Terence and Kadiatu",5,2024,02,22
120,Excellent celebration stay,"The Hilton Brand ought to be really proud of the staff at this hotel who genuinely work hard to ensure you have a good stay; especially the reception team who helped us sort out a celebration package for our daughter’s 16th birthday. 

First impressions were great with a warm welcome and a presentation of a glass of wine! Never had that at a Hilton before. Ok so the views from the room won’t blow you away due to the building type and location however if you are looking for a high end room of a decent size in a convenient part of London then this is absolutely the place for you. Not to mention the facilities including a decent sized pool and jacuzzi which believe it or not isn’t actually common for London hotels so makes the Bankside stand out even more. 

The breakfast was described by my daughter as the ‘best hotel breakfast ever’. She is very fussy with food and hard to please when it comes to food and so that goes a long way. 

All in all our stay was fantastic, memorable and the Hilton Bankside did not disappoint at all.",5,2024,02,22
120,A++,"Always a great hotel to visit and Yen in the lounge is always so pleasant, polite and helpful. Breakfast is amazing and one of the best in all Hilton’s that I stay in. Rooms are always well presented. Digital key cards regularly fail which can be frustrating.",5,2024,02,21
120,Another great time at Hilton Bankside,"I always love staying here when I'm in London, the staff are very efficient and friendly. I'd like to call out specifically Yen and the team in the lounge who always make you feel welcome :) I think its the best lounge i've been to and I have recommended to all my colleagues who travel here on business.",5,2024,02,21
120,Yen - What a STAR!,"Nothing more complicated than the amazing service delivered by Yen… 
Every time she is working when I stay here the service is outstanding.  After a long day, what you can absolutely guarantee is that Yen understands the pressure you’ve been under and goes out of her way to be personable without being overbearing. Thank you Yen you truly are amazing",5,2024,02,21
120,Best Hilton executive lounge in London,"Exec lounge staff are the best! Yen is always such a happy smiling face when I go to the lounge and is always happy to help in any way she can. 
This is definitely the best executive lounge in London and I’ve been in most of them. 
There’s always a warm welcome.",5,2024,02,21
120,Great time!,Marcel was a great host and really made us feel welcome! He was very cheery and hospitable so we will be coming back because of his great service. The team on front desk are always so pleasant and make us feel welcome from the minute we walk in. Thank you!,5,2024,02,19
120,Great service and location,"We stay here every time we are in London.  The front desk staff are welcoming and hospitable. Rooms are modern , clean, comfortable and very quiet! It’s just behind the Tate Modern on a quiet street with a Sainsbury, Tesco and Amazon Fresh all within a block.   The Tube station and Southbank walkway are minutes away. Hilton Bankside has  a wonderful breakfast that fills us up until dinner for a day of tourism.  Our executive lounge server, Terence Kadiatu, topped up our champagne flutes with grace and a warm smile while we enjoyed hearty evening snacks.   This hotel is our go-to place which has never disappointed, highly recommended!",5,2024,02,18
120,Hilton Bankside - tops!,"Extremely friendly staff, great location.  From the moment I checked in - great guy at the front desk, to taking a short swim in the indoor pool, a well appointed gym,  to a very comfortable room. 
 
Great food in the lounge and a shout out to the staff in the lounge - Kadiatn and Terence.  They were amazing!",5,2024,02,18
120,Just wonderful start to finish,Went to the afternoon Sunday brunch at Oxbo food and staff were fabulous. Stayed the night in the hotel staff very attentive. Hotel is just stunning room and interior of the hotel. Special thankyou to Aman at reception very friendly would highly recommend,5,2024,02,12
120,"Great hotel, but service could have been better.","The hotel itself is great, lobby looks very classy. The room was superior and the location is amazing. 

However, I expected my breakfast to be delivered to the room (I put a breakfast card outside by the time stated on it). The following morning I discovered that no one collected the card, and breakfast was not delivered. I went downstairs to have breakfast instead. It was already 10:45 which was just 15 min before the breakfast closing time and was told by the manager to have a ""quick breakfast"" because the restaurant was about to close soon. It was very confusing and not customer oriented cause if the breakfast would have been delivered in the first place, I wouldn't be there 15 min before the restaurant closes! After I shared my experience with reception, no one really apologized and didn't really care which was disappointing. 

I would stay again but would think twice before using facilities.",3,2024,02,11
120,Hilton Bankside,Excellent stay. Very comfortable and clean rooms. Staff were amazingly attentive and helpful. Massive choice of items for breakfast with a special shout out to Sayyad Would really recommend it. Amazing location too close to the Tate and Millennium Bridge,5,2024,02,11
120,Great front desk staff,"Friendly, helpful, and capable front desk supporting an early checkin after a long night of travel. The Hilton Honors Lounge while waiting for room to be cleaned was perfect place to unwind out of the rain with some complimentary prosecco.",5,2024,02,09
120,Executive lounge,Yen and Terrence were great in the lounge . Polite and attentive. Giving advice and asking opinions . Extemeky pleasant.the main reason I will return to see a smile and someone to ask about my day .      I saw children being asked questions which made them happy,5,2024,02,08
120,Lovely lounge experience,"Lovely lounge experience. Yen was extremely attentive and ensured all was good with our stay. The lounge was clean, and very pleasant to sit in.  The 6-8,happy hour was  fantastic, and drinks were always replenished. Overall was a very good stay",4,2024,02,08
120,Upgrade to executive to chill with Yen & Terrence!,"Gorgeous hotel, walking distance to Bank and City via Borough Market.
There is a pool which is awesome.   The breakfast is superb, omelette made to order & pancakes.
The Executive Lounge is so chilled & lovely, I am always looked after by the excellent Yen & Terrence.  The you so much.",5,2024,02,07
120,Still Amazing,"I've visited this property back in 2016 and wrote a wonderful review and I decided to take a chance and try them again 7 years later. To my surprise, I was even more impressed than I was the last time. We selected the breakfast option, and the food was amazing and the service was even better. Every corner of this property was well kept. The area is prime and close to the tube station and attractions. I have a feeling we'll be back this year. Why change a good thing. Keep up the great work!",5,2024,02,06
120,Excellent,"One of the best Hiltons in London and maybe even one of the best I’ve experienced thus far. Friendly staff, really spacious and clean rooms and good facilities.

120,Perfect,"Excellent stay at Hilton Bankside, lovely staff in every department, great rooms and well located, we shall certainly be returning in the very near future. We have stayed at many Hilton hotels but this is certainly one of the best for location and polite service",5,2024,01,29
120,The staff are superstars,"My third visit to Hilton Bankside.
Each visit is better than the last if that is even possible.
Whoever trains the staff deserves a medal. From the doorman to the reception staff to the restaurant staff and bar. Everyone is upbeat chatty and charming.
Very nice touch being given a glass of Prosecco on arrival.

My wife and I felt very special.We had a wonderful time so thank you Hilton Bankside.",5,2024,01,29
120,Amazing Concierge,"The Hilton Bankside is a wonderful place to stay and attractions are close by. 
The hotel has a fantastic pool and gym facilities. 
The executive lounge was a relaxing space to catch up with friends. 
Exceptional mention to Jefferson who couldn’t have been more helpful and made our stay extra special.",5,2024,01,28
120,Great people make great hotels,"The Hilton Bankside is wonderfully located in Central London, walking distance to the ancient castle, crown jewels, etc.
The staff is great. My server for breakfast was Catalina from Moldova. She is very personable, attentive and engaging. 
The friendliness of the staff reflects well on management and the Hilton brand. If I get to Lindon again, the Hilton Bankside will be my first choice.",5,2024,01,28
120,Another great stay! Well done Hilton Bankside,"I’ve stayed here before and had an equally brilliant experience. No change to the aesthetics so I didn’t upload pictures this time but we stayed in a deluxe room which was super clean, spacious and had a super fluffy large robe.  

As honours members we utilised the digital checkin and had the key on our mobile which was really easy to do. We also used the chat service on the app to confirm valet parking which is a great service that was reasonably priced and well managed. 

We also had a lovely meal in the main restaurant where service was excellent. We chose this hotel because it’s the best in proximity of the event we were attending and I will be back again!",5,2024,01,27
120,Short break after Christmas,"I’ve reviewed this splendid hotel on previous occasions and am very happy to say it’s is a lovely place to stay. The Staff, the breakfast, the pool & accommodation everything is top notch. 

We had the opportunity to avail of the Exec Lounge during our stay and it never disappoints. The staff are friendly and accommodating in particular I’d like to mention Nayur, Sahil, Rachit & Bibin who look after us so very well. 👏

Whenever I return to London will always stay in the Hilton Bankside. The location is just perfect. 

I’m looking forward to my next stay at the Hilton Bankside. 👍",5,2024,01,24
120,From Chicago to London with love,"BEQA  and  Juan were our bartenders.    When I tell you they looked out for us....WOW!    We flew in from Chicago, and from day 1, they treated us like family.   This hotel bar was fantastic.  My wife  and I were in tears from the jokes.   (Honesty)  It may have been the mixed drinks and the 4 shots that played a part, too (lmao).",5,2024,01,24
120,Faultless trip,"I wouldn’t even know where to begin with this hotel. Exceptional reception staff who go above and beyond to help and make your stay as enjoyable as possible even down to small details. Visited for my mother’s birthday and everything was perfect. Location is ideal for getting around London and the rooms are spacious, modern and very clean. The pool is well worth a visit and is a lovely break from exploring the city. Couldn’t ask for any more and will absolutely return when back in London.",5,2024,01,22
120,Family London Trip,Sam and team at the lobby bar made our stay amazing. Friendly service and he was like our home base tour guide pointing out places to go and the best ways to navigate the Christmas to New Years time in London,5,2024,01,22
120,"Flawless food at The Distillery, Hilton London Bankside",We adore this hotel and come back at least twice a year for the weekend. The rooms are stunning. We always eat at The Distillery bar and the staff are so wonderful! Always greeted warmly and attentively. The food is fantastic and we know we’re always guaranteed a great evening. Particular thanks to Sam Singh who always makes us feel at home.,5,2024,01,20
120,Good experience and thank you to the executive lounge,"Modern, fresh and clean hotel, well located with a short walk to a few tube stations / bus stops.  Thank you to Sam and (Deniza, name from memory) in the executive lounge, friendly and excellent service.  I will stay again.",5,2024,01,19
120,Extra Step on Customer Experience,"One of the most pleasant business stays ever. Made extra fabulous by the warm welcome from Daniel the Doorman. Such a professional, such great pride in his job and was so very very helpful ordering taxis, minding my case. Just the extra class you need and you take away and remember how positive the experience was!",5,2024,01,19
120,"Amazing location, great gym, beautiful modern hotel that worked well for our family","Starting with the positives — the hotel is very new-looking, modern, and clean. We stayed in two adjoining family rooms which was convenient. We used the gym (excellent with a good variety of machines and also nice and clean) and kids used the awesome pool almost daily. The hotel staff were all very pleasant and helpful. The location is unbeatable for its convenience to not only south bank but central London attractions. It was walkable to tons of stuff on our itinerary and the stuff that wasn’t (eg West London, Kensington) was an easy tube ride away. The location also offers great access to restaurants and coffee shops. Finally, WiFi worked well in the hotel (no issues), beds were comfortable, and it was nice there was decent dining on site which we used once when we got back from an activity super late and were too tired to go out. 

As far as negatives — the rooms while lovely were a bit smaller than anticipated. I misread the description on the family room and expected accommodations for 5 but the kids room was really just 2 twins. We were able to squeeze our 3 kids no problem but for the price, I would have expected maybe a pullout sofa option or a better way to accommodate family size 5. Also the bathrooms worked fine for us because our kids are teens but keep in mind the kids’ room (at least ours) did not have a tub, modern shower only. Also the breakfast buffet which was included was decent (delicious eggs) and it worked but did not wow me compared to comparable and even lesser priced hotels.",5,2024,01,18
120,Lounge review,"Lovely hotel with lovely staff. Excellent lounge with great service from Yen and Terrenle! Always enjoy my stay here, always treated with the upmost respect and friendliness. Each stay is made up of great staff and great resources and locational benefits. As a diamond member, it is one of my favourite London hotels to stay in.",5,2024,01,17
120,Fabulous,"What a fabulous Hotel - the staff are simply amazing. The rooms are lovely, conference facilities superb. Jumana looked after us so well in the ballroom and Daniel the Doirman was a superstar. Thankyou!",5,2024,01,17
120,Perfect from start to finish,"Just back from a wonderful 3 night stay in the Hilton London Bankside hotel. Everything about our trip was perfect from start to finish. The hotel is in a lovely area, a great location with many tourist attractions nearby and plenty of lovely cafés and restaurants nearby. The hotel staff were very welcoming and always had a smile and offer to assist with our plans. The concierge staff provided great advice and took the time to check out the full details  on our queries online prior to confirming with us. The room was great, clean and well serviced. The Hotel has a beautiful swimming pool and gym, we were able to use the facilities which helped us relax into our action packed weekend. We will highly recommend the hotel and will be back. Thank you for a great experience.",5,2024,01,16
120,The best hotel to de-stress also because of the friendly staff,"We spent two nights in this amazing hotel.
Everything met our wishes. The staff is extremely friendly. Every morning when we had our breakfast we felt completely relaxed, you are completely de-stressed here.
The location is fine. We are two people who like to do a lot on foot, so the distances to the highlights of London were no problem for us.
We will 100% come back and recommend this hotel to everyone!",5,2024,01,16
120,Beautiful Bankside,"Our 7-night stay at the Hilton Bankside was one of most memorable in many years of staying at Hiltons around the world.  The hotel's location on Bankside, south of the river Thames, makes it a great base for business and pleasure, with the convenient Southwark Tube station just 5 mins away.  

We were warmly greeted by Annabell at reception, who upgraded us to a suite that was immaculate and quiet.  Diamond members will also love the executive lounge, hosted perfectly by Sahil and Kadiatu.  The comfortable, cosy and serene executive lounge design and atmosphere makes it quite unique and much less sterile compared to some lounges in larger Hiltons.  

Breakfast was served in the main restaurant, with a great buffet selection plus cooked to order eggs and omelettes.  The chef, Ali, was incredibly efficient and by day 3 had my poached eggs ready for me before I had even asked for them!  But, that was the impression I got from everyone at the Bankside Hilton, the staff were all so helpful and efficient.  

The Bankside area is a wonderful combination of traditional and modern, with many great restaurants and pubs near the hotel.  Mar I Terra is a great tapas restaurant, just 3 minutes walk away. We also noted that the whole Bankside area was exceptionally clean and well maintained and we always felt safe walking in the neighborhood.",5,2024,01,15
120,Unmatched hospitality,Trip was amazing! Daniel and Kamaal showed great hospitality and the travel advice was unmatched. Stayed at Hilton Bankside in London. Will definitely return in the near future. Coming from Florida to London can be stressful trying to figure out things to do. But these guys made it very easy to make those decisions.,5,2024,01,13
120,Good times in London,"Had a great time and the service at the distillery by Shashamas was very good. Mr Ashhak , introduced me to a variety of gins that I will looking for when I get home.
A few blocks away is an Italian restaurant, Capricci, also has some good food.",5,2024,01,12
120,Hotel with gin bar,"Stayed here for business as it close to the office. were friendly & helpful. There is a distillery bar that serves 100 types of gins. Food is not bad too.  Though the guest rooms are a bit dark and dated, it was clean & beds are comfortable with fresh smelling bedsheets. There are a few grocery shops (Tesco & Sainsbury) nearby where you can get snacks & drinks.",3,2024,01,08
120,"Ok, but not what I was hoping/expected","After an intensive and hard year I wanted to treat myself to a few days in London and see my English girlfriend.
I messaged (through the Hilton app) the hotel I was a bit earlier just to get an idea if I was going to be able to go to the room. They responded it was subject to availability, which i already knew but they could've had a look or given a more customer friendly answer. 
When I arrived at the hotel, the entrance was nice by the staff (guys in the long coats), glass of prosecco (perfect). Receptionist was friendly and unfortunately my room wasn't ready, but she said they were going send me a text once it was. I went to the bar (distillery) which has a perfect atmosphere and great drinks. The club sandwich i ordered had very dry chicken, but that's unfortunate. A few hours later it was 3 pm and I went back to the reception and asked if a room was available with the same receptionist. She looked annoyed only asked me if I had a second, programmed the card put it in the jacket (wrote the room number on it) and just handed it to me looking annoyed and not saying a word. 
I was happy I didn't have to wait any longer but hadn't received any notification if the room was available earlier.. 
The room was very nice, very clean and cleaned perfectly, only simple issue I had was the lighting is a bit unfortunately set with the switches. I couldn't kill the bright lights in the hall by itself but only by killing them all when you go to bed. 
On the 31st me and my girlfriend decided to make a reservation for the Nye dinner at the hotel. We came in in the afternoon but the same receptionist wasn't able to make a reservation booking for us and forwarded us to the bar (since the restaurant was closed), the young guy at the bar wrote it down on a piece of paper. In the evening. When we came in the reservation wasn't know at the restaurant but there were enough seats available for a guest from the hotel. 
Although our dinner experience wasn't good the response from the hotel in the next days to that situation was good. 

After we tried to watch the fireworks we came back to the bar and the atmosphere (and dj) were perfect. The server from Nepal was very friendly and we had a great time. 
Unfortunately when I tried the breakfast room service some things were missing, which also can happen and wouldn't mention if it was one thing,  but it's unfortunate I kept experiencing them.

Special thanks to reception staff: mr Seton, mr Park and the bar staff and Mr Zein Sammoun for their service, assistance and help. 

Since this is a 5 star hotel and maybe I expected too much, but a number of these things start to make you think. So although everyone tried hard, I will not be returning in the future ",3,2024,01,06
120,Warmth in Bankside,"We arrived several hours early, but staff stored our luggage and promised to text us when our room was ready. At every turn we were encouraged to advise them if we needed anything. It all seemed authentic and genuine and everyone delivered on their commitments. Aman was particularly helpful and engaging, but everyone in the hotel stepped up to deliver thoughtful service. Thank you all!",5,2024,01,05
120,Hilton Bankside Executive Lounge ,"While staying at Hilton Bankside in London, I frequented the Executive Lounge every evening where I experienced five star service from Kadiatu & Sahil. Their service was polite, professional, attentive and overall brilliant!! This is the number one best  Hilton Executive Lounge that I’ve ever experienced!! The comfort, ambiance, food and drink offerings, and customer service were 💯 first class!!!",5,2024,01,05
120,Executive Lounge top class.,"The hotel is a very high standard. The staff are excellent. We were lucky enough to be able to access the executive lounge where Sahil and Kadiatu provided highly professional service.

The rest of the hotel is very well appointed. There is a pool and Jacuzzi in the basement under Gym with peloton bikes. The room themselves are great, calming design still feel very new.",5,2024,01,05
120,"Great hotel , Great breakfast, Great Staff.","We stay in the Hilton Bankside every year. 
We first make our reservations thru the hotel, Federica is very helpful. 
When we arrive in the morning,  John is always there to greet us.
The following 11 days we go to the best breakfast room in the entire Hilton. System System.
My breakfast is perfectly made by Ali or Daniel every day. 
I will try and mention the many staff members that help us daily.
Joshua, Malika, Panagiota,Jumana,and Baby.
So many great people,  we cant name them all.
The entire staff from Raoul down is helpful and kind.",5,2024,01,05
120,"Relaxed, luxurious stay, close to London sights","What a wonderful hotel to stay in. We could not fault it. Extremely comfy beds, sound proof rooms with blackout curtains. We all got the best sleep. The breakfast buffet with chefs cooking hot items such as pancakes and omelette was fabulous. Great choice for everyone.",5,2024,01,05
120,Lives up to Hilton brand,Great hotel and service! Piolensca was very kind checking us in and answered the many questions we had. Excellent breakfast and meets Hilton standards. Rooms were also spacious and clean. Executive lounge was decent but had very friendly staff. Shower water pressure was good. Hotel is in a good location too.,4,2024,01,05
120,Thank you Raoul and Hilton Bankside Team ,"I booked my stay at the Hilton Bankside due to an unpleasant experience at the Curio brand at The Westminster London. Prior to even arriving at the Hilton Bankside I received a warm welcoming from the general manager Raoul Desouza via email, I smiled and thought it was very sweet to send such an email. I sent an email back asking for any available upgrade as i was celebrating a special occasion. Upon checking in, I was greeted with a glass of champagne, I was then checked in with the front desk manager Annabell who was super friendly, and informed me of my upgrade to a 1 BR suite and thanked me for being a diamond member, I was very grateful that she acknowledged my loyalty with the brand and she even engaged in a warm conversation about me telling her I was celebrating ( I got the complete opposite experience at the Westminster London, they even said my room number out loud at that property). I was very happy with my experience upon entering, after getting up to my room I then checked my email and realized Raoul replied back to my email, although he was not able to upgrade me to the penthouse suite that I asked he told me he and his staff well be sure that I enjoyed myself. I went to the gym and when I came back up there was a bottle of champagne along with a cake on the table that said congrats! , I was so happy, Raoul even called the room to congratulate me and make sure I received the gift from the Bankside team. I LOVED the staff here, LOVED the manager exceptional customer service, and LOVED that I was valued as a diamond member this will be the location I always come to from now on, any time I come to London, wish I would’ve booked this for my entire stay. Thank you Hilton Bankside team and thank you Raoul.",5,2024,01,04
120,A Lovely stay,"Lovely hotel in a prime location,staff are amazing and very helpful,the staff that clean the rooms do a fantastic job and never get enough credit they make the room so nice and inviting. The Doormen are all so helpful all the time they always go above and beyond Daniel was one of them that was brilliant they take their job very seriously. This hotel is in a prime location with all you need close by . A lovely stay .",5,2024,01,04
120,Always a family friendly stay,"Yen kadiatu is very good at her job and always very helpful. I come to the Hilton Bankside with my Mom & Dad and Yen is always kind to me, whenever we go to the Exec Lounge she is very helpful and gets me with drinks and food. I hope she had a great new year. Thank you Harry",5,2024,01,04
120,New Year Celebrations,"Our stay to celebrate New Year 2024 was perfect in every way! At reception Guest Relations Manager Naomi checked us in and made sure everything was spot on for us.  We had 2 rooms booked and Naomi kindly made sure we were located next to each other.  Our rooms were outstanding, the Executive lounge offered a fantastic selection of food and drinks and breakfast was delicious too!  When staying in London we won't stay at any other hotel.  This modern hotel with the best team will be hard to beat.",5,2024,01,04
120,"Lovely stay, but..","We have spent 6 nights over Christmas at the hotel, as well as another night,  2 days later. We have been staying at the Hilton Bankside on numerous occasions over the last number of years and have always find the staff, food and general atmosphere excellent. However, over the last few visits we have noticed that on several nights the Executive Lounge is more of a 'Kid/Toddler Zone' than a place to chill and relax after a busy day out. Noisy kids running around might be cute to some parents/grand parents but not everybody finds it amusing. It is appreciated that they have paid for their rooms and access to the lounge, but equally so did we. It would be great if there was a quiet or kid free lounge for those who prefer peace and quiet. However, just to reiterate the front of house staff, housekeeping staff, restaurant and bar staff were excellent. The lounge being extremely busy over this period could have done with a few extra staff members and more frequent clearing/cleaning of the tables. ",4,2024,01,04
120,"Excellent staff, stylish facilities! ","We really enjoyed our stay in this hotel! From the start, the concierge (Jefferson) helped us get situated with tours and restaurant reservations. Our rooms were exactly as we hoped and very stylishly appointed. Our only complaint would be that the lighting was dim in the guest rooms. The staff was excellent in every interaction and in every location - front desk, concierge, restaurant, bar. We found the breakfast to be consistently good each morning, with plenty for everyone in our party to choose from. The hotel location was ideal for reaching the Thames and several underground stations. The concierges helped us several times and were supremely pleasant and knowledgeable. We loved our stay here, and it enhanced our London experience! ",5,2024,01,03
120,Great hotel!,"Great hotel - I have stayed here 2-3 times per year over the last few years and it keeps delivering on quality. We just completed another 5 nights and had a great time. The staff are great, breakfast is very good, rooms are good, hotel is very clean, pool and gym are good, location excellent. Nothing negative to say and will be back again soon.   ",5,2024,01,03
120,Really good executive lounge,"As Diamond members, we have been to a lot of executive lounges worldwide. The one at the Hilton Bankside is one of the best not in the least because of Ms Yen Rachit who takes care of everyone in the most wonderful way. ",5,2024,01,03
120,Great Hotel worthy of The Hilton Brand!,"This is a great hotel worthy of the Hilton brand! The room and service was wonderful.
Great Location with The White Hart Pub in easy walking distance. The Lobby is nicely decorated with pictures of foxes. Modern, yet cozy feel. Great place to stay.",5,2024,01,01
120,5* hotel / 5* Francisco Torres on reception,"We regularly go up to London as a family, and since discovering the Bankside, we haven't found anything to knock it off top spot!
The lovely pool has incredible opening hours: 0600-2200h. Breakfast is delicious in a bright friendly room with a large live station.
Even the ""basic"" rooms are lovely: nothing small and cramped anywhere here, and sockets everywhere.

A special commendation this time round for Francisco Torres on reception. Everything about his attitude was ""let's see what we can do"", and receiving a wide smile and greeting each time you go in and out is priceless.

PS if you can stretch to the executive lounge, it's one of the best in town.

Southwark tube on the Jubilee line is 5 mins away (for going into town: direct to Green Park/Bond St.), the Old Vic and The Globe are just as close, and Borough Market less than 10 minutes' walk away for fantastic food.

Can't wait to go back.",5,2023,12,27
120,Amazing hotel experience and great location in the city! ,"I stayed here for about 10 days and had a wonderful experience from start to finish. The hotel staff was very friendly and welcoming at every interaction. The hotel itself is beautiful, clean, and well decorated. There is a nice area for children to play in, and the lobby is so spacious with trendy decor. There are lots of insta-worthy photos areas! The hotel staff was super friendly and I enjoyed asking them for tips/ideas on places to visit in the city.

I stayed in the king deluxe room and had lots space for me to store my items and luggage. The bathroom was clean and also spacious. I had a nice desk area to get some work done. The TV had a good selection of channels. I have to say, the pillows and the bed were the most comfortable I've experienced at any hotel I've been to (I'm from the U.S.). It was also easy to control the thermostat in the room, which is way better than I've experienced in other hotels. The fitness and pool areas were nice as well. 

In terms of the food, I enjoyed having breakfast daily at Oxbo Bankside. There were so many options for alternative milks, healthy warm and cold foods, and delicious juices. The chefs also had some halal sausages upon request. There was delicious Indian foods being served as well. The teas and coffees were so good. There is a coffee machine at the restaurant if you'd like something with espresso. The lunch and dinner menus at Oxbo were also delicious. There is always a great array of desserts that not only look good, but taste delicious and fresh! We also had tea with dessert at The Distillery. It's a nice spot for hanging out later in the evening when things are winding down. 

The location of this hotel is a major perk. Just next door, there is a coffee shop and convenience store. If you walk down the street a little further, there are lots of more dining and shopping options. The area is super safe and there are lots of people walking even in the evening. From the hotel, it takes a few minutes to walk to the tube station. I often walked from the hotel to the bridges across River Thames and was able to see all of the famous London attractions. I would use Apple Maps to get directions to the tourist sites (Buckingham palace, Westminister Abby, Tower of London, etc) and was able to get there by walking with no issues. The walks were scenic and I felt that I got to enjoy London so much more this way. 

In summary, I thoroughly enjoyed staying at this hotel and I would give a 10/10 for the hotel experience and amenities, welcoming staff, delicious food, and amazing location in this beautiful city. I will definitely be back! ",5,2023,12,24
120,Perfection and paradise found in this Hilton!,"This hotel has been an awesome experience!  Top of the line in every respect!
The hotel provides spacious rooms that make a family stay a pure joy!  Children robes, stuffed 🦊 foxes, blankets and pillows with Fox characters made the children stay a dream!",5,2023,12,23
120,Highly recommend ,"One of the best hotel stays we have had in a few years.  Hotel is clean, staff is courteous and very attentive, breakfast buffet had many options, and the beds were super comfortable. We used an inter-connecting room for our family and it was perfect.  Our stay in London during Christmas was magical.",5,2023,12,20
120,fall visit ,"I spent 5 days here in the fall.  The hotel was clean, centrally located for us. The lounge breakfast was very nice.  The staff was polite. Daniel the doorman was a pleasure to greet us each day.  All in all I would stay again. ",5,2023,12,18
120,Always Great,"Our favourite London hotel - and it never disappoints. The friendliness of the entire team make a stay here really feel like home from home. As ever, the staff went the extra mile to make our stay perfect. Special mention to Yen in the executive lounge who epitomises everything that is good about Hilton Bankside.",5,2023,12,18
120,Outstanding!,"We stay in many Hiltons, including quite a few in London. This is the first time we stayed at this hotel or on the south bank. We were there for a week and greatly enjoyed it. The hotel is modern (only 8 years old). The location is great - walking distance to the London Eye and the Shard. There are plenty of restaurants, pubs and stores in the neighborhood. Our room (Diamond upgrade) was very spacious and comfortable, with a small office separated by a half wall, and a nice view. The breakfast was wonderful. The Executive Lounge is great, with a broad selection of food and alcoholic beverages. The entire staff is outstanding - they always speak to you. Worth special mention are Nasser, on the front desk, and Raoul de Souza, the General Manager. Both were very welcoming and accommodating. 
All in all, a wonderful stay.",5,2023,12,18
120,Always a great stay + thank you Exec Lounge team,"I've had many stays at Hilton Bankside as it remains my favourite of the London Hiltons. Staff are extremely friendly and helpful and the rooms have always been pristine. 

A big shout out to Yan and the Exec Lounge team who always make the effort to make my stay just that bit better... despite my ever changing drink preferences! ",5,2023,12,17
120,Great hotel with great service.,"First time staying at a Hilton & we were delighted. The staff were all approachable & helpful especially Aman Ahmed at reception & Arban in maintenance who got my air conditioning to work when I couldn't figure it out. Comfortable & spacious room with fabulous bathroom, in a great location. We'll be back!",5,2023,12,16
120,Hilton Bankside is the perfect location! ,"We have just spent a fabulous week at Hilton Bankside! I could not recommend this hotel enough, nothing was a problem from concierge , to housekeeping, front office and  food and beverage staff. It is a great location, easy walking to the riverside and then on to Westminster/the Eye and everything in between. Everyone deserves a shout out but especially John, Head of concierge and Daniel the Doorman , superb. Thanks again! ",5,2023,12,15
120,Consistently excellent,"Think this was the sixth or seventh stay here and it has been excellent every time.
Check in very friendly and efficient and managed to get a room well before official check in time.
Exec lounge is one of the best with good selection of food and drink and amazing staff.
Pool is a really good added bonus as well.
Great selection of food at breakfast.",5,2023,12,10
120,Great Stay,Great stay. Large clean rooms. Efficient check in. Good breakfast and worth doing that. The lounge for honors was nice. We thought it was a good location. After doing the Eye and walking along Southbank it was an easy walk back to hotel. Would not hesitate staying here again. ,5,2023,12,10
120,Lying and deceitful ,"Room and service extremely mediocre. After stay care lacking. Not sure why this place got 5 stars having stayed in other 5 star hotels within the Hilton family such as the Trafalgar in London. 

Positives: Location, good sized rooms 
Negatively: post stay experience.

Security deposit taken upon check in of £100. Appreciate this isn’t a huge amount however promised this would be returned within 3 working days when checking in. Checked out and a week later still no refund of security deposit. 

Contacted hotel directly who claimed they had returned the deposit and to contact our bank. Bank confirmed hotel lying and to contact hotel. Contacted head office who then said the hotel had not released funds (as of day 14) despite hotel confirming directly that fund hasd been released and that an instruction had now been sent to the bank. Funds finally released on day 30 following stay! Not sure why the hotel decided to lie and claim they had released the funds on checkout when they hadn’t. Absolutely zero compensation or apology received from the hotel! Be warned this seems to be a common theme with this hotel if you read other reviews! ",1,2023,12,08
120,An excellent choice for a London Hotel,"Warm and welcoming staff greeted us on arrival.  Although we had a basic twin room as here with my granddaughter, it was of an unexpectedly good size, with a generous bathroom. The shower was  fabulous - spacious and powerful.  I will return here with my husband in the future, as the hotel is in a very good position for visiting many of the popular sights of central London.",5,2023,12,08
120,Underwhelmed,Disappointing customer service. Move our booking from sea containers to Hilton Bankside after a recommendation that they were extremely child friendly. We’ve found the customer service to be anything but. From a check in experience where they tried to give us a twin room when we had clearly booked a king to an under whelming experience with reception/room service where they tried to charge £5 for an empty plate for us to use to feed the baby. Maybe we’ve been spoilt with previous London hotels but our experience unfortunately means we won’t be returning.,2,2023,12,08
120,Christmas feelings at Hilton Bankside ,"The Visier Inc. EMEA team stayed in the Hilton Bankside to come together for our Christmas Party. 

We had a wonderful time. Very nice rooms, very good breakfast, excellent drinks and a superb service by Daniel Doorman and his colleagues. 

The Bankside area is beautiful and impressive. 

Thanks you team Hilton for the wonderful time. 

Kerstin",5,2023,12,08
120,Christmassy and lovely staff,Great staff - good location - Daniel the doorman and Ms Baby in dining were especially kind - we will be back! Foyer smelt wonderful and rooms were a little dark but clean and spacious bathrooms. The mulled wine at reception gratefully received and some great Christmas singers!,5,2023,12,08
120,Best Hilton ,"Wow what a hotel the best Hilton by far I went  with my partner and we was welcomed by keya who I had spoke to via Hilton chat app she was wonderful in arranging a celebration pack for us and a very good room, I can not fault the hotel or its service we have stayed 2 times so far this year and returning again very soon.

",5,2023,12,07
120,Excellent,"Good location. Just a few blocks from the Tate Museum and other interesting places. Excellent customer services and super friendly staff. They all made our stay really enjoyable. Spotless clean and well maintained. We ate breakfast and dinner one day, it was very nice. My family and I loved it. We truly recommend.
",5,2023,12,06
120,5 STARS - London hotel of choice,"Couples - we stayed in an executive room with a view of Great Suffolk Street, 3rd floor for 3 nights, costing around £400 per night including breakfast and use of executive lounge. For the central location and service provided we feel this is certainly value for money. The lobby’s Christmas decor was minimal but impactful, tastefully done!

The doorman, Daniel, presents himself well. He meets and greets upon arrival. We arrived from Waterloo via Uber (this is an easy walk, however we had multiple large suitcases). Daniel
Made himself available throughout our stay, he was a pro at making us feel welcome and at ease. 

Check-in, we were greeted with some mulled wine and water, there is a cart of sweets/candy you can help yourself to, which is a nice touch. There were issues with the tech upon arrival, the staff made a conscious effort to update us, e.g should be another 5 mins and directed us to the next available check-in desk. 5/5 for the communication and responsiveness.

The room was immaculately clean, a large TV, super king bed, feather and down duvet and pillows, very soft cotton to touch. Easy access to ambient room lighting & USB ports - bedside. Elegant mood lighting around the ceiling, floor to ceiling black-out curtains for ultimate privacy. The bathroom was a good size with bath and shower, robes and slippers were included in our stay. There is an integrated Bose speaker in the ceiling of the bathroom, you can listen to the TV or music while getting ready. Ample storage, hanger space, safe and luggage holder in room. Turn down service free of charge in executive rooms, the staff place your slippers on a mat beside the bed - this was a nice surprise after an intense night out.

We used room service frequently, we never had to wait long, a proactive staff. Food service is available to the room until 11pm the chicken club sandwich was slightly on the pricey side at £35 with a coke (including service charge). However, it was a good sandwich.

You are provided a breakfast menu to hang on the door by 3am to receive breakfast to the room if you’d prefer. NOTE: If you have breakfast already included you only pay for the service charge for in-room dining. However, you can use the OXBO restaurant or the executive lounge (if in exec room) breakfast buffet until 11am. 

The Distillery bar next door has a good cocktail menu. I had a whiskey sour (off-menu) and a French 75. Both tasted good, ordered multiple, attentive staff, relaxing environment.

To conclude: A modern hotel in a great location 5 star service, 5 stars for communication and responsiveness 5 stars for cleanliness, 5 stars for ambience.

We will certainly be making this our hotel of choice when visiting London - thank you for a great stay.",5,2023,12,04
120,Mediocre; I’d opt for somewhere else next time,"Overall the experience was mediocre. It’s in a decent area close to the river, about 8mins walk to the tube which is not terrible, but with our luggage I wish it’s closer. Took 1.5hours each way from the airport.

Received email notification that we were upgraded to the deluxe room, but they still gave us a very basic room on 3rd floor with a view looking out to an alleyway. Room was small, nothing like the pictures online, bathroom was updated and very nice. We arrived early and was told they will send us a text when our room was ready. Waited 2 hours in the lounge, never got the text so we went out. Room was ready when we got back in the evening and front desk just handed over the keys without any rundown. There were no acknowledgement of my Diamond status and at check-in nor any briefing of where's breakfast, breakfast times, happy hour times etc. Still never received the promised text that our room was ready. Breakfast was a nice spread albeit exactly the same every morning.

It was ok but I’d stay somewhere else next time",3,2023,12,02
120,Daniel’s fantastic service!,"Daniel the doorman was very kind and helpful. He ordered us a cab, carried our bags and packed them into the car for us! He made our commute to the airport stress free! Moreover, he had such a great energy that was a warm welcome on an early morning. Whatever the Hilton is paying him is not enough! ",5,2023,12,02
120,"Great hotel, good location","Had a great time at the Hilton Bankside.  The rooms were lovely and very clean. Daniel the doorman was friendly and helpful, as were all the staff there. Reception staff were efficient, and provided a much appreciated upgrade. We also had the brunch, which was amazing. Would highly recommend.",5,2023,12,01
120,Amazing exec lounge ,Amazing exec lounge with plenty of room and above and beyond service. One of the best lounges in London by far. Great place to relax or get some work done. Thank you Yen and Rachit for the excellent service. ,5,2023,11,30
120,Festive holiday stay ,"Hotel was very nice with great service. Beautifully decorated and festive. 
Cart of candy waiting for the kids in the lobby at check in. 
Beds are comfortable. 

Location was good- near Tate modern, southbank, walking distance to metro, national theater and London eye with an Amazon fresh store and wagamama just around the corner. 

Daniel the doorman was especially helpful! He really made our stay special! 

The hotel has a scavenger hunt with a fox theme and the kids loved searching for the foxes every day.

A couple of things that could have made it even better: 

Add more vegan/dairy free options at breakfast. (They could accommodate for omelettes on request) Maybe add some more pastry options or vegan cheese. 

Add a hair dryer to the room. 

Provide a couple of bottles of water to the rooms.  ",5,2023,11,30
120,Daniel doorman was very helpful. Thank you Daniel.,Daniel Doorman was super professional and very friendly. We would like to give him a special word that he was really helpful. We were struggling order Uber and he even helped us to move such a huge luggages to the other side of the property because of the road closures. Thank you Daniel.,5,2023,11,30
120,Bottomless brunch is true to its word,"We had the warmest and friendliest of greetings when we arrived from Daniel (doorman) and he continued to be just as warm and friendly throughout our stay.
Sadly I didn’t get anyone else’s name but all staff from front desk to restaurant staff were so lovely.  Bottomless brunch is great value for money, food is spot on and the glass never goes below halfway (unless you firm it in one I suppose).",5,2023,11,28
120,"Great location, friendly staff.",This is a great place to be based for a trip to London. Very central the staff were very welcoming with a mince pie a d mulled wine on arrival. The room looked over the central courtyard area so it was very quiet if a little dark due to lack of windows. It was spotless and well equipped. The Executive Lounge was excellent. Lots to choose from with eating and drinking and a layout reminiscent of a front room at home. Breakfast was very impressive too. Overall it was excellent.,5,2023,11,28
120,"Amazing hotel, great service, and a terrific location","We visited this fantastic hotel as a family of 4 (w/2 pre-teen kids) from the US and loved it. 

Check-In: Seamless and smooth. We arrived at the hotel at 10AM (overnight flight) and stored our bags before heading to enjoy the city.  Our room was ready around 1PM (received a text), which we were thankful for.   

Rooms: We booked 2 connecting rooms (King/King) based on availability and were upgraded as Diamonds to a (King/Twin) connecting room (with a Peloton bike!). This was a fantastic upgrade and truly appreciated (especially by our kids).  We were on the 2nd floor and experienced no hallway or street noise, which was a wonderful surprise. We were also celebrating our 15 year anniversary and received a lovely cake.

Breakfast: Breakfast as Diamonds was amazing, perhaps the best we've had at a hotel. We ate breakfast in the restaurant during the week and at the Executive Lounge during the weekends. 

Executive Lounge: Fantastic all around. Terrific service especially by Yen, Terrence, and Kadiatu, who not only looked after us personally, but our kids too.  Evening hours were daily from 6-8pm and included food, dessert, and drinks.  Some days were busier than others, but we always found a table.

Pool: Clean and warm - kids loved it. 

Location: The location ended up being a nice surprise.  It was really hard to gauge from maps and reviews, but we ended wanting to walk everywhere. We walked to Hyde Park, Westminster, Big Ben, National Gallery, the British Museum, St. Paul's, and the Tower of London.   The British Museum felt about 10 minutes too long, but we made it. In the evenings, we either took an Uber or the Tube back to the hotel. Both Blackfriars and Southwark are very convenient to the hotel. We never felt unsafe (but we were never out past 7PM....).

We have stayed at a lot of Hiltons all over the world, and this hotel easily ranks in our top 5.  Highly recommend, especially for a family.",5,2023,11,27
120,last minute cycling trip to London Hilton Bankside,"We booked 2 nights here at the last minute and had a lovely stay on Saturday 25th and Sunday 26th November. Very comfortable and well equiped room and a lovely swimming pool.We travelled by train and bicycle and were a bit alarmed to find that the Hilton doesn't provide secure cycle parking (only for cars!)
Fortunately your fantastically helpful doorman Daniel and his duty manager went out of their way to help us and found a safe place to store our bikes overnight on the Saturday. They understood our problem and were quick to find a solution.
Sadlyy on the Sunday evening we had a very unhelpful manager who said it was against policy to store bicycles and left us standing in the cold while she went to ask someone. We gave up after waiting for her and took the bikes to our room - not ideal.
I hope the management follow Daniel's example and find a system to support cycling guests!",4,2023,11,27
120,Great service!,"Daniel, the doorman, truly elevated my stay with his warm welcome and attentive assistance. His genuine hospitality and professionalism made me feel valued from the moment I arrived, setting the tone for an outstanding experience. Highly recommend for those seeking a memorable and welcoming stay.",5,2023,11,26
120,Great venues for a conference,"We attended an awards dinner last night  with at lease 250 people at this hotel. 

I want to congratulate all their team on an amazing job! 

All too often at these kind of events the dinner and table service is poor to say the least. Catering for such large numbers and getting all the food out in a timely fashion is a big challenge. They delivered first class cuisine with military precision. Thank you and well done.

If you’re looking for a venue for a conference or event, this place is great!",5,2023,11,25
120,Great hotel & team,"Decent sized room. Large shower room Comfy large bed, Amazingly soundproofed room. Good breakfast and  bar. All the staff are very professional and helpful. Walking distance to all the tourist attractions of central London",5,2023,11,24
120,Great food and service in the bar,"Excellent food and warm, friendly and attentive service by Coumba consistently on both evenings we were there. The room was comfortable, the self service breakfast comprehensive and the swimming pool is long surrounded by relaxing lounging recliners and plenty of towels.",5,2023,11,23
120,Nice stay ,I stayed here for a few nights on a trip for work.  The check in process was quite easy as there was no line and the people were very nice.   The hotel is fairly modern and was in a decent location for walking.  The pillows were very soft which I like.  It was very clean. The executive lounge was nice and breakfast was very well done. A nice place.,5,2023,11,21
120,Memories and Moments for a lifetime ,"Great Hotel, amazing team!! 1st visit to London and I traveled with my partner who’s life dream was to visit London and experience the city and all its attractions. With the help of the hotel team we enjoyed the city fully, each person we interacted with made great recommendations for us. Simply put, it’s because of the team the we enjoyed this trip to the fullest. 

Back to the hotel and the quality of the room and other facilities. Very good and high standard. 

There are so many people to mention but I would not want to leave anyone’s name out so I’ll just say, “thank you to all of you! This visit was very special to us”. 

There is one person I do need to mention that went above and beyond in his service, John - Head Concierge, You dear Sir, you’re a Legend!! Because of you we will cherish our London experience for the rest of our lives. For that I thank you! ",5,2023,11,21
120,Always welcomed back with a smile- the team that want to make your stay great,"Nice to be back at the bankside after a 6 week absence!  As usual, Ali Asgar and his colleague Daniel cooked up a feast of cracking eggs and stunning pancakes at breakfast.   
John at the concierge desk, always willing to help, with a helping of humour, arranged transport for my meeting to West London. Back in the evening, at the lounge, Yin as usual was on hand keeping the lounge in top condition and well stocked. 
Always a pleasure to get back to the bankside! ",5,2023,11,20
120,A 2* experience for a 50th birthday,"Extremely disappointed by our recent visit. It was my husbands 50th birthday & I ordered a bottle of champagne & balloons for the room, instead of the standard package.  On arrival it was not in the room; which was a massive let down given the occasion.  I walked to Reception to let them know and despite there being a promise it would be rectified, 45 minutes after we checked in, we were still not in receipt of it and chose to leave the room - the moment had been missed….and could not be regained.

On leaving the room, we went to the restaurant, where one person on the desk was on the phone and extremely busy / stressed - we left as there was nobody else there to speak to.  We then went to the bar, where were told to take a seat, but it took some time to be served. We were served eventually and from that point the experience improved.

I chose the Hilton as it was a special occasion and we had previously had a good experience for my husbands birthday a few years back.  I did not want to take a risk on a poor experience.  Sadly, that is exactly what we got. A massive disappointment - not even rectified in a timely way, or made up for in any way. 

 A 5 star service has not been maintained; the hotel appears under-resourced and simple service severely lacking.  Ordinarily it would not mean so much - but for a one off birthday, I hoped and expected  a lot more!

Go to CitizenM close by - the room may not be large, but the beds are far more comfortable and service far superior at half the cost! I wish I had stayed there again! At least it is consistent! ",2,2023,11,20
120,Rachit & Tarrane 10/10,"Rachit & Tarrane were wonderful and gave an exceptional quality of service at the executive lounge. I was attended to at all times and had a fantastic experience. I highly recommend the Hilton London Bankside and am looking forward to my next stay. Thank you! 
- Lindsay T.",5,2023,11,18
120,Outstanding Executive Lounge,"Hilton's executive lounge impressed me with their attentive service and a calming ambiance. Rachit and Tarranc were standout servers, enhancing my entire  experience. Highly recommend for a tranquil and top-notch vibe during your Hilton stay.",5,2023,11,18
120,Dreadful,"Stayed here for a short work visit, and this is a hotel that looks fine at first but is a mess to work in. No working outlets, awkwardly designed space (hidden closets, no iron), and weird inexplicable stains on the sheet in one of the beds? Area is also surprisingly loud at night which didn’t help with jet lag at all. Definitely not worth the stay.

There are much more centrally located hotels. I chose this one because I used to live near by, but wouldn’t come back.",1,2023,11,17
120,Business and pleasure at The Hilton Bankside,Fantastic hotel in the centre of London and very accessible for the city. Staff were outstanding and the food and facilities second to none. Really enjoyed my visit. We were looked after from the minute we arrived and nothing was impossible if it was needed. A special mention for Daniel the doorman who was the most helpful and good humoured guy to meet. 10/10 for his attention. I will be back,5,2023,11,17
120,Fantastic Daniel!,"Our experience was truly exceptional, largely thanks to Daniel, the doorman. From the moment we stepped in, his warmth and friendliness were unparalleled, creating an atmosphere that made us feel genuinely welcome. Daniel's remarkable personality added an extra layer of enjoyment to our time. We are sincerely grateful for his outstanding service and believe he deserves a well-earned pay raise for his contributions to our positive experience.",5,2023,11,16
120,Exceptional service as always,"We have been staying at the Hilton Bankside for quite a few years now and wouldn’t stay anywhere else in London. Location is great, rooms are lovely and spacious but what makes this hotel special is the staff.  You cannot fault the service, they are friendly and always go above and beyond. As soon as you walk into the lobby, you are greeted with a smile, an amazing aroma  and a glass of Prosecco - what more could you ask for. A special mention to John and Daniel who always look after us, and also Johann, who we met for the first time and who made our trip extra special.",5,2023,11,12
120,Ideal location ,"Ideal location, only 30 minutes from Euston Station & quiet rooms. The warm welcome upon arrival was great, an outstanding Romanian staff member greeted us with some prosecco which really set the tone of the stay. We used the small pool but I prefer a sauna or steam room too, swim towels provided in the lockers.
We did not eat in the hotel as we like go explore but it looked lovely and was busy.  We would recommend the Bankside cafe for the hugest fry up plate ever - £7, so busy with locals and 7 minute walk (cashing en route). We also tried black sheep but their breakfast rolls were disappointing prepacked, warmed up, non crispy so stick to coffee there.
Southbank underground is a few minutes walk, also Waterloo.
 The Tate Modern is a 2 minute walk, also a Leon (great fresh, affordable non beige food even for young kids) and waggamamas. 
Ventured to soho in the evenings as underground line 24/7 and liked the arts theatre club which is free before 1030pm and £10 thereafter, small but great atmosphere with 80/90/00s music so had a boogie. There was also a jazz & salsa club but queues were huge so never made it. Lots of street food so don't need to book restaurants, check out seven dials food market. 
Check out Leicester square box-office for last minute show tickets.
Thank you Bankside and Hilton Honours team for a great stay. ",5,2023,11,12
120,Fantastic city break!!!,"The room was spacious and perfect. The lounge was exceptional and the staff (Rachit, Kaditu, Rees) were attentive and extremely helpful. The location is perfect for the surrounding attractions. We will definitely return. ",5,2023,11,11
120,Hidden Gem hotel behind the Tate Modern,"This is my favorite hotel in central London, proved by the fact I have stayed there over thirty times! Why you may ask? 

The location, just behind the Tate Modern and the wobbly bridge enable me to walk to all my meetings in the City and around the Lloyds building. 

The staff are amazing and welcome you as soon as you walk in the door. John Kortenray provides a fantastic concierge service, nothing is too much trouble and the breakfasts are an experience you dont want to miss. The chef there is Ali Asgav prepares omelets and eggs to suit your taste - delicious. 

The executive lounge is spacious and the staff and food are great. 

The OXO restaurant and bar have a varied menu and range of drinks - all at reasonable prices. 

The rooms are not only well designed and very clean, they are extremely comfortable. 

We left the hotel this morning to head home but already looking forward to our next stay. 

Hope you find this revue helpful. 

George",5,2023,11,11
120,"My ""Go To""in London","Great hotel, good food, very kind staff - Alluesh made extra effort at breakfast to ensure i had what i needed with  no fuss and a gentle smile.  

Big brand hotels can sometimes be anonymous but i feel like this this Hilton seems to get a good balance between professional and personal, giving space when needed but still personal and attentive too",5,2023,11,08
120,One nighter,"Very inclusive culture with extremely polite staff members! Great atmosphere
Ashok was also very proactive in welcoming us at the restaurant, ensuring our requests to the kitchen could be granted and we could have a great dinner. Thank you Ashok!",5,2023,11,05
120,Back to the Bankside,"As a diamond Hilton member I spend a lot of my time in Hilton hotels and the Bankside is absolutely up there as one of my favourites. I first discovered the Bankside in 2016 when I held a charity fashion show for children in need in their amazing ballroom and the staff and the facilities were excellent then and they haven’t diminished with time! It’s such a stylish hotel with stunning rooms and the staff are very, very nice and very, very professional. We had a great experience with everyone we dealt with but will single out dashing  Daniel the doorman who made us feel so welcome (not to mention plying us with Prosecco) and also lovely Sheshik who served us in the OXBO where we had the November special  cheese and charcutetie board and cocktail. The breakfast is also worthy of mention and the ambience of the restaurant is very calming. In conclusion could not recommend the Hilton Bankside enough - and it’s also in a great place for access to all the main parts of London.",5,2023,11,05
120,Excellent stay in London,"Stayed here for 3 nights with my family in 2-connecting rooms back in June 2023. Location is not very ideal (quiet neighbourhood) because it is not very close to tourist attractions and no direct access to subway train station (need about 7-8 min walk to the nearest Southwark subway station). However, the top-notch stay comfort, great staff service and excellent breakfast have made it up. 

The rooms were very comfortable and clean, no complaint. Mini bar in the room has complimentary snacks/biscuits and drinks, a small token which could bring cheer to guests. Breakfast at OXBO was fantastic, we were spoilt with wide choices, exceptionally good quality pastries, hot meal (like waffle) was very delicious. My kids just loved everything served during breakfast. There were vegan selections as well, like almond and oat milk, plant-based yogurts and etc.",5,2023,11,05
120,Best customer service,I had an amazing stay at Hilton London Bankside. The rooms are lovely and clean. Definitely the 5-star experience! The food in the restaurant was delicious and all the star really friendly! I would like to say a special thank you to Chrissa the guest relation manager for giving us a lovely room on the high floor like we requested and was always there to help when we needed anything! Highly recommend.,5,2023,11,03
120,Wonderful stay.,"From the moment we arrived the service was excellent. Room clean. Reception staff good. Bed so comfortable. Loved the way room serviced. High light after a busy sight seeing day was the executive lounge. We have stayed in Hilton across the world and this was the best experience we have had had. Our gratitude to Fiadiatu, Terence and Rachit they gave exceptional service. Hilton should be so proud of them. Thank you for a lovely stay. Will be back again next year.Don’t forget to search for the foxes.",5,2023,11,03
120,Diamond happy hour,"Service's in executive lounge is simply friendly and professional. Well done Terence, Kadiah and Rachit !! With unlimited flow of sparkling, wine and soft drinks. Lounge itself is also with good ambience and relax.",5,2023,11,03
120,It was a pleasure to stay at London Hilton Bankside for 5 nights.,"We had a wonderful stay in this Hilton Hotel. The location is so perfect for any kind of activity in the City of London. The Hotel Bar OXBO is fantastic and especially the service of Mr Sam Singh has been outstanding. He knows everything about fine drinks, an expert for Gin and Whiskey and in addition so nice and kind. It was a pleasure. The breakfast at this Hilton Hotel has to be commended, too. You get an absolutely personalized service and many items are freshly made on order. The kitchen staff is unbelievably amazing. Really high class experience. 5 Stars!",5,2023,11,03
120,Beware the £50 deposit...,"First impressions were good.  Friendly reception team and a glass of prosecco on arrival.  We had an executive room on the 6th floor. The room was huge and looked great but was impractical with lots of wasted space. I had to hunt for a full-length mirror which was inside the wardrobe door in the corner of the room so it couldn't open fully.  The lights were all or nothing but the room was still dull and a tiny desktop mirror was hidden in a black box on the desk which I initially thought was for the tea and coffee!  Another Hilton I use regularly always has a complimentary bottle of wine in the room but there is nothing like that here.

Nice bar, very quiet early in the evening but we still had to chase up staff to take our order.  All public areas are modern and immaculate. 

A decent enough stay but we wouldn't go back. The final thing that resulted in that decision is the £50 deposit taken at check-in does not get refunded when you check out.  Apparently, it will take at least a week to process but conveniently went into the hotel account instantly.  Other Hilton hotels I use just take £1 to check the card.  After paying a premium for the room in the first place the extra charge and long refund time was an unwelcome additional expense.  
",3,2023,11,03
120,Great guest  service ,"Enjoyed my stay, decent rooms, good breakfast and overall very good service by staff. Especially want to compliment John concierge/ front desk for his excellent customer service. He has an engaging manner, volunteers to help, finds solutions, gives great advice  and goes out of his way to make try to find  what you are looking for. Thank you all, kudos to John",4,2023,11,03
120,The distillery ,"I would like to give a special mention to Suzy and Ricardo, our waiters at The Distillery restaurant. They were both very friendly and knowledgeable, and they provided us with excellent service. They were able to answer all of our questions about the menu and make recommendations based on our preferences. They also made sure that we had everything we needed throughout our meal. Thank you, Suzy and Ricardo, for making our dining experience so enjoyable!",5,2023,11,02
120,Conference venue,"A good location for a conference with many transport links nearby. Everything was very well managed, and staff were polite and helpful when needed. Thank you especially to Jumana for your kind service! ",5,2023,11,02
120,"Comfortable, relaxing, enjoyable - The hotel you wished you could always stay at on business!","The hotel's ambiance and general set up is great. The areas are generally relaxing and lighting set to be slightly darker than usual but this seems to offset London's generally fast-paced nature.

The rooms are tastefully appointed, very clean and very comfortable with a sleek modern and tiled/laminate flooring finish. The bathrooms are also modern and fresh looking. There's clearly a lot of care to decorate and maintain the rooms in general.

The exec lounge is probably one of the best in London, although closely rivalled by the IHG Intercontinental Park Lane (except this is £100 per night more on average!). The service I received on the night I stayed by Rachit, Sahil and Kadiatu was fantastic - thank you for your wonderful proactive service and warmth during happy hour!

Overall, this is one of my favourite mid-upper hotels in London and hope it continues to do what is does. 

Lovely stay.",5,2023,10,30
120,Nice Hotel - Executive Lounge Upgrade is a ripoff,"The executive lounge upgrade was the biggest piece of garbage I have ever encountered. I feel ripped off. The room also wasn't ready when I arrived and I wasn't told when it would be ready and I wasn't called when it was ready. The actual room was nice, the bed was comfortable and the shower was enjoyable. But the executive lounge with no food, no breakfast during the week, no alcoholic beverages, and no benefits whatsoever - was a giant waste of my money. ",3,2023,10,30
120,Modern but AMAZING Hilton should be 4 stars,"From the moment you walk off taxi and check in you are going to be treated like a Hilton Honor Member. We had just transfered from the Park Hilton in london and yes that is historically beautiful but ill Bankside every day! 
The staff is beyond words amazing I cant remember everyone but because of Kamaal I have 2 foxes to hide around the house. But there is also a french? Concierge who is there that is beyond words ""Hilton Pride"" 
As a loyal Hilton family member dont read these pointless reviews this hotel is amazing!! I spotted 49 foxes..play the game its fun! I love you Bankside see you soon!",5,2023,10,29
120,"Greatest staff, but overall not 5*","Can absolutely recommend the executive lounge, staff is the friendliest and most helpful I‘ve ever experienced as one of Hilton‘s Diamond Members. Special shoutout to Sahil & Terence who went above and beyond for a special request I had.
Rooms and friendlyness of front desk staff on the other hand is not quite what you would expect from a Hotel of this class. Umbrellas can only be borrowed for a 2£ fee or bought for 20£, this service should be standard and free of charge, as was in all Hilton‘s (incl. DoubleTree) I‘ve been…",5,2023,10,29
120,Superb lounge.,"Terence and Sahil made our stay. Very friendly and welcoming! 

Good service, polite and attentive. Seasonal decorations and themes. Well recommend. 

Good location, close to public transport links - easy to get into London. Lots of food options around too.",5,2023,10,29
120,Superb.,Another excellent stay at this lovely hotel. Beautiful rooms & contemporary decor throughout which is extremely well maintained & still feels brand new. The pool is fantastic & the breakfast excellent. Great location. Special thanks to Kim for making our stay extra special. Highly recommend.,5,2023,10,29
120,Great service ,Kadiaiu was brilliant. So attentive in the executive lounge. Such a sweet person and made sure she was there for anything you needed. Great service would highly recommend visiting the executive  lounge especially in the evening ,5,2023,10,27
120,Great Lounge And Overall Experience ,"Exceptional executive lounge! The hospitality team from Sahil, Terence, Kadiatu and especially Yen were spot on at all times. Also, Daniel welcomed us with such friendliness and kindness! We will definitely be back. The morning breakfast spread was exceptional as well. Beautiful gym and pool area as well. Our one disappointment was the pool had a separated section with jets, but was not a hot tub. Everything else about this hotel was top notch. Highly recommend. ",5,2023,10,27
120,Perfect lounge experience ,"Kadiatu is really friendly and warm heart. In the past 2 weeks, I usually came to the lounge at dinner time. She always helps me with the wine and clean the table every time I went for something else. ",5,2023,10,27
120,Back here yet again. ,Extremely well-run hotel. Feels like home.  Great people and food is quite good. They make a point to remember who you are and follow through on items without restating an issue. Will definitely return.,5,2023,10,27
120,10 Stars!!!,"Nice hotel.
Comfortable beds.
AMAZING service.
Shoutout to the Doormen, especially Dianel and the tall black gentleman - they were so polite and accommodating.
Only con is the thin walls. You can hear people in the halls.

HIGHLY RECOMMEND.!!!",5,2023,10,27
120,Hilton on steroids,"Always love this hotel, Hilton turbo charged. Great location, amazing staff and the pool! I’ve been coming here for years and it never fails to deliver. The Tate, borough market, Bankside, all within reach. The breakfast 1st class and the staff amazing, john concierge, Kadiath lounge and Ali in the kitchen",5,2023,10,26
120,Lovely experience ,"Delicious food. 
Kadiatu, Yen, Terence, Chef Swapnil.
Lovely service, ambience, drinks.

120,Amazing services great memories ,Awesome service all through.  The Doormen (Daniel and all the others) are amazing.  Friendly kind helpful professional.  Can’t recommend the team and the hotel enough - look for the foxes everywhere ;),5,2023,10,26
120,My New Favorite London Hotel ,"I stay in London several times a year for work and this was the first time I have stayed at this property.  This hotel started on the right foot.  After a long day of traveling, I arrived at the hotel very late at night and the front desk staff was amazing.  I was in my upgraded room in under 15 min.  I was happy to find a personalized amenity waiting for me.  The rooms are spacious, comfortable, updated, quiet and clean.  The bathrooms are well-sized with a good amount of counter space.  The bed was super comfortable and I loved the reading lights next to it the room had plenty of outlets for me to charge my many devices.  Each day I was greeted by staff and if I had a question they were extremely helpful.    This is now my new favorite London hotel and will be booking it again soon.",5,2023,10,26
120,Great hotel!,"Hotel was extremely clean and the staff was excellent. Located very near a lot of sights we wanted to see. We stayed the first half of our visit near Trafalgar Square and then moved to the Bankside in order to be closer to other places we wanted to visit. We were happy with our first hotel so weren’t sure we wanted to move, but In the end we were so happy we did.  Loved our stay at Bankside!",5,2023,10,23
120,Made to feel special,Booked for our anniversary and we had  dinner at The Distillery. They were just fab! I’d mentioned in my booking that it was our anniversary and we got a free cocktail and a small desert with ‘congratulations’ written in chocolate! Special mention to Coumba and the funky barman (he was ace!!),5,2023,10,22
120,Another great stay in  Hilton,"Fantastic staff, thank you to the front room staff and to Sahil, Terence and Kadiatu in the executive lounge. Great location,  great room, the facilites are excellent, although to be honest all I need is nice staff and a great bar.",5,2023,10,20

120,Pleasant and professional service & support,"Excellent service by the wait staff for our business meeting. Lovy & Jumana were great. They kept the place clean, brought out fresh beverages for us, were always polite and professional.

The app requires that I write 200 characters so I’m just writing this additional sentence!",5,2023,10,20
120,Very nice Hilton. Not sure on location. ,"Perhaps one of the nicest Hilton's I have stayed in, but not in a prime location. 
Tube station is not far though and it would be fine for a visit to London, but there are others, around tower bridge for instance, that would be my preference for location. ",4,2023,10,20
120,Great event organization ,"It a great place to organize an event! Very fluent and efficient collaboration with the hotel staff. Especially Lovy and Jumana made our experience fabulous. We will be definitely coming back, the customer service is through the roof! ",5,2023,10,19
120,Excellent  hotel because of the staff,"Great hotel. The rooms were comfortable  and larger than expected.
What made this hotel special were the staff. We met and enjoyed so many of them. Here are a few that made our stay memorable.
Abi, Kamal,  Kadiatu, Yen and Sahil
Thanks to all the staff at the Hilton Lonfon Bankside.",5,2023,10,18
120,As Good as I Remember,"While it's been several years between visits, due to the pandemic, a recent four night stay here was just as good as the last time.  The only thing that's changed is that the surrounding Bankside area seems busier and trendier than it was a few years ago, but that's not a bad thing.  The location of this hotel is great for nearby restaurants, the river walk area up and down the Thames, a quick walk to a Tube station (Southwark) and a short distance from two major train stations (Waterloo and Blackfriars). 

The very good customer service at the hotel started at the front desk, where my room was ready early and check in was blissfully short.  The attention to service continued throughout our stay, particularly from Housekeeping, where the room was always cleaned upon my return and a turn down service (which included bottled water and slippers) was completed each night while I was at dinner. When I asked for a couple of extra items for the room and a bucket of ice each day (they don't have self-service ice machines like North American hotels), they were promptly delivered. 

The room itself is large by London standards, with a very comfortable bed and a well-appointed bathroom (and wonderfully large shower).  The mini-fridge was useful for storing drinks and snacks and the WiFi was quite good.  There wasn't anything I found wanting throughout the stay and the only small suggestion I could offer would be an information card in the room on how the multiple light switches work.  After four nights, I still hadn't quite figured it out.

If you're coming to London in the future, put this hotel at the top of your list.",5,2023,10,18
120,Wonderful stay and restaurant,"Hilton London Bankside is a clean and modern hotel with a staff that cannot be beat. From the concierge to regular housekeeping, it was a wonderful experience. Abi in the restaurant was a pleasure to deal with every morning as well.",5,2023,10,15

120,Disappointed in cleanliness ,"Black long hairs found in bath tub, (I'm bald and wife blonde) rang reception as its a simple mistake and not one to make an issue or get staff in trouble, offered us free breakfast. When we asked if breakfast could be room service as we booked a treat hotel stay to sleep in late as no school run, they said we would need to pay £5 extra each!!!! I declined breakfast on the principle, it costs nothing for them to offer room service and I was slightly offend at the audacity of it. Not what I expected from the HILTON",3,2023,10,06
120,Delightful stay,"This was our 2nd stay at this hotel. First time was pre pandemic. Fewer services in the executive lounge than before, but not unexpected post pandemic. Breakfast in lounge on weekends only, but full English breakfast available weekdays in the adjoining Oxbo restaurant. No afternoon tea. Evening reception with food and alcohol 6-8pm. Happy to still have an executive lounge at European Hiltons. Service all around excellent - housekeeping, front desk, concierge, doormen, lounge and restaurant staff, etc. Everyone friendly, professional, accommodating. Too many to name but especially want to acknowledge Sahil, Kadiatu, and Lucy for their hospitality every evening in the lounge.

Location is great. Short walk to tube and rail stations, Tate Modern, Shakespeare Globe theatre, boardwalk along South bank of Thames, Borough Market. Nearby Southwark Cathedral is worth a visit.",5,2023,10,05
120,Excellent Weekend Stay,"Very very happy with our visit here, would not hesitate in recommending and am looking forward to returning. Facilities here are excellent and the rooms very very clean and well looked after. Staying in London always presents a risk of noise but the sound proofing at this hotel is excellent, you hear nothing of what’s going on outside at all. Breakfast is excellent and the Omelette chef is a complete star. Every member of staff that we encountered was nothing other than professional and immaculately attired. The Hilton Bankside really is worth a visit.",5,2023,10,04
120,Outstanding experience,"Pros: Tasteful decoration. The shower has excellent water pressure, good quality toiletries. Staff was super welcoming and nice. Location is just perfect, close to the Tate, the Thames and plenty other attractions. Food was great. It was also very quiet, which is crucial for me as I am a light sleeper. Pool area is warm, which makes going for a swim really pleasant. The gym is also well equipped for its size. Everything was very clean.
By far, the best Hilton I’ve stayed in. 

Cons: Mattress was a bit too soft for my liking. I am quite light and felt like I was sinking in a whole in the middle of the bed. 

All in all, I Would definitely stay there again! ",5,2023,10,02
120,Amazing service ,"Patrick and Livia were amazing, the service that they provided was excellent and the food fantastic too.
Please try the waffles and all the deserts that you will find in the chef’s traders table.
We will definitely come back!",5,2023,10,01
120,Great Hotel in London,"My wife and I stayed several nights at the London Bankside. The service was exceptional the entire stay. We were greeted at our cab and all luggage deliver to our room. Being a Hilton Diamond member, we had access to the Lounge. The Lounge for Hilton Honors members was awesome and welcome after a long day. 
Breakfast was excellent, one of the best in the Hilton hotel chain. 
Our Room was clean and very comfortable. Bed was comfortable and the water for the shower was hot. Again, the staff was incredible.
My one issue was with the female manager. I had forgotten to exchange my US dollars at the Airport. We were on our way out the first night and I asked the front desk if I could exchange $200 US to British. I was told the manager would take care of it but was busy at the time. I came back later and gave the desk person my cash to exchange. The manager came out and had me sign for the exchange and then counted out 126 British for the $200 US. I did expect a bit of a charge for the Exchange, but thought 20% was way out of line. We were on our way to dinner and I didn't have the time to question the Exchange cost. 
Otherwise- the entire stay was amazing. ",5,2023,09,30
120,"Once is a mistake , twice  deserves a chance but 3  times !! Never again","So after the worst experience back in June , I made the complaint , nothing happened , I was promised by Kim it would be looked into
And they would contact me back ,  ……. I’ve had absolutely zero contact with any body from Hilton, Ithe amount of money I lost and having had to pay for another night because of Hilton
Staff , they really should have done
The right thing , I thought the least is the night back I paid for given back in  points or something if nero refund 
 even went on to write a lengthy email  deeper explaining relaying what’ happened , Ibut never heard anything back since .
I decided to give the place one more try , it’s not like  the place is not amazing  , plus it was the only  time I could celebrate my birthday which followed a week later.
I was greeted by an East African lady who was so nice and really made me and my brother who arrived shortly after feel so much better , she was able to do an upgrade which is always nice and the lovely concierge Caribbean guy who always makes me feel so welcome when I’ve stayed oferring us champagne’s as we arrived.
I saw the manager and some of the staff from last time ,  I’m now positive. In  fact I know for sure they new who I was because one of the staff told me on the phone. I’ll get to this!! I finished my work and we had a bottle and went down to the exec lounge ! I felt like the whole time  we were there in the executive lounge or
  Even  every time we pass receptions and then whispers then start  . The next day after breakfast i asked if it was possible to have a late checkout  but because I couldn’t remember Ithe room number , I was told call down when I get to the room , I rang several times and no answer then a thud at the door  , a lady stood asking what am I doing in here so I told her this was my room from last night, she just replied it’s not only paperwork’s and  walked away leaving my jaw hitting the floor.
The pho rang , the same person who I asked about the late check out called except she’s not nice anymore, asking me all
RThe questions about my reservation  , how I checked in and do I have a key, I didn’t know what was going on but I was feeling very uneasy .
I went down to reception and walked to the desk, I asked is there a problem because the phone call i just received was not nice and I told  her I’ve had problems here
Previous and  she replied  snappily , I know who you are from the last time , by this time the whole desks are looking at me and looking at the pc screen  at the same time , security had been called one behind
oAnd one at the side of the desk  so , security, 2 /3 receptionists, 1 male manager and a lady all stood around me , the manager all asking me all these questions , who checked me in  what time did i get there how many keys were I given , all this  and no explanation until finally tone of the receptionists said we know you hadn’t done anything fraudulent but we had to check  And rule you out and that they saw my check in on the cctv  they realised that a mistake occurred and my check in  had checked me in somewhere else , after almost what felt like a lifetime  of being looked and whispered at like a criminal  I was given no apology , the same manager who’s always told use said nothing and after lr all that I was told I could have till 1 pm for my late check out  and if I wanted more or stay over 1 minute more I’d be charged  as that’s the policy, another thing they like doing … making up rules as they go along.
I left not even 10 minutes after …….I just wanted to get off that property and never return which I will not 
It’s absolutely ridiculous how I’ve been treated both times  , I’m glad my brother was there because he confirmed that it was rhappening  there were a couple I had met who were in reception who Whitness ex the whole thing , I got there details they told me they would happily sop port me if I complained .  I’m a man of colour and I can only assume they do this to me was for 1 reason only and I’m fact I’m not assuming I know. It’so actually a shame because it’s a fantastic place but the staff will be in the end be a down fall.  
I feel very disappointed that  no one even bothered to reply back to my email or follow up on any complaints I raised 
I actually feel like taking my status as a diamond member and joint another loyalty group that may match it and appreciate to he fact I choose to stay in Hilton hotels  sometimes over  long periods but  mostly on a weekly basis , I’d also like the managing directors details please !  I’m no longer going to be disrespected.",1,2023,09,30
120,More than just a night at a hotel,Best Hotel experience so far! Me and my husband got a glas of champagne from Piocensca in the lobby who checked us in and gave us the best start of our stay. She made us feel so special and she was so kind and helpful! The room was so peaceful to stay in for the weekend and we got a special gift sent up to the room on my husband’s birthday! The breakfast was amazing and tops most hotels easy. We are definitely coming back here. ,5,2023,09,30

120,Cozy lounge with plenty of elbow room. A tasty selection of food and snacks along with libations!the champagne was nice!,"Great lounge !
Sanchita, Yen & Kaoliato provided exceptional service at the table and at the bar!
  The room is large and dimly lit with a wonderful fireplace and large screen TVs in the center.
  Tell me a nice ambient music in the background and wonderful to and for top tables throughout with velvet and leather chairs and couches at each table.
  Do you have a basic but well stock of libations and beverages even a nice champagne that was quite cold and the girls pour and bring to the table…
  We visit a lot of Marriott properties in this is by far one of our favorite lounges, so I hope you get a chance to come and experience yourself!",5,2023,09,28
120,Exceptional Bankside,"Having stayed in many Hilton properties in London over the last 4 years without question the Hilton London Bankside delivers the best guest experience which is why this hotel is now our corporate go to for any stays in London.
All staff deliver an exceptional guest experience which makes this hotel a home from home. 
As a Hilton Diamond member consistency is what I look for most in a hotel stay and without question this hotel delivers on all counts. I’m currently on what must be my 50th stay at the hotel and each has been consistently excellent.
I know this starts with the management who are evidently doing an excellent job of ensuring the staff understand the importance of guest experience. Whilst all staff deliver a great experience some go significantly above and beyond. Yen in the executive lounge is a true star and a credit to the hotel. She provides such a friendly and personal service to all guests and without question is one of the best members of the team and deserves true recognition by the management.  Daniel provides the most amazing welcome each and every time who always welcomes with a smile. I look forward to many more exceptional stays to come.",5,2023,09,28

120,Great hotel,Excellent hotel. Staff great and attentive. Clean and quiet rooms. A/c works. Great location.  Comfy beds. I would stay here and have stayed here often.

Zuzana / Federica / Zain / Patel / Yen / Ismaeel / Ammar / Chef Ali and many many more but unfortunately I don’t know their names.",5,2023,09,20
120,"Good hotel, great service","My wife and I recently spent a week at the Hilton Bankside hotel. We were impressed with the cleanliness and amenities provided. As Diamond members, we also like the Executive Lounge, which we used quite a bit. It is a bit of a haven from the general hubbub of a busy hotel. One thing that struck us about the Lounge was the level of friendliness and eagerness to please from the Lounge staff. (A shoutout to Yen, Sahil, Terence and Sanchita, who were all so helpful.) The location was also a plus, as we could walk to the Globe Theater, many restaurants, and along the Thames.
We plan to stay there again on our next visit to London.",5,2023,09,20
120,Recommendations for a quality stay,"Services for Diamond members
　Excellent lounge and beverage service throughout the day.
　Room upgrades were difficult due to overcrowding

Contactless check-in via app and full use of digital keys (many Hilton chains don't do this very well)

Convenient access to Southwark station and bus stations
Rooms are best in class in terms of cleanliness, taste and space

Excellent breakfast restaurant

Thank you to all the staff, we will be back next time!",4,2023,09,20
120,Drilling noise non stop,"The hotel itself is ok. 
As a Diamond member we received a room with no vie, there is a film on our window so we can not see out of window at all. 
I am guessing because of the construction. 
The drilling noise starts in the morning and lays all day.
The hotel did not warn us about any construction while booking or when we checked in. 
We would have not stayed here if someone told us there would be drilling noise all day long.",1,2023,09,19
120,Brilliant stay,"We have stayed for a night at Hilton Bankside, it was  amazing experience. The room was spacious and clean. Staff was very welcoming. Location was fantastic! We also had a dinner at the Bar.  Special thanks to Ashok for his incredible service!",5,2023,09,17
120,A great hotel for a business traveller,"Been staying here every few months or so on business and occasionally family trips since it opened in 2015.  Modern design, great team, good facilities, and a lot more character than most modern hotels. Rooms are decent size and well fitted out, gym / pool quite good for London, bar not at all cookie cutter and overall retains a ‘boutique’ish’ feel",5,2023,09,16
120,A Jewel In Hiltons Crown,"This 5star Hotel is located at the north end of Great Suffolk Street close to the Tate modern.
The closest underground stations are Southwark and Borough about 8 and 10 minutes' walk away respectively.

The hotel has everything you would expect from a 5 star property; it has full facilities gym, swimming pool, restaurants etc. 
As a diamond member I received a room upgrade to an executive room which was well appointed and fully equipped. The special touches like luxury toiletries, bath robes, slippers etc., complementary soft drinks and snacks all of which make you feel very much at home and a valued guest. 

Breakfast is full buffet which is excellent and of the highest calibre, with a chef on duty to prepare eggs etc. Lunch, Dinner, and afternoon tea are also available. The executive lounge is open throughout the day for coffee, tea, soft drinks, snacks, and for the evening social with canapés and alcoholic drinks.

The staff at this hotel certainly go the extra mile, it seems nothing is too much trouble for them; they do everything to make guests welcome, and comfortable, whilst keeping them safe.

My stay on this occasion was for business, reception was incredibly helpful, and made sure everything ran smoothly for me.

I can highly recommend this hotel for both business and leisure.

There is a small gym and an indoor swimming pool and is conveniently located opposite the Tate modern with easy access to Borough Market, Southbank and Waterloo. I highly recommend this hotel.",5,2023,09,14

120,London's best hotel,This is a well located hotel on the wonderful South Bank.  Its facilities are excellent and staff are very helpful and professional at all times.  We could not have been looked after better.  Strongly recommended at any time of the year.,5,2023,09,12
120,Service with kindness is something I will remember.,"I have stayed at the Hilton London Bankside many times over the years for business and pleasure trips. The location on the South Bank of the River Thames is excellent, and the neighborhood is very walkable, with a wide choice of bars, coffee shops, and restaurants. 

This review is because I want to note that the staff was intent on creating a terrific customer experience. There was a minor issue with my room on checking. Sam and Park at the front desk prioritized resolving the problem and were very gracious in the service they offered. Thank you.

Also, the breakfast team is fantastic even when busy. Ali on the egg station always makes me feel incredibly welcome and remembers exactly how I love my breakfast. He always asks about my family and sends greetings to my mother. You don't expect that kind of kindness in a central London hotel; he reflects the high quality of the people in the Hilton Bankside team.

Thanks also for the lovely underground gym and pool. I was especially delighted to use the Peloton bike to burn off my excesses.

Thank you for making my home-from-home in London an effortless choice.

120,Great stay at a modern hotel with excellent service,"Hilton Diamond Member, 1 award and 1 paid stay a few days apart (mixing up work with leisure).

Chuffed to find a Hilton in London with a pool (the other one with the Finance First gym underneath doesn't count), this was my first encounter with this property.  Excellent from start to finish.

Most notable feature (besides the pool and reliable air conditioning, very important this week in London) was the service.  Staff were consistently on their game and service was both friendly and efficient - room service, housekeeping, reception, all very good.

Great modern rooms with decent water pressure in the shower, very quiet at night and did I mention the pool and air conditioning?

Decent Exec Lounge, breakfast was great but the dinner menu (restaurant and room service) was pretty limited in menu range, very easy to find alternative options elsewhere.  

Sainsbury's local literally next door, Tesco across the street.  Gail's Bakery nearby is a great spot for tea and cake.

Will definitely return.",5,2023,09,09
120,Weekend trip,Very nice hotel spotless room and beds very comfortable. Executive lounge was very good and the restaurant food was excellent. All staff were very friendly welcoming except the front of desk team leader. Unfortunately we felt she didn’t really want to help hotel guests or even try. She never once smiled and  was very unwelcoming. On 3 occasions we went with a query and she said she couldn’t help us yet when we asked another member of the front desk they were very happy to help. Such a shame that she let the team down as everyone else couldn’t be anymore friendly and helpful. ,4,2023,09,09

Everything was so nice, very organized hotel, efficient housekeeping, clean, the location was great, easy walk to so many restaurants & coffee shops & Tate museum.

We definitely would like to stay at Bankside again in the  future!",5,2023,09,06
120,Wonderful Hilton Bankside Hotel and Executive Lounge,"The Hilton London Bankside is truly a wonderful 5* hotel. The check-in staff were very efficient, as Hilton Diamond members we were upgraded to a one bedroom suite which was amazing. Yen and Terence in the Executive Lounge were both a credit to Hilton. They were both very attentive and friendly, Yen looked after me making my Gin & Bitter Lemon! The food in the Executive Lounge was excellent. Overall it was the most enjoyable experience of any Hilton Hotel that we have stayed at, we would not hesitate to return.",5,2023,09,06

Really enjoyed the breakfast and amnesties (swimming pool, gym, kids play area).

",5,2023,09,02
120,Another excellent stay,I’m a regular visitor to Bankside with my 16 year old daughter since the hotel opened. My sister and 7 year old niece joined us on this visit. The hotel emailed me before arrival asking who would be staying and did we have any requests. I explained it would be my niece’s first visit to London and I wanted to make it extra special and it certainly was. A goody bag in her room was the first amazing treat for her but she was also so excited at the child’s robe and slippers. All of the staff are always so friendly and would do anything to help. Kamaal stood out for us this visit. He helped my niece with the fox trail in the hotel and told her next time he’ll help her find even more. These are all small things but they add up to making this our favourite hotel in London,5,2023,08,31
120,"Shoddy customer service, extremely loud plumbing, and they don’t honour Hilton Honors Gold benefits!","While the location is good, and the hotel is nice, (we stayed here last year) the customer service is shoddy to say the least.

One issue was, whenever we turned on the hot water in our room, whether that be the tap, or shower, there was a very loud fog horn sound coming from the plumbing. For such a prestigious hotel brand, this is sloppy to say the least, and woke up my partner when using the bathroom at 2am. You come away to hotels for a relaxing break, not to be woken at this hour.

We booked through Booking.com as it was much cheaper than booking direct.
When checking in, we gave our Hilton Honors Membership Number to the person checking us in, to which the lady said “Thanks for being a valued Gold Member” and put out room key into the “We’re honoured to have you as a Gold Member” card sleeve.

Inside of this card sleeve (see the attached photos) it states “Enjoy these perks as a Gold Member: Complimentary Continental Breakfast”

Our second issue occurred when we enquired about our breakfast moments ago and the guy on reception said that because we booked through Booking.com, that we wouldn’t get this breakfast, even as a Gold Member.

This meant having to rush out of the hotel to find breakfast elsewhere instead of enjoying our time in the hotel, after spending very good money to stay here.

1. Why give us a card sleeve that states we would get these benefits?
2. What is the point in thanking me for being a Gold Member if you won’t honour what my Gold Level Membership gets?
3. Where is the value in the Gold Membership if it isn’t “honoured”?

Really poor customer service, and it has left a very sour taste in our mouthes. As if as a Gold Member, this breakfast can’t be honoured. We’ll certainly try to avoid Hilton in the future after this poor experience of both poor customer service, and fog horn plumbing!",1,2023,08,29
120,Hilton London Bankside,"Hotel room, facilities & location was 5/5

Morning Cocktails from bloody mary's & evening drinks were top draw! 5/5

120,Excellent choice! Our family of six loved it. ,"There’s a lot of hotel choices in London, but if I were traveling there again with my family of six, I’d go back to Hilton Bankside. The staff and attention to detail were top notch. Zana on the breakfast staff, Ali taking care of all the amazing breakfast options, Kamaal who helped us with our departure and the other porter (whose name I forget!) who helped us with our baggage when we arrived early, just a few examples of many who made our stay excellent. 

The breakfast buffet was an incredible start to our many full days of sightseeing, and the rooms were perfectly clean and comfortable. Even a few evening surprises in our rooms on a few nights!

Thanks so much for taking care of my family and making our stay outstanding! ",5,2023,08,24

120,A picky 4 closer to a 4.5 score,"A lovely welcome for our family stay. A sweet cart that the kids could help themselves too (thank you!) and an introduction to a hotel  treasure hunt which my youngest loved (find the foxes across the hotel for a prize … which weirdly was a coffee cup. Such a great idea to then finish with a coffee cup for a kid is just odd - not to be ungrateful but …)

We had a king/twin interconnecting room which is mainly why we chose this hotel + the pool. The rooms are nicely down, well laid out and comfortable beds / strong showers. 

Breakfast in OXBO was very good. The buffet was constantly restocked and the restaurant well laid out so it didn’t feel busy even though it was 

Dinner in the distillery bar was a bit odd. One server was great and the rest mixed. We ordered steak for my child and askedfor pasta instead of fries … the response “chef says we need to charge you more” really? I said no and it caused quite the discussion with the managers?!  She got her pasta. All was fine 

The pool has a nice vibe quite cold but the setting warm and good for lengths 

Overall a good stay and we would come again",4,2023,08,20
120,5 Stars,The hotel is so nice and the staff is even nicer. Keya helped us check in and always made sure we had everything we needed throughout the trip. The Distillery bar connected to the hotel is an amazing experience that you must check out while you’re there.  ,5,2023,08,19
120,A 5 star experience !!,"All the staff starting with Raoul the Manager to John at the concierge and everyone we came across at the reception, breakfast (waffle bar, omelette bar, service staff and others) and house keeping were extremely attentive to our needs. No request to big and super kind!!! We felt welcomed and treated with such warmth.

The location of the hotel and room cleanliness and size are great!

Will come again and highly recommend the hotel to everyone!",5,2023,08,18
120,"Lovely hotel, superb staff","I had an evening event in London and turned up really early and asked if there was a cafe nearby where I could work.  Ewelina at reception was extremely helpful and not only found me somewhere to work from within the hotel but arranged for my room to be ready really early and kept me up to date.  I was really pleasantly surprised about how well treated I felt in a big London hotel on a Friday.  

The hotel was very pleasant and my room was very nice, with good USB and power sockets, and a good shower.  The breakfast buffet was lovely.

Really nice to feel like an individual at such a large city hotel and the staff were just wonderful. ",5,2023,08,17
120,Fantastic customer service,"We had a wonderful time and the customer service was fantastic! Zein and Chef Ali in Oxbo, John and Kamaal at the Concierge desk, Daniel and Joseph out front and Amira at the front desk were all incredible and we really appreciate how well they took care of us during our stay.",5,2023,08,17
120,Absolutely love this hotel,"This is the second year that I have staid at this particular Hilton. They are very welcoming and incredibly helpful. The bar and restaurant food is wonderful. I had some of the front workers recognize me and cam and gave me a personal welcome back. The lady that cleaned my room did a great job and on my last night she told me she was going to miss me. The employees in general were incredible l if I get back to London next year I will stay here again. 

I highly recommend it. It is in walking distance to so many of the sights.",5,2023,08,17
120,Best hotel in London!,"We will never stay anywhere else when visiting London.  The family rooms were amazing: two adjoining rooms, each with their own bathroom which was a huge plus for all of our early mornings.  Our room had a king bed and the other room had two twins for two of our daughters.  There were 10 of us all together and we all loved it.  The beds were so comfortable.  The breakfast was included and high quality with many choices.  Every staff member we interacted with was lovely and very helpful.  The cost was not cheap, as London is an expensive city.  But it was actually less expensive with much greater quality than other places we have stayed on past trips to London.  It is a 10 min walk to a tube station that will take you to most locations.  We enjoyed being close to the Thames river and the exciting area around the National Theater.  There are shops, restaurants and a big food market minutes from the hotel.  We could not have been happier with our stay.  ",5,2023,08,16
120,Great stay ,We had a fantastic stay at Hilton Bankside in August. The team in the executive lounge are very attentive especially Yen. The whole team looked after us so well and made our stay very special. We will definitely be back.,5,2023,08,16
120,Brilliant hotel great stay!,"Great option for families, spacious rooms and friendly service, Particularly from Sahil, Yen in the lounge and Kemal in concierg , breakfast was great - Zuzana making sure check in was smooth and requests met, overall I’m pleased to have stayed here this is my new spot for London.",5,2023,08,14
120,Great option,Great location and services.  Rooms are spacious and new.  Yen and Sahil in the executive lounge were awesome with their services especially with young kids.  Would highly recommend staying here as it is pretty close to an Underground for going around town,5,2023,08,13
120,Five star personal service,"The service at this hotel is excellent. I needed an extra blanket for our bed at 10:30 at night. Within a few minutes one was delivered to our room. 
     Also, the black sesame crackers in the Hilton perks area are DELICIOUS; I wanted to know if they were available for purchase on line from a supplier. We were checking out when I inquired about them.  Samuel Seton at the front desk took down my email with the promise to investigate for me. Within hours he had responded. Unfortunately, they are bought in bulk and are not available. Samuel said the solution was to come back for another fill. Ha, he is not wrong. 
     Additionally, it is a beautiful hotel. Well-designed rooms with small delightful fox touches found in unexpected places. Foxes are a subtle, but whimsical theme of the hotel. ",4,2023,08,11
120,Double charging and uncomfortable beds,"
I just completed a 7 night stay at the Hilton Bankside London. It was my third stay.  Unfortunately, on this occasion I am very disappointed with the services and how I was treated.

On arrival, a holding amount was applied to my credit card for my 7 night stay plus a £200 deposit for any possible expenses such as room service. I was told that the total charge would be pending until I checked out, however this transaction was released and the hotel did another transaction to the same amount which was immediately debited from my credit card. This temporarily impacted the available funds on my credit card as the released amount took 6 days to be dropped. I was then informed by the duty manager that the total amount charged by the person who checked me in was in error and that she had processed a refund of the £200 deposit. This is yet to be reflected on my credit card account and the hotel staff are unable to produce accounting documentation that clearly reflects the credit and debit transactions. These careless charges by staff and appalling accounting documentation are totally unacceptable! 

I am also extremely shocked to find out that I have been charged for a service fee plus a tray fee as an addition to the £22 beef burger that I ordered as room service. It’s upsetting to see these hidden charges. Surely the hotel is obligated to disclose them to guests!

On my previous stays, I had no issues with the beds, however this time I have found the mattresses to be extremely hard and uncomfortable. I inspected three different rooms of the hotel and all of them were uncomfortable. The reception staff and duty manager showed zero empathy towards me, so I had to just put up with being uncomfortable during my entire stay.

I really expected more from a Hilton hotel, especially since I was a returning guest who's provided good reviews in the past aned have recommended the hotel to many of my friends and family. 

I will not be returning to the Hilton Bankside London.",1,2023,08,10
120,Unexpected and disappointed stay,"The hotel has a good infrastructure of facilities but the quality of service did not meet a 5-star hotel.  I was confirmed a room online but was given a lower grade of room without prior notice.  Most of staff (receptionist, waitress and entrance guard) were not friendly. For the cocktail in the lounge (6-8 pm), I reached it at 7:53 pm. The man removed all dishes and drinks at 8 pm sharp though I was still getting the food. I told him about the late arrival but useless. Is it necessary to remove all the food promptly? For the morning breakfast, the waitress collected by plate and the juice remains were spilled into my trousers. She ran away without caring of my complaint. ",3,2023,08,09
120,Pool made this an A+ stay,"I stayed at the hotel for 2 nights and booked the hotel based on it having a pool. It did not disappoint.  
The bed was comfortable, the black out drapes kept it nice and dark for late sleep in.  The room was quiet and no noticeable noise from hallway/other rooms.  The robe and slippers were great to slip into after showering.  
The pool / locker room / toilet & shower rooms were clean/neat. The locker room had plenty of lockers with PIN code locks for storage. One of the locks didn’t work, but there was plenty of other available lockers to chose from that did.  Toilets / showers in connected room through locker room made it convenient to shower before/ after getting in the pool.  There was also a swim suit dryer that I was pleasantly surprised to see and happy to not travel with a wet suit.   
My only issues was my room didn’t have much of a view (looking to interior of building and while the outlet had usb outlets, it would be nice to update to include lightening charger outlets. I also stubbed my toe while opening the closet doors",5,2023,08,08
120,Very comfortable hotel in a great location..,"Enjoyable stay at the Hilton London Bankside, staff were helpful and friendly. 
Our room was on the 3rd floor,  room 342 a comfortable Kingsize room which was very modern and had great facilities, tea, coffee, large TV, very good shower with nice toiletries! 
Only negative is we had to keep the curtains drawn due to the rooms close proximity to rooms opposite, not the most private room I’ve ever stayed in! 
We slept very well and enjoyed the buffet breakfast at £20 each, there was plenty of choice and we didn’t have to wait for anything to be replenished, it did get busy around 10am on the Sunday morning. 
I would definitely stay at the Hilton again. 
The hotel is in a great location with easy access to the River, South bank and Borough Market with it’s many restaurants and street food locations, we called at Flat Iron square which was okay for a quick meal and drink, but a little pricey! 
",5,2023,08,08
120,Treated like royalty ,"Sanchita, Terence and Yen provided stellar service to us in the executive lounge with attentive care making sure everyone was taken care of, the food was fully stocked and gave a personalised service. From the many lounges I've been in this was by far a stand out experience. ",5,2023,08,08
120,A perfect way to end a very busy day,"Superb customer service in the Executive Lounge this evening, Very attentive team on duty, with a great focus on ensuring that customers were having a true executive experience.

A special mention to Yen, Terrence and Sanchita for being very attentive and tuned in to each table’s progress, a very professional service. 

Thank you team.",5,2023,08,08
120,"The services from Yen, Sanchita, and Terrence were outstanding.  Nice drink selection and the food was good.",Very pleasant atmosphere and good food and drink selections.  Service was extremely attentive and efficient.  Extended hours made visiting very convenient and relaxing.  Yen was particularly helpful.  Four different juices and coffee selections.,5,2023,08,08
120,Fantastic Experience ,"One of the best hotels I have stayed in. Beautifully located and prefect for moving around near the lovely monumental attractions around River Thames area. The staff are excellent and very friendly and caring, and I would like to commend afew individuals - John, Steve, Nalan, Joseph, Mairaj and of course,Raul Desouza",5,2023,08,08
120,Very pleased with our stay!,"We stayed at the Hilton London Bankside in July 2023, as a family of 4 (two adults, 2 pre-teen/teenage kids).

We had a lovely stay at the Hilton Bankside in London.  The hotel is modern, clean, well-maintained, with recently renovated rooms.  The staff was all very helpful and provided excellent service with any questions or issues we had.  The only thing we were a bit let down on was the food; we were hoping to have dinner at the restaurant, though it was closed on the evening in question (only 'bar food' available at the bar, which was open).  And the breakfast buffet selection and service was not as good as we had expected.  

The location is okay; it's 1 block from the Tate Modern, about a 7-10 minute walk to the nearest underground stop (Southwark), and a 20 minute walk to Waterloo Station.  Be aware that in the evenings there's not much open in the neighbourhood; it seems to be mostly a business district, so the restaurants close early.  There were 3 grocery shops within a 1-2 block radius, so easy to get drinks/snacks if needed!

TLDR:  Great hotel, excellent service, though the location doesn't offer much in the way of nightlife or restaurants.",4,2023,08,07
120,"By far, the best experience our family has had","This experience is rooted and nurtured in a culture of genuine care, attention to detail, and thoughtful, personable service. James, Raul and John along with their teams are first class and went out of their way to connect with us, and in particular, our children. I would highly recommend the Hilton Bankside, be sure to ask Raul for a tour of the kitchen. Its impressive and spotless!",5,2023,08,07
120,Very Enjoyable Stay,"Hilton London Bankside offers very comfortable accommodations in a bustling and vibrant part of London (South Bank/Borough Market) with good access to public transportation and minutes away from several major attractions. Staff at reception and in the restaurant are very pleasant and work hard to make your stay enjoyable. Our room was spacious and quiet and in excellent condition. The contemporary design is very attractive, but the room would benefit from a bit more lighting. The breakfast buffet is excellent; a very large variety of foods available and nicely presented. 
Would not hesitate to stay here again!",5,2023,08,06
120,Second Great Stay at the Hilton London Bankside,"This was our second stay at the Hilton London Bankside; the first was five years prior. Ten of us were staying in four rooms on a family holiday. The hotel is in a great location with smart styling; the executive lounge is very nice; rooms and common areas were clean and tidy; and staff were warm and helpful. In particular, Marcia, Sanchita and Younis who worked in the executive lounge went above and beyond with friendly and attentive service. My Diamond status was recognized, and I received an upgrade to a better suite. I wouldn't hesitate to stay at this hotel again when back in London!",5,2023,08,05
120,Top Notch Hotel. Excellent Service. Daniel rocks!,"Stayed at Hilton Bankside for 1 night in London. Hotel location is great, rooms are fantastic and service is top notch. Daniel the doorman was very attentive ever since we walked in to the hotel and he also assisted us with directions and restaurant recommendations. We were able to get early check in which was amazing. I’ll definitely be back to Hilton Bankside in London!",5,2023,08,04
120,"Right in the heart of London, but so friendly","Wanting to keep it short. Fantastic location in London, modern Hilton, clean and tidy. Great amenities. Like being able to jump in a great pool after having walked for 10+ miles visiting along the River. 
But most importantly, such friendly people and service. With special thanks to Sahil and Terence who have been serving us in the exec lounge in the most friendly way. They kept our plates with great finger food  and glasses with bubbles full. 
Great hotel, in a great location in the greatest city.",4,2023,08,04
120,The best hotel in City -  Hilton London Bankside,Prompt & Friendly welcoming. Nicely deigned with a class and comfortable  room. We had a great sleep and a great breakfast in the morning as well. The hotel location is excellent for a night out and a morning walk too. ,5,2023,08,04
120,Front desk double charged me and I had to fix it myself,"The hotel was new, clean, and comfortable. The staff were friendly but the front desk requires more training.

When I checked in that morning, I showed my prepaid voucher from my British Airways package. The receptionist asked for my credit card for a £50 deposit. To my surprise, this was a gross misrepresentation because I got a notification afterwards from my bank that I had been charged £770. Only when I asked did she tell me that I was charged (again) for the whole stay instead of a deposit.

When I showed her my package again, which was titled in large letters “Prepaid Voucher”, she somehow couldn’t understand the meaning of “prepaid” and told me that the document didn’t mention anything about me having paid in advance.

Multiple front desk staff told me they’d have to ask BA to see the money had gone, but had no clue when they would get an answer.

I called the front desk in the evening to ask how much it would cost me to make a local call from my room to BA myself to figure it out. They had no idea what local calls would be charged and transferred me to the finance department, to both my and the finance department’s surprise. The finance department told me to ask the front desk.

Anyways, since I had a hold of them, the lovely finance person helped me look into their system and saw straight away that I had been double charged for the room. The money had been sent to Hilton ages ago. The issue was settled within minutes, with no credit to the front desk.

If only they had called their own colleagues to check their own system instead of saying Hilton couldn’t locate my money!",4,2023,08,04
120,High Standard Hotel,Always welcoming I have been staying here for years and I find this the best Hilton in the country. The concierge service is always first class and the breakfast service is always a joy especially Ali in the kitchen. Rooms are very good when I have been allocated to a 1 bed suite some rooms do lack natural light.,5,2023,08,01
120,Our first time in London,"The service was so amazing that it is difficult to put into words.  From the moment we were dropped off by the taxi, the five star service began.  We were met by Daniel who gathered our bags and had a glass of Prosecco each for my husband and me.  He then escorted our two boys over to the candy tray for goodies.  We had a family room (two adjoining rooms) which was well appointed and modernly designed/decorated.  Every staff member we encountered was lovely.  
My husband went to the bar almost every night and raved about one bartender in particular, Juan David.  I went to the bar with him the last few nights and saw why he raved about Juan David so much.  The service he provided was great as well as his drink recommendations.  This was our first time in London and he also recommend places around London for us to visit.  Hilton, Juan David is certainly a gem!!  
The OXBO restaurant within the hotel was very good.  It exceeded my expectations as hotel restaurants are usually okay at best, in my opinion.  The food was really good and the prices reasonable.  We went two nights in a row.  My family enjoyed their meal so much the first visit that they ordered the exact same dish the every next day.  Our waitress was fabulous but unfortunately, I do not remember her name.  She was a tall young lady and waited on us both times.  Less than halfway through our stay, we decided the next time we visit London, we will defiantly make the Hilton London Southbank our hotel of choice.",5,2023,07,29
120,A lovely hotel in a great location,"This hotel is fabulous. The staff were friendly, professional and provided outstanding service. The rooms were immaculate, we had interconnecting rooms as a family with teens and it’s was perfect. The facilities were second to one as well. Great location too. Tube an easy 5 minutes walk.",5,2023,07,28
120,Bad Experience,"Very poor front desk with the most unfriendly attitude by Unni menon. It was just a bad start for our stay. 
We were given accessible rooms which were not requested and it’s not in our reservation details. And when we asked to be changed they promised to change the rooms but this didn’t happen!!! Just terrible!!!
Breakfast was not good enough",2,2023,07,28
120,executive lounge service,"lovely service in the executive lounge, especially by Sanchita and Younis. absolutely lovely ladies, they complimented my nails :) and when dinner service was ending they gave me an extra glass of champagne",5,2023,07,26
120,Bankside Hilton,"The hotel staff were very efficient, polite and provided outstanding customer service.  Two of the clergy men Kamaal and Daniel went above and beyond to ensure customer satisfaction! I will definitely visit again!",5,2023,07,26
120,"Great hotel, positive reviews rightly justified","I went to this hotel following several positive reviews. I wasn’t disappointed. Rooms are clean, bedding is top class and staff is extremely friendly. Room size is decent for London and the pool is an added plus. 

What I didn’t like is the room service where it felt like they were too aggressive on their tray charge and service fees. I did try to challenge this as it appeared to be way outside the norm. 

Overall, we had a great time and will be visiting again ",5,2023,07,26
120,Family return visit...,"I always choose this hotel when in London for both family and business stays.  It is a very well managed hotel (credit to James & Kim) and I feel it has more of a luxury boutique 'feel' than that of a typical generic Hilton hotel.  The staff are excellent and I would like to give a special shout out and thank you to the Executive Lounge staff (Rhys, Sanchita & Yen) who looked after myself and my family during our visit.  Very attentive and friendly and we look forward to seeing them again later this fall.  Thank you all!",5,2023,07,25
120,Lovely hotel and staff,"We’ve stayed at this hotel so often and we love it so much! The only downside is that our room didn’t have its own shower, only over the bath - but this hasn’t happened before.
The staff are really friendly. Particularly Kamack, a great Porter - always greets you with a smile and super helpful. Thank you!",4,2023,07,25
120,Summer visit at the Hilton Bankside,"We really enjoyed our stay at the Hilton Bankside. It’s very centrally located and is within walking distance to many restaurants and markets. The room we had was comfortable and spacious. The bed was a dream. 
Best part of the stay was the helpful and friendly staff with one standout being Kamaal at the concierge. He was always ready to assist and give great recommendations. We also really loved the weekend buffet and the cocktail menu in the lounge. 
Hands down at 5 out of 5 stay.",5,2023,07,24
120,Daniel the door man 👨 ,"Daniel the Doorman he is so helpful super friendly he has amazing super positive energy . This guy is a Diamond 💎 he definitely need a pay rise for his amazing service haha.  We have really enjoyed the stay and the hotel is top tier amazing service all around 👏 

Kamila ",5,2023,07,24
120,Always a pleasure,"
We stayed for 3 nights first part of Easter and loved every second of our stay. Hilton Bankside is our favorite hotel in London by far and we have stayed several times before.
This time we got a very appreciated upgrade to a suite and even if the normal rooms are great this was an absolute heaven.  My husband is a Hilton Diamond Member so that gives us some extra benefits.
 
Breakfast has a huge selection and the drinks in the Executive Lounge in the early evening is nice too.
Thank you to all staff for looking so well after us and we will be back soon",5,2023,07,24
120,Hilton people,"Abi baby was so lovely and despite being a busy breakfast area with many customers coming and going had on our second day remembered that I needed gluten free toast and just sorted it.  
Kamaal concierge also made us feel really welcome.  
Great people - wonderful weekend.",5,2023,07,24
120,Family visit to London,"Great area of London to stay in.  This Hilton is modern and clean. Staff was incredibly helpful.  Very impressed overall and we are very picky.  At the bar, Juan David introduce us to two new gins we had never had before.   Would we come back and stay here?  Absolutely.",5,2023,07,22
120,Great stay in the Hilton Bankside,"The stay was great, nice hotel and we were well looked after by Yen and Sanchita at the executive lounge. They made sure we were at ease there. They were smiley, welcoming and their service was top notch. ",5,2023,07,22
120,"Great Hotel, Great Location","Our stay was great. The hotel was wonderful and on check in we were offered an upgrade. We were well looked after by Yen & Sanchita in the Executive  Lounge, they always kept our glasses topped up. Would recommend a stay ",5,2023,07,22
120,Great time in London,This hotel is great for families. We got the Family Room and it was perfect. It made our stay so comfortable. The pool was a great escape for our kids after a busy day of sightseeing. Breakfast was great. Something healthy for everyone. Kamaal at the concierge desk made getting a taxi easy and even helped with the luggage. Thanks for a great trip!,5,2023,07,21
120,Awesome service and great hotel,"Our stay was great! When we entered the room, the hotel staff had prepared a very nice welcome package for my daughters, even with custom-size slippers and bathrobes, making us feel really welcomed! 
The rooms were very nice and clean. Modern style, good illumination (usually a big gap in mostly all chain-hotels), and all
The employees were very kind to us. Perfect stay!",5,2023,07,21
120,Corporate Event,"Excellent service in arranging a business/corporate event.  The staff were responsive and flexible at all times.  The facilities and catering of a high standard.  The location is also excellent and good value for money.

Would definitely use again.",5,2023,07,20
120,Great Experience,"We stayed at this hotel for 6 nights for the 2nd part of our trip to London. Conrad St James, where we stayed at the beginning of the trip, had set the bar pretty high, but Hilton followed with flying colors. As Hilton Diamond members, we were upgraded to a 1 bedroom corner suite with the view of the Shard in the distance, which was a really great start. 
We were very pleasantly surprised to find that their Executive Lounge is really outstanding ((we did not expect much after the disappointing executive lounge at Conrad)). Hilton's lounge had excellent, plentiful and tasty hot and cold appetizers, cookies, pastries, wine, beer and.. what a surprise - my favorite passion fruit juice! The setting of their executive lounge is great, chairs and sofas are comfy. Big thumbs up to the manager of this lounge! Probably the best executive lounge experience so far for us.  
On the other hand, their breakfast buffet was disappointing for us, we expected much better (especially after a great breakfast buffet at Conrad); but it did still have made to order omelets. 
The location of the hotel is very good. It is not as close to the tube station as the Conrad, but still within a 7-min walking distance, which we found extremely important if you are actively exploring all different parts of the city and beyond.
This was our first visit to London and will not be last. London has definitely exceeded our expectations and amazed us in so many ways. We truly enjoyed our visit. ",5,2023,07,19
120,Perfect location close to Tate Modern and the Globe,"Looked like a standard business type hotel from the outside, but the staff was really friendly and helpful, especially in the Executive Lounge. Abi Baby served us a lot and was outstanding, but the team was all exceptionally good in there and it was a pleasure to use. The standard business hotel image was shattered when we walked into our Penthouse Suite! Colourful, quirky and full of objets d'art, it was a real treat. The huge balcony made it hard to leave the room at times, and the all marble bathroom was roomy and felt special.  It was maybe five minutes (if that) walk to the south bank of the Thames, just behind Tate Modern and the Globe. We felt the hotel was really well run and we would definitley like to return. Recommended.  ",5,2023,07,18
120,Fab bottomless brunch!!,"Had the most amazing bottomless brunch with a few friends, this included 4 courses & 2 hours of bubbles!! The service was so good, our glasses were constantly being filled by Patrick & Claudia, would definitely recommend & will definitely be returning!!  Great surrounding & buzzing atmosphere too",5,2023,07,17
120,Hilton Bankside: A Must Stay,"We are here for five nights! The customer service is over the top and excels in the Executive Lounge. The first night, my husband celebrated a birthday and a large staff came out and sang happy birthday and presented him with a cake. The servers Terence, Sahil and Rhys were phenomenal. 

Earlier before we checked in for our stay, there was a glitch with our reservation. Hilton fixed it and we were upgraded to a one-bedroom suite. The housekeeping is immaculate and perfectly arranged in the suite. 

Any trip to London must include a stay at the Hilton Bankside.",5,2023,07,15
120,A lovely dinner.,"We dined in the restaurant and enjoyed a delicious two course dinner. I chose a salad starter with the chicken main. My wife chose the same main and the crème brûlée for dessert. Marcia’s table service was outstanding. She was courteous, welcoming and helpful. We thoroughly recommend this as a fine dining experience. Michael K",5,2023,07,12
120,Modern and new I’m the middle of the fun ,"Such a nice new hotel in the center of all the fun with super comfy beds.

The absolute best concierge service with Kamaal 

This hotel is within 5 minutes of walking to the river for a dinner with a view.  Close bus stops and tube access. ",5,2023,07,11
120,Edina Farkas Review- Important,"Amazing Hotel, Very professional staff. Distillery Bar is the best. I am a regular guest there. Anne is an amazing supervisor. Beqa is the best at making cocktails. Ladies, if you want to have amazing cocktails, please ask him to do it, very sweet bartender.",5,2023,07,11
120,Perfect stay for our family,We had an amazing stay at the Hilton Bankside.  The staff was so warm and personable and made our stay very memorable.  The location was very convenient with easy access to the tube and walking distance to the borrow market and other local restaurants.  We got connecting rooms for the family.  It was perfect and the Hilton team went out of the way to make everyone feel special including cute plush foxes in the room and fun games for the kids to play.  Joseph was especially attentive to all of our needs and made sure we got around London with ease.  I would definitely recommend staying here and hope to be back again soon.  Thanks so much for everything!,5,2023,07,08
120,Stay was lovely!,"They set out slippers, breakfast was lovely, the pool was nice... what I'd expect from this hotel. While we waited for our cab one of the concierge (Kamaal maybe?) brought my fussy toddler a fox stuffy to keep! She loves it! Above and beyond. Thank you.",5,2023,07,07
120,Thumbs up!!!,"Great service!!! On-time, clean, professional and friendly. Booked months in advance and the reservation did not skip a beat.  Got a text 30 mins before pickup with drivers name and number and 10 mins before pickup he was waiting down stairs in the hotel lobby.  Thanks again.",5,2023,07,07
120,Great Team,"Special thank you to Soe Ko and Phillip who work at Hilton Bankside that made the large conference event I attend there very enjoyable, catering for my dietary needs. Appreciate the care and efforts you made. ",5,2023,07,06
120,Best by far.,"As a regular guest at the Hilton Bankside I have come to expect the highest quality customer service as standard - staff are warm and welcoming, rooms are great and breakfast is superb. I rarely write TA reviews but after many nights here I would recommend without reservation and if you are lucky enough to be assisted by the following staff you will never consider another London hotel!

John and Kamal - awesome concierges, nothing too much.
Daniel - greets every guest with a warm welcome.
Sam and Ewelina - this is how check-in should feel at every hotel.
Yen - makes you want to visit the exec lounge, polite and makes you feel at home.
Ali -his welcoming smile on the breakfast hot buffet is a great start to any day.

Could  easily list more of the amazing staff at this hotel but I don’t know everyone’s name! I have never had a bad experience here and if you think my enthusiasm is phoney - you obviously haven’t  stayed yourself!

120,Excellent Experience ,"This hotel is TOP notch! The service in the lounge is amazing. Thank you Sanchita, Terence, and Yen. They were amazing in the lounge. Great drinks and food. Thank you! They service went above and beyond in the entire hotel. ",5,2023,07,05
120,Overall Great Experience ,"We recently stayed in the family joining rooms and had an excellent time!  This is our second stay here and it did not disappoint.  We had a very friendly welcome and Kamaal was a fabulous concierge and took very good care of us as well.  The room was spacious, modern and clean.  The hotel location is good and several little grocery places are very close to the hotel.  Breakfast was good and the executive lounge was very nice as well.  We did not try the bar so I cannot comment on that.  Only semi negative I have is at check out, the young lady seemed like I was bothering her a bit, but hey, maybe she was having a bad day?  I would highly recommend this hotel and will return on our next visit.",5,2023,07,04
120,Excellent service from the executive lounge team once again,"When we visit London for work or fun it’s here we stay most times with it’s handy location, lovely staff, great size rooms(for london).  Yet again the executive lounge team have been 
 outstanding. Service, food and drinks excellent with a special shout out for Sanchita. Thank you",5,2023,07,04
120,Fantastic to be home from home,"Back to my favourite hotel in London- haven’t been here for a few months but as soon as I walked into the executive lounge, Yen xvong Ly was straight over and remembered my name, my drink and my best mates name who would arrive the following day. Always a pleasure and great to see Yen again who is always attentive and is the best at customer service!",5,2023,07,03
120,A big thank you!,"We’ve had a wonderful time at the Hilton so far. Thank you to the kitchen staff - Swapnil ,   in the Executive lounge for providing fresh soft bread for my little girl for her little loose tooth and Ali,  at breakfast who fresh boiled eggs for us as we struggled through some serious jet lag. These small gestures made a huge difference. Much appreciated! ",5,2023,07,03
120,Lovely hotel ,"Lovely hotel. Very friendly staff. Room was very quiet and comfortable. Everything was perfect. We had breakfast there and it was very nice , buffet style. Everything was really hot and lovely quality. Would definitely recommend.",5,2023,07,01
120,Great hotel and Daniel is a gentleman,This is a great hotel. It is centrally located. Rooms are modern and clean. Daniel the doorman is a great ambassador. He was always ready to help and made our stay even more enjoyable.  Keep up good work! The other staff were also great. The restaurant on premises is very good if you don’t want to venture far.,5,2023,06,30
120,Fantastic experience! ,Wonderful hotel in a central location. Tate modern and borough market just a few steps away. The service at breakfast was also the best- thank you Cecilia for taking such good care of us each morning.  Made me feel right at home with my oat milk latte! ,5,2023,06,30
120,Excellence ! Can’t do better than Bankside,"Excellent stay, having stayed in many 5star that didn’t have the killer combination of great service, rooms, amazing breakfast (hot, tasty American pancakes for us expats who occasionally need a real taste of home) and the full package at the Bankside…what a stay !!! And walking distance to the Tate and the trains, great walking around the area and along the Thames ",5,2023,06,29
120,Hilton London Bankside,"Amazing space to wind down your evening with food and drinks.  Homey space with friendly staff Yen, Sajishma, and Terrance.  They do a great job facilitating and making you feel at home away from home.",5,2023,06,28
120,Unmatched Hospitality at The Executive Lounge - Kudos to Yen!”,"The Executive Lounge is well known for its world-class service and lavish facilities. My recent visit, however, stood out primarily because of one individual – Yen. I am compelled to pen down this review to appreciate and express my gratitude for the exceptional service offered by her.

Right from the get-go, Yen demonstrated an in-depth understanding of professional hospitality. She possesses an uncanny ability to anticipate guests’ needs, an attribute that one might call the quintessence of service excellence. Her welcoming demeanor and her promptness in service delivery consistently left a positive impression on us.

What really distinguished Yen was her exceptional attention to detail. Whether it was keeping our favourite drinks ready without being asked or remembering our breakfast preferences, Yen’s personalised approach made us feel highly valued. She took hospitality to a new level, striking a perfect balance between professionalism and the warmth of personal attention.

Moreover, her knowledge about the facility, local attractions, and her suggestions for places to visit significantly enriched our trip. In all of our interactions, Yen was courteous, patient, and helpful, constantly exceeding our expectations with her dedicated service.

Her capacity to manage multiple tasks efficiently without compromising the quality of service was indeed admirable. Even during peak hours, Yen managed to maintain her calm, exuding a composed aura that was truly reassuring.

Furthermore, Yen’s infectious energy and positive attitude added a unique charm to our experience at the lounge. Her radiant smile and enthusiastic disposition not only elevated the ambiance but also helped create a memorable experience for us.

In conclusion, Yen’s exceptional service at The Executive Lounge greatly enhanced our stay, contributing significantly to our overall trip. Her commitment to providing personalized service is truly a testament to her dedication and passion for her work. Yen is a real asset to the team and undoubtedly deserves recognition. We look forward to visiting again, and hopefully, being pampered by Yen’s unparalleled service once more.

For all those planning a trip, I cannot recommend The Executive Lounge enough, and if you get a chance to meet Yen, rest assured, you’re in the best hands!",5,2023,06,28
120,The service in the lounge was excellent.,"The indoor hotel pool is nice, warm water and area. 

The team in the lounge was very friendly, attentive, and always looking to help. 

We enjoyed the happy hours there. The wine and the deserts were my favorite. 

Thanks Sanchita and Sajishma for your friendly service.",5,2023,06,27
120,"Well located, modern hotel with great facilities and staff","As HH Gold members, my wife and I chose Hilton Bankside for our week’s stay in London as it is close to many landmarks, with easy access to other areas of London itself. (Nearby walkable underground stations are Southwark and Blackfriars). The room was large and comfortable, the breakfast buffet was remarkable, and the surrounding area itself is quite trendy. The staff are very friendly and helpful, and in this regard I must commend Terence and his team in the Executive Lounge. I asked Terence which menu items were gluten free and he went several extra miles to get me a special gluten meal, and to explain what else would have been available for me during the rest of my stay … all without making a fuss. Truly remarkable  customer service that I really appreciated!  ",5,2023,06,26
120,Great Hotel at Bankside London,"Lovely clean accommodation,  staff are always friendly and welcoming. Was offered drink upon arrival. Oxbo staff Dominico always attentive, and always a very warm welcome from Ali Asgar for breakfast, which has a great selection of food and drinks on offer. Stayed here many times and the only hotel we would now consider while staying in London.

120,Not great start but ended well,"My wife and I stayed at Hilton Bankside in December 2022 for close to week.  We were in town for business and chose this location due to being close to office.  Well when we checked in and got to our room, the room did not smell great and bathroom more specifically toilet needed to be cleaned.  There was lack of urgency by front desk to address which was very disappointing.  I finally got to talk with manager and she was very nice.  She got us free dinner at on-site restaurant which helped along with getting us into better room.  The executive lounge is huge and provides hot meal each night.  That was big plus of hotel.  And overall service was solid.  ",3,2023,06,24
120,Family Vacation,"We loved our stay here!! We were taken care of from the moment we walked in! Shout out to Tania (reception) & John (concierge)! Our daily breakfast was delicious! Big thanks to Daniel (makes AMAZING waffles & pancakes!) Our room were connected so its great for families & they customized the rooms for kids! They had mini stuffed animals, small bath robes & smaller slippers for kiddos! Its prime location- walking distance to the underground (metro) - follow the orange light poles hehe! Overall our stay was quite relaxing!! Thank u!!",5,2023,06,22
120,Upscale & clean hotel with friendly service,"My guestroom was clean, quiet and comfortable. While certain rooms have a view of a wall (as read on other reviews), the hotel was kind enough to provide me a room without this view upon request. The room's singular window was quite small (~1 meter wide), so it wasn't the brightest room I've experienced, but it wasn't dark either. The hotel was nicely furnished with updates and upscale décor. The breakfast had a good variety or foods, which were freshly prepared. The executive lounge had a nice happy hour spread including alcoholic beverages, but the lounge's offerings were slim outside of happy hour. Lastly, the hotel is located in a quieter area, that's neither close to nor far from London's main sites and attractions. 

Overall, an excellent hotel and I would stay here again.",5,2023,06,20
120,Service and amenities great,"The staff are amazing breakfast is amazing the room was amazing everything as a whole 10/10 one of the best hotels I r been to and again service inredible. Parking available 
Dinner is very nice had it once but it was still very nice and local to a station too. 
Amazing for family trips too very family friendly next time I will bring my children 100%",5,2023,06,18
120,Exceptional Stay!,"Wow! We are so enjoying our stay here. The location is perfect- easy to walk to some of the best attractions.  
It was our son's 7th birthday, and they went above & beyond to bring him a treat to our room. So thoughtful. It's the extra touches!! The rooms were well appointed, clean, spacious. The food & drinks, great. The real takeaway from our stay is the service!!! The Executive Lounge is bar none. We are frequent travelers, and Hilton Diamond members, thus, we've seen our share of lounges and properties. Hilton Bankside's Lounge is AHHHMAZING.  Sahil & Sanchita were wonderful!! Warm, welcoming, and so attentive. The staff here deserves a big kudos. 👏 thanks for kicking off our European Summer with this experience.",5,2023,06,18
120,See you next time,"First visit to this hotel and will certainly be back. Convenient location, comfortable and excellent staff. A special mention for Yen in the executive lounge, very kind, helpful and attentive. We visit London frequently on business and leisure. Our plans feature a return to Bankside in early July, see you then!",5,2023,06,17
120,Great team of friendly staff,"The team has been more than wonderful in making sure that I have a pleasure stay. Their positive energy is outstanding! 

Kudos to the concierge team in particular. They are more than proactive which is uncommon in my previous experience. The team at the front desk has made an extra effort for me to have my room ready before the official check-in time which is highly appreciated!",5,2023,06,16
120,Great stay!!,"I loved this location! Took a family trip to London and this is away enough from the hustle and bustle of the tourist places you will go, but very close to multiple underground stations and train stations that is it SUPER easy. Plus you are walking distance from some great hangouts by the Thames--so lovely. The breakfast is so awesome to fuel up for your day and the restaurants in the hotel are great too--the staff always have helpful tips! Lastly, it's well appointed, quiet when you sleep and a very, very attentive staff! Area has some really cute pubs and restaurants too! Thanks Hilton Bankside!",5,2023,06,15
120,Beautiful stay so far.,"Thank you very much for a beautiful stay so far. We are Hilton Diamond Members and we're greeted very warmly.
Also we had a great time in the Executive Lounge with Yen who has been above and beyond in her service.
The only thing to mention is that we did not get an update, which is unusual concerning the HHonors Status. Maybe the hotel is fully booked so we understand.",5,2023,06,14
120,Executive Lounge Needs Better Beer/Wine and Evening Snacks,"We stayed here many times from 2016-19, but this was our 1st time in almost 4 years. In the past, we usually arrived around 9 a.m. due to our early flight arrival at Gatwick.  This time we had a connecting flight through JFK and arrived at Heathrow in late morning.  We took 2 subway lines followed by a short walk from Southwark, which took just over an hour .  Upon arrival, we were greeted by Michaella (spelling ?).  It was almost 2p.m., and she stated that no rooms were yet available due to a full hotel the night before.  Also, the hotel was to be full on our 1st night so there were no Diamond upgrades available.  I overreacted and later apologized.  Unlike IHG, Hilton now tries to charge for upgrades, even for its top tier members.  Housekeeping should start cleaning rooms as early as possible since many check out before 9 a.m.???  I understand about the upgrade but think their system should automatically upgrade top tier members at time of reservation!  We waited in the Executive Lounge and Michaella brought our keys to Room 446 in less than 30 minutes.  I requested a upgrade for our last 2 nights, if possible, and did receive a text early on our 1st morning that one was available.  We had settled in our room and partially unpacked for our 3 night stay and turned down the offer for 1 major reason:  Room 446 had a tub; based on prior experience, tubs are not the norm here.  The room was smallish but had everything we needed for our stay.  The view was of the courtyard so we had to keep the shades closed since we had to walk by the window when going to/from  the bathroom from/to the bedroom area.  The TV was fine, the room was clean although the housekeeper I encountered was Ukrainian and spoke very little English.  I held up a gesture of support for her homeland and was able to let he know when we left so our room could be cleaned.  On morning 2, there was a male housekeeper so I indicated to him when we were leaving for lunch.  In summary for the room, no major complaints.  It was near the elevator but not too close, there was in a separate entry with another room so quieter, and the courtyard view also added a layer of noise protection.  We like to have breakfast in the main restaurant so that's what we did each morning.  It was good, but the omelet maker really didn't make omelets but scrambled eggs with the ingredients mixed in (i.e. not folded, cheese left out one morning, etc.-they were prepared and then cooked in a special skillet behind and in the window to the main kitchen area-not with the usual personal touches one uses to make such).  The bread choices were good but not as plentiful as I remember before COVID days.  The service was not as attentive as I remembered either as we had to get our own coffee (to start and to refill).  Basically, one was seated and on the 1st morning just pointed to the different options! Once they thought one knew the routine, they just took you to the table and smiled!  
My main issue on this stay was the Executive Lounge.  We prefer to save money and enjoy our evening snack (or small dinner) in the lounge after we have eaten a bigger lunch elsewhere in London.  The lounge food left a lot to be desired.  The first night was the best with broiled chicken legs, but the 2nd night was Indian night so I mainly just ate the rice and cold cuts and avoided the unknown dishes.  The 3rd night was slightly better but not so much.  One French kid on the 2nd night ate about 10 plates of just white rice.  I made a comment to him in French and his mother laughed!   The alcohol selection was good for a G&T (Beefeaters gin) plus a choice of regular or Slimline tonic with limes (for Americans/Canadians) and lemons (for Brits).  The wine and beer were downright pathetic.  There was one beer, an Italian one?? as well as 1 red and 1 white wine.  I think they were Spanish.  I have attached pics.  Why couldn't they offer a local ale or at least a high quality foreign one from a beer drinking country?  Why not offer a decent French or Italian wine or perhaps more choices, including rose (blush)?  Overall, the lounge was active during the food/drink time.  In conclusion about the hotel in general, this place used to be a bargain compared with other London properties, but now the prices have caught up to the expensive parts of town.  Although we like and are now used to the location, we may look elsewhere on our next visit to London.  With the Oyster Card, most of central London is doable.  This hotel is clean, most of the staff is welcoming, and the lounge still has potential!",4,2023,06,14
120,Fantastic customer service,"I recently had the pleasure of staying at Bankside, my experience was made primarily because of one outstanding individual - Nuria. From the moment I stepped into the lobby their exceptional dedication and commitment to providing outstanding customer service was evident. Her unwavering attention to detail and willingness to go above and beyond left a real mark on my stay.",5,2023,06,13
120,Bankside Hilton Hotel ,Great hotel with very comfortable rooms. Sahil in the Executive Lounge was very helpful and attentive. Good location for the City and the West End. The pool and gym are better than normal for a city centre hotel. ,5,2023,06,10
120,"Great location, great hotel!","The staff was welcoming and helpful (thank you for allowing us to check in earlier!). The rooms were clean and well appointed. The breakfasts were delicious and generous. Executive lounge was a special place to relax and we enjoyed the special treats. The location is close to many things and it’s also very easy to take the Tube from Southwark, or Uber boats from Bankside. Would definitely stay here again and recommend to others.",5,2023,06,10
120,Great Experience,We really enjoyed staying here on our family vacation with 2 little one. All of the staff was very helpful and always happy to help. I would recommend this to anyone who is going to be in the area. We had access to the executive lounge and it was great 👍.  ,5,2023,06,09
120,Best Concierge in London - Zalan!,"During a recent trip to London I was transferring from the Hilton London Bankside to another hotel. Unfortunately, a massive bike race was scheduled that day and many streets surrounding my second hotel were blocked and barricaded. I had two large pieces of luggage (not allowed on the Underground) and had injured my back. I tried to reach my second hotel via Uber but the driver became frustrated (to the point of tears) and returned me to the Hilton Bankside. That is when I found Zalan, who I believe may be the best concierge in London. Even though I had checked out of the hotel, he secured my luggage and helped my to develop an action plan. After numerous phone calls and conversations with various drivers, he was able to find a taxi which would attempt to deposit me close to my hotel. Throughout the day he was polite and courteous. The bike race had crippled the city and he was also working with other clients and on many other problems. Despite this, Zalan was calm, reassuring and professional. And, he found the perfect driver who knew when and how to negotiate the barricades and reach my hotel. Thank you, Zalan!",5,2023,06,09
120,Accessible review of Hilton Bankside,"I've been staying at the Hilton Bankside for many years now as it is one of the best in terms of wheelchair accessibility.

Everyone i have ever met here are so friendly and helpful, never met somebody who was rude or uninterested in guests. A big thank you to John from Concierge who always makes every stay great just with his jokes and friendliness!

The accessible bedroom has a king bed and also connects to a twin or king room. There is space on the right side of the bed for a wheelchair but the left is closer to the wall and may be a squeeze. The wardrobe is on the left as you come in, just past the bathroom door and has an ironing board, safe, slippers, robes and a pull-down wardrobe rail, although it did jam on the door last time i tried it but maybe we had it at the wrong angle! Then opposite the bed you have a long unit with a desk and cabinets with tea drawer, fridge and storage - the Border biscuits are a lovely treat each day! Although i do persomally feel that the room needs more lighting - when it gets to the evening, the room is pretty dull and for somebody with a visual impairment, it may not be the most comfortable.

Now the bathroom is stunning! I love it when a hotel bathroom actually looks modern and fits in with the theme and design of the room as a while, rather than being all white and clinical so a fantastic job there! For me, i need to be able to do a left-hand transfer onto the toilet/shower bench and both objects are positioned exactly as i need it. Great shower pressure and a sturdy bench to sit on, small wall mounted trays for your own items but also large pump bottles attached to the wall. Great sink space and a huge mirror! The only thing for me is that the sink is sooo deep that i can't get my wheelchair underneath so have to sit sideways, it is pretty uncomfortable on my back but again, everything works well so it's not the end of the world!

The Oxbo restaurant where breakfast is served is fully accessible, chairs can be moved if needed and the staff are more than happy to help rearrange the furniture! Breakfast is a good selection of meats/cheeses/fruit/pastries/cereals/cooked - on a recent stay, noticed they stopped serving salmon (sad face) and almond croissants, my companion mentioned it when we were leaving and the next day they had some baked for us! There is such a great service at Hilton Bankside. Although it would be lovely...if they did an afternoon tea so we could stay in for the day but wishful thinking :D",4,2023,06,07
120,The worst check in experience of my life,"Never in my life anywhere in the world have I experienced such a bad check in experience.
After 10 hours of travelling we arrived at reception ( only one on duty ) to be offered water.
Others get offered prosecco !
The receptionist told us our boking had not been paid for by British Airways.
I said it had.
She said no, you must pay again to get a room.
£3400, I don't think so !!!!
I called BA who spoke to the girl and explained what to do. I just put down the phone and she said it hasn't gone through !
Back on hold forever to BA for another agent to explain to the girl what to do.
She said she understood, well she didn't !
I showed her emails and message from BA, she said they weren't proof I had paid !!?? and could I show her bank statements ! Really ? Well NO.
She had a terrible attitude and was so adamant she was right, and would not back down.
It was only after an hour, and intervention from two other receptionists that the check in got sorted.
She did not apologise to us, or to BA
In her mind she was correct !

The room was nice. It was quiet.
Cleaning was fine, but the bathroom floor did not get washed in 8 days.
It was a very dark room, as was the bathroom, difficult to see.
We had to climb inside a very deep bath to have a shower.

The lounge staff were very nice, as were concierge .
Some of the receptionists and guest relations staff were not at all helpful or knowledgeable.

I emailed management on 29th May whilst in the hotel but received no response.",1,2023,06,07
120,Stay in deluxe style,"I stayed at the Hilton London Bankside during my business trip to London May 21-22 and I couldn't even imagine how amazing this hotel is inside. I want to express my deep gratitude to the hotel team, my check-in went without issues, the room was prepared for my arrival. I was so pleased to see a personal greeting and a handmade sweets compliment. The hotel is very clean and beautiful, I was amazed by extraordinarily design of room, bathroom and bed - a work of art. I was especially impressed by the serving of dishes at breakfast, how the buffet was decorated, on the one hand, this is a high Hilton standard, but even inside the standard the team found features that made the serving very interesting. In this cozy room I was able to prepare for my presentation (by the way it passed very successful, and this is partly the merit of the hotel team, because my stop was in good hands). Among other things, from the features of the hotel, I can highlight that the hotel is conveniently located near my favorite Tate Modern Gallery, as well as Southwark and Waterloo stations. Thanks again to the hotel team and management for a wonderful stay I wish you all the best.",5,2023,06,05
120,Great hotel -- great weekend,Great Hotel. Upgrade to lounge well worth it to relax with drinks before going into the city. All staff were super friendly and helpful. Kamaal and Daniel were great.  Breakfast excellent. Thanks for everything. ,5,2023,06,05
120,Love the property but staff doesn’t balance with that,"I felt I was treated differently to others
Intrusive staff
I had a very important meeting and arranged a late check out for 2.15pm 
I had 3/4 phone calls throughout the morning and if not answered would ring for long periods , twice house keeping knocking on door all of this to see if I was checking out , my manager cancled because of the interruptions and rescheduled for the next day which meant I had to book another night as it needed to be in Bankside location. I had brought monitors with me that were 65 inch, I ended up breaking 1 of the screens because of being rushed, when leaving I was waiting for the company to come and collect the screen as Hilton would not dispose of it they would not check me out otherwise so I asked if i x  ask have a key to go sit in the E lounge while I wait and get a cup of tea, reception replies , I need to ask if you can still get access as I have checked out at this point I thought I had but actually I hadnt but even so.i I know that this is not true but yet she continued after to say  she called a manager and asked if I could get a tea ,and as I listened I could tell they were talking about me by the level answers she was giving and looking back at the monitor once or twice. I saw 2 guys who work for my company all checked out but sat there on theirs pc’s I spoke to them asking if they are leaving both said yes they checked out and was let in with no problems, I just got the tea and came back out as by now all I wanted was to get out of the hotel and never return ",1,2023,06,04
120,Still one of my favourite Hilton properties in London,"My wife and I stayed here for just one night as part of our wedding anniversary celebration.
I emailed the hotel prior to arrival to make them aware of the occasion and when we arrived, we found we had been upgraded to a very nice king one bedroom suite.
We are both HH Diamond members but this was a serious upgrade, several room grades above what I had booked, so we were both very grateful and surprised. When we returned to the room after our day and evening of celebrations, a cake had been delivered to the room, which was also a nice touch.

I like the rooms here as they are spacious, modern and comfortable. The suite was, of course very nice, with a separate sitting room, huge shower in the bathroom and a separate bath.

The whole hotel has modern, contemporary decor and is finished and furnished to a high standard.

The indoor pool is a nice, relaxing place.

The executive lounge is a decent size, comfortable and again, a nice relaxing space. Various bottled beers, red and white wine, prosecco and branded spirits were on offer between 6pm and 8pm, along with a selection of hot and cold food. The bar is good and again, a cool place to hang out, although you obviously pay London prices. Breakfast in the main restaurant is always really good, with plenty of choice.
Overall, as per the title, one of my favourite Hilton properties in London. Thank you to all of the staff who helped to make this a special and memorable stay.",5,2023,06,01
120,Nothing special this stay,"Four night stay from Sun - Thu.

Pleasant check in by Nuria, thanks for diamond member. Fourth floor room. 

Asked if first time stay, advised no and stayed 2-3 occasions before. Sorry as you are staying 4 nights we cant offer any upgrade. If it was just one night would have been fine, but thanks for being diamond member. Never heard this before.

Room 414 was fine, clean, soft drink and water in fridge. No issue with WiFi or hot water.

Went to the Exec lounge for coffee. Regrettable both machines had fault errors on them so not coffee.

One issue I had was upon taking a shower the towel was like sandpiper literally. They were better the other days to be fair. Coming back one night, the cleaner didn’t put the floor towel down.

On two other nights, I came back the next day with the prior nights tea mug left as is (yes there was a very small amount left). They had put a paper cover over the mug. Other night the pop bottle was left on the desk!

Had a quick breakfast two days. On the Thursday, I felt a little aggrieved, three guests in front of me were asked for room numbers as we got to the host. Upon my turn, I was asked for room number, then name. Yes I reconfirm that happened. One day shown to table, other day not.

Upon checking out, colleague didn’t ask how my stay was and ‘I will sort it out’. I didn’t receive a questionnaire after my stay either.

No receipt for expenses. Messaged on app after stay. Not once, but twice. It came then.

The hotel is very convenient to where I work and we book many rooms over the year. I don’t have much better choice.

Perhaps a one off. Let’s see.

I won’t ask for an upgrade again here and nor do I expect one.",2,2023,05,31
120,Great service,OXBO brunch was lovely and very good value for money. Our servers Jagsuti &Marcia were very attentive and we would definitely come again. The mix between snacks and nibbles is really well done and would recommend ,5,2023,05,28
120,"Good location, nice pool but 1 or 2 little things to improve","The hotel is very conveniently located on Bankside.  The rooms are compact and a little dark but, well equipped, cleaned and comfortable.  Bathroom was lovely and nice to have a bath and a good shower.   Always good to have big bath sheets and nice robes too. Reception staff were polite and efficient but not particularly friendly and welcoming.

Easy to drop off bags and text message when room was ready is good.  Concierge staff were friendly, a nice glass of Prosecco was offered when we arrived.   I was a bit surprised that they didn’t know how to direct us to the Old Vic theatre, which is very close to them.

Basement swimming pool is lovely and, a quick dip was an ideal way to start the day.  Unfortunately, we missed placing a breakfast order as we didn’t see the card. With no breakfast served at the restaurant, a reminder about placing an order when checking in would have been nice.

My one real criticism is that staff stand at the main entrance to smoke, there was even an overflowing ashtray left on top of the large letters spelling out Bankside by the front door - very off putting!",3,2023,05,28
120,Outstanding,"What an amazing experience. 

The customer service I have experienced has been the best I’ve received as a diamond member. 
Nuria on front desk was exceptional from check in to checkout. I have stayed in many hilton properties and Nuria was one of the best receptionist by far! 
Sanchita, Terrance and Olivia have given the best executive lounge experience, table service throughout our visit and ensuring our glasses were always replenished, 5 * service.

We will definitely be back and would highly recommend this property when in London. 

Thank you for the superb hospitality!",5,2023,05,27
120,Disappointing Stay,"Very disappointing, made the booking 5 months in advance for a wedding anniversary and requested a room with a nice view. On entering the room, we were faced with instant darkness due to a huge towering brick-wall directly outside our window with zero visibility!  When this issue was raised, we were informed the hotel was fully booked so no chance to change rooms. We did receive entry to the executive lounge and thought this might be able to soften the room issue until we first used the lounge first thing the next morning for breakfast. On entry there was instantly no atmosphere, although we perused and sat down to eat. It was a self-service but many items not available and having to request each time to a waiter who disappeared for several minutes at a time. I guess they were understaffed as we learned he was also trying to cater for the main restaurant at the same time. Tucking in to the cooked so-called fresh food was an instant turnoff, all items were stone cold which had clearly been sitting around untouched. Drinks in the bar in the evening was our last resort of getting something out of our stay and trying to enjoy our anniversary stay. We waited up to 30 minutes without being served after being told to find a seat and a waiter will be with you. We ended up leaving without getting a drink and checked out of the hotel early.

120,A second wonderful stay,Stayed in this hotel for the second time and had had an amazing stay again. Tania at reception was kind and very helpful. The next morning at check out there was an Indian girl I presume who was also very helpful and friendly. Overall loved my stay and will definitely be returning. ,5,2023,05,24
120,Modern haven on the best side of the Thames,"Modern haven on the best side of the Thames.  Clean, well appointed rooms with an excellent bathroom.  Joseph made our stay out of this world with his advice.  Near to the Tate and close to public transportation (it is London).  Totally recommended.",5,2023,05,23
120,Hilton London Bankside Hotel,"Great hotel and great location.  Staff especially Terence, Sanchita, Sajishmidand Waha B were all great in the lounge for happy hour.  Very attentive.

We can't say enough about all the staff from check in to concierge to wait staff about how awsome they all are.  thank you for a great stay in London",5,2023,05,22
120,Recommended choice,"The hotel is first class. The hotel is located in a good location with reasonably good connections. The hotel has versatile services, first-class breakfast and very friendly service. The hotel is suitable for both business and leisure travelers. The City of London area with its restaurants and services is within walking distance and the magnificent Tate Modern is right next door.",4,2023,05,22
120,Another phenomenal visit!,"Had an amazing stay (again)! Hilton London Bankside punches way above its weight by acting like a luxury hotel.  The location is great as it sits near Borough Market, Tate Modern, and St Paul's.  The executive lounge is fantastic.  The facilities and rooms are clean, roomy, and spacious.  But most of all, the service is friendly and outstanding! Kamaal, the concierge, is awesome and super helpful!  We really enjoyed talking with him and getting great suggestions/advice from him.  Jeongbeen gave us a warm welcome as he checked us in.  The other staff at the hotel and OXBO restaurant (sorry do not remember names) were wonderful as well! The amenities and service are top notch - lovely to return after a nice day around London!",5,2023,05,22
120,Very good - just one hiccup,"We had a lovely time.  A very friendly welcome and helpful staff. 

Despite booking a twin and being told the room would be a twin, we found ourselves in a double. It took a couple of hours to be sorted out, so we went for a swim - lovely. 

The room was calm, extremely clean, the bed so comfortable and we had a very good sleep. The shower was powerful and the towels fluffy. 

We can’t wait to return and properly enjoy the breakfast and restaurant.",4,2023,05,21
120,"Great Hotel, Even Better Service!",Went with my sisters and had an absolute blast. The staff took great care of us as we jet lagged as hell when we arrived. Everyone including Nasir at the front desk and Daniel the doorman made sure we felt right at home. Exquisite service! Would highly recommend this to folks who want close access to the sites but some piece and quiet!,5,2023,05,19
120,Good Hilton property,Nice Hilton property. Good amenities and good location. Daniel Doorman always had a welcoming smile. They are clean and the lobby smells so good lol Their signature smells for the soap and lotions are a huge plus. ,5,2023,05,19
120,Fantastic stay at the Hilton London Bankside,"We had a wonderful five night stay at the Hilton London Bankside in April.  We were greeted by Daniel the doorman with a smile and a glass of Prosecco upon arrival and we knew it was going to be a good stay. Daniel greeted us every time we entered the lobby and he sets the tone for the high level of service we received throughout our stay. Robert the bellhop was friendly and helpful as was the concierge and front desk staff. Special kudos to Sahil and the rest of the team in the Executive Lounge - it is one of the nicer lounges we have encountered in terms of comfort, offerings and service. Breakfast was outstanding and special thanks to Verdiana, Anna and the rest of the friendly, helpful team.  The location is excellent - a short walk to multiple tube stations and close to the Tate Modern, Globe Theatre and Borough Market, all of which we enjoyed. Will definitely stay here again the next time we visit London.  ",5,2023,05,18
120,We were wowed.,"Where to begin. This hotel wowed us not only with a beautiful, well appointed one bedroom suite, but with an attentive helpful staff that went above and beyond. The suite was large with a living room, bedroom, full large bath and additional half bath. It was a cozy, dark color scheme that enveloped you and we found it relaxing. Plush robes, unexpected snacks and a fridge were great additions. Nightly turndown service was appreciated. The executive lounge was furnished with sofas and a gas fireplace. Standard fare during the day and we were unable to partake in happy hour but it was offered daily. The breakfast buffet was outstanding. Smoked trout and prawns were something we hadn’t seen before for breakfast. Bravo on a job well done. 

The staff helped us with our transportation challenges as we unexpectedly got caught up in the coronation road blocks and disruptions. John, hats off to you. Your directions to the Thames link saved us time and aggravation. Thanks again for literally walking us to the corner and showing us the way. We will absolutely stay here again next time we are in town.",5,2023,05,14
120,Fantastic Brunch.,What a great brunch once again our third time here and it just seems to get better. Our servers Patrick and Livia were just fantastic our glasses were never empty. Will definitely be returning again Thanks Oxbo Bankside for a lovely afternoon with family.,5,2023,05,13
120,Lovey night on the South bank,"Lovely luxury hotel, great people with a great ethic for customer service on a quiet street close to Tate Modern and ten minutes taxi from Waterloo station.

We arrived late morning had a lovely welcome and were given a lovely room upgrade.

Whilst waiting to meet family we had a liquid lunch (cocktails and a snack) and another when they arrived before walking off to enjoy Borough Market and Tower bridge, having a lovely meal out and then back in time to enjoy happy hour in the executive club.

Had an exhausted nights sleep and a fabulous breakfast which was included for us.

A lovely stay the hotel did their best to enhance!",5,2023,05,11
120,Doesn’t get better than this!,"This was an unexpected pleasure just days after the coronation of King Charles III. While relaxing in the Executive Club after a full day roaming the streets of London, we were well taken care of by Yen, ensuring we had the best experience of all Hilton places. Job well done! Thank you Yen. ",5,2023,05,10
120,Great stay and location.,Room was spotless. Amenities replenished everyday. Front desk personal helpful as well as informative about the areas attractions. Restaurant on hotel premises excellent especially the Sunday roast. Would stay there again.,5,2023,05,10
120,Great location and nice business lounge - no lounge bfast on weekdays,"Great hotel in a nice location, close to public transport, shops and the markets. We had a club room and did feel the room was a little under done. Quite empty and a view out to a wall. Club lounge only offers breakfast on weekends, which we hadn’t realised. Afternoon drinks and canapés were ok. Staff were friendly and overall nice stay.",4,2023,05,09
120,A hidden gem in London - Hilton Bankside,"This hotel is a hidden gem in London.   For decades, we used to stay in a hotel very near the Westminster bridge.  We decided to change our preference  after reading the horrible reviews it recently has been receiving.   I am so glad we did.

The Hilton London Bankside  has a competent group of people running the place.   I met a minor ( yet extremely painful) accident in the city on the 2nd day of our stay.  We reached out for assistance and they went out of their way to assist us in every way.  This is something I could not envision most hotels in London would do knowing how busy everyone is in London.   My husband and I were pleasantly surprised and grateful for this.

Our room was always kept clean despite our staying longer indoors because of my accident.  Their food – both in the restaurant and room service was good.  They respond to their guest’s request within a reasonable time frame.  

Wifi was excellent.  It is within reasonable distance to everywhere in London.  Several convenient stores are within walking distance from the hotel which is really good for any tourist.

Really an overall great experience staying in this hotel.  It is one of those  hotels that still believe that service is a huge part of customer satisfaction.  

We have found a new hotel to call “home” when in London.  Thank you very much.",5,2023,05,09
120,A toast to the Hilton Bankside,Again outstanding service from concierge Daniel who greeted us with champagne after we came back from the coronation! What a surprise and delight. Their happy hour is outstanding with a variety of foods and drinks.  And they easily accommodated my gluten allergy.  ,5,2023,05,08
120,Executive lounge experience,"Experienced the executive lounge and the staff made it go from nice to exceptional.  Those that were most tentative were Terence, Sanchita and Sajisma. Hospitality like no other. Thank you for making our evening so carefree and enjoyable ",5,2023,05,07

120,Great experience,Really good. Our server Jagsuti and younas were so good! So attentive! They deserve a promotion for their attention to detail!

120,Coronation brunch,Absolutely great experience and worth the price for brunch. Visited coronation weekend with a few friends and stayed quite a long time enjoying the live music and drinks. Eggs florentine and roast beef main was great!  Definitely coming back. ,5,2023,05,07

120,Birthday Brunch at OXBO,Took my sister for brunch on her birthday to OXBO and the four course brunch was so good! This is my second time at OXBO and I didn’t disappoint. We were looked after by Jagruti & Mayur who were so amazing! Can’t wait to be back! :) ,5,2023,05,06

120,Superb,"Third visit and really cannot fault this superb hotel, every staff member goes out of their way to help - Dani, Yen, Sanchita to name the ones whose names I recall - and the fantastic receptionist (forgot his name but  we chatted for ages and he poured us Prosecco as we waited our room). Room worth waiting for - spotless and clean suite.  I have stayed in lots of Hilton hotels and this really is the best.",5,2023,05,04
120,Continues with excellent standards.,"Have stayed here a few times although not since Covid. I have stayed in a couple of London hotels where standards have fallen since pre-covid, but not here. Check in was efficient and quick and great Hilton Diamond member upgrade to accommodate my daughter who was travelling with me. Lovely exec lounge and evening food provided in it was very good and an excellent selection of alcoholic and non-alcoholic drinks. Room was well furnished and modern, bathroom had large shower rather than a bath which may not suit all. Breakfast was very good although surprisingly no baked beans. Daughter was impressed by spa and swimming pool.  Well located for Tate Modern and Borough Market and not too far a walk for theatres around Covent Garden. Certainly my Hilton of choice for this part of Central London.",5,2023,05,01
120,Rude staff,"Bar staff very rude no manners what so ever no need to be rude when we asked for something or even asked for the bill breakfast not up to scratch cold coffee dry food and not worth the money to be fare when we did try and raise the issue the manager from
The hotel was very dismissive and rude ",2,2023,05,01
120,Excellent crew made for an excellent stay,"A clean, comfortable and new hotel is the perfect formula - but what really puts it over the top to make the experience superb....were employees like the concierge, doorman Daniel and lounge staff Sanchita, Yen and Terence were courteous, helpful and responsive to requests.

120,Our new favorite hotel when in London,"This has become one of our favorite places to stay in London. Great location, wonderful breakfast, nice amenities, and an excellent executive lounge. The executive lounge wait staff, Yen and Terrance, were especially friendly and attentive as well as the rest of the hotel staff. We always look forward to returning. ",5,2023,04,28

A particular thanks to Yen and Terrance whose hospitality was first class throughout my stay. I will definitely be coming back!",5,2023,04,27
120,Not feel welcomed,"This stay is just fine. We have stayed at Hilton London Bankside for 3 nights. The room was arranged at 712. When we arrived the room, the small window surprised us. It’s a very small window and not allowed too much light coming through. That makes the room too dark. We look forward a bit brighter room, so we came to front desk and discussed with the lady if any chance to change to a room with a big window. The lady said no room is available. Thus, we told the lady we could accept to downgrade the room as long as the room with bigger window. The lady is still very cool and saying no room available. She recommended us to come to front desk again in the next morning. We were disappointed by the lady’s attitude. She is too cool and feel  like we are not welcomed. 
After the communication with the front desk, we accepted the room. When we went out of the hotel and observed the building. We realized most of the rooms are equipped with small window. It’s really not easy to get a room with bigger window. However, if the receptionist could explain more in details, we would understand and not feel disappointed.",3,2023,04,26
120,Fabulous,"Love oxbo bankside  saturday brunch, great starter and  dessert  buffet . Lots of choice  and for everybody  taste . Then off to the kitchen for hot starter cooked in demand , followed  by main course  , fish, meat, veg  cooked by the kitchen  all this with unlimited  bubbly.

120,Customer service and overall stay was top rate,"This is a fantastic hotel. It is incredibly convenient in location to the South Bank area and train/tube stations but also to grocery and drug stores to feel at home. The staff here is top rate. Always professional. Greetings all the time across the lobby. At check-in and throughout my stay Nuria was especially helpful and assisted me with figuring out laundry services and a lot more. Thank you, Nuria! Also the rooms are great. Views are great from 7th floor. The laundry service received my order in the morning and had it back by noon. Incredibly good service. Overall a great experience and I hope I’ll be back",5,2023,04,26
120,Modern and clean hotel,"Loved this hotel! The staff was incredibly friendly. Daniel the doorman was always welcoming. The breakfast was very good at 20 pounds per person. Not very close to central London but can still walk to all the major attractions. Borough Market is very close and has a great variety of different foods. 
The rooms were very modern and clean.",5,2023,04,25
120,Amazing as always,"Another great stay at Bankside this time with my daughter - excellent front desk team led by Ms Kim, John at concierge is the best, and well looked after by Sanchita and Yen Ly in the lounge.

Wish i could go every week! ",5,2023,04,25
120,Perfection,"From the moment I stepped into the foyer and then welcomed by Nuria my experience at Hilton Bankside was nothing short of perfection. 

The staff are truly exceptional here, very friendly, nothing is too much trouble.

Fantastic room overlooking the Shard.  Super quiet too, you would not think you were in central London. 

Great nights sleep and a fantastic breakfast served in my room. 

Perfection. ",5,2023,04,25

120,"Nice, but VERY Expensive..... £3.50 for 200ml bottle of coke (can is 330ml)","Stunning hotel, nice bar & restaurant.  If £3.50 for a 200ml bottle of coke is you thing then you'll love it....... 👍. It's not bad, just hard to find value for money with such price gouging.  But, we are stupid for paying it.......its a 6/10 would be more if the price for the rediculus drinks was slightly less outrageous. ",3,2023,04,23

120,Great hotel for Families,"The hotel was nice and comfortable. We booked it for the adjoining family room. We were expecting cute fox bedding and such, but it was not there. We were tired, so we didn’t ask. However, the next day, Daniel and the other doormen were so kind to our kids and gave them each a little stuffed fox and cups. They’ve played with the foxes so much and thought it was very special during their trip to London. Overall it was a comfy hotel that catered to families which made it a good experience!",4,2023,04,21
120,A Gem of a Hotel,"The entire experience was outstanding. Our first encounter upon arrival was with the the doorman, Daniel. He was friendly, polite , accommodating and knowledgeable.  He certainly contributed to making our visit enjoyable. He is an asset to the hotel and it was very obvious that he loves his job. 

The hotel offered, luxurious accommodations , dining and facilities. I highly recommend staying here as it is conveniently located. You can walk to many of the beautiful bridges very easily from the hotel. It is also convenient to The Eye, as well as The Shard and St. Paul’s Cathedral. 

I definitely recommend staying there and possibly meeting Daniel.",5,2023,04,20
120,Worthy business hotel,"Great Hilton hotel on the Southbank, travelled for business and the executive lounge always has welcoming staff.

The staff are always so courteous, helpful and friendly.  Once again thanks to Daniel the Doorman for putting up with listening to my attempts to speak some Italian (the only practice I get outside of Duolingo!!).  Also the executive lounge is first rate and we would like to thank Sajishma, Sanchita and Abi for their excellent service.  The location is excellent, very close to Tate Modern, great for walking along the South Bank and easy walk to St Paul's or even central London (Trafalgar Square is only 30 minutes away).  Very wide choice of food at breakfast, nice swimming pool which never seems busy and hotel lobby and reception staff always very welcoming.  Well worth a stay.",5,2023,04,16

We traveled to the Hilton bank side w our parents and 7yo child and the ENTIRE TEAM was so accommodating. Roberto and Joseph went above and beyond with constant courtesies…Roberto even took my 7yo through the property to make sure he “caught” all the 49 foxes. As a parent, that’s what I love!

120,"Great location, great for families!",Hilton Bankside was perfect for my family of 4 who needed a landing spot for our London trip.

Sanchita and Sahil were so friendly and welcomed us each night.  Thank you!,5,2023,04,11

120,Clearly Not Wanted,"As a Hilton Gold member and solo woman traveler who visits London 3-4 times a year, I had high hopes for this hotel. Unfortunately, those hopes were dashed. 

It’s clear that staff from doorman (Daniel specifically) to reception to concierge decide to reward “certain” guests with warm greetings, Prosecco upon arrival, upgrades for Gold/Diamond members, information about the Executive Lounge and other perks they deserve. Plus, they enjoy Executive King rooms that are bright and light with city views. The “others” receive none of those things. 

I was a designated “other.” No greeting, no upgrade, no Prosecco, a depressingly dark room overlooking a dark and filthy gravel courtyard. No mention of lounge access and had to request that my key card be scanned to include it, and then found only one card could access the lounge. 

And now more about the ""famous"" Daniel who repeatedly glared at me with a death stare whenever I entered the lobby. He even started to approach me as if I were trespassing in his hotel and didn't belong there. Frightening and unsettling, to say the least!

When I mentioned this treatment to a young concierge staff member, he indicated it could be how I was dressed. Um, I’m in fashion retail and dress in designer separates and artisan jewelry. But that’s still not good enough, apparently, for a four-star Hilton. (It's not a 5-star hotel by any standard.)

The Lounge food and drink,  which I paid for, but never would have been able to access if I hadn’t demanded it, redeemed this property from getting one star. 

Special thanks to Sanjita(?) or Sanjiyama(?) in the Lounge for her lovely, gracious service. She was also the only staff member who didn’t shill for a TA mention so they could receive a bonus. 

This hotel felt like a mediocre country club that was set up to exclude people of certain cultural and religious backgrounds. I’ve never felt so unwanted. And please, do not reply to this review with the same tired, canned response. Show some dignity.  ",2,2023,04,10
120,Excellent hotel - warm and welcoming staff,"Lovely, welcoming hotel - nice touches such as full complements of bathroom accessories and excellent haidryer. Staff is exceptionel. Cecilia at breakfast is always smiling and very helpful. Enjoyed our stay and hope to be back soon",5,2023,04,10

120,Sublime ,"Our stay was sublime from start to finish. We stayed in a one bedroom suite for  my husband’s special birthday. Greeted by Daniel , the doorman, and with a glass of fizz. Met Kim, a manager at check in, and Keya who were also welcoming and warm. The team all seemed really happy to be part of Hilton bankside and the guest experience. We experienced modern   exemplary service. 

A really funky place. Nice little touch with their ‘fox’ theme dotted subtly around  ( found the plaque outside! ) and the little fox card to let us know Anastasia had cleaned our suite. It was spotless . 

Enjoyed cocktails in the distillery bar, looked after by Sam, Gabriel and Annie. Gabriel was a master of his craft. 

All guests have access to the pool and gym. Lovely pool. 

I recommend  getting a room with executive lounge access if you can. We enjoyed complimentary afternoon  tea and early evening canapés and drinks in the lounge. 

A well positioned hotel. Short stroll to Tate Modern and great for borough market too. 
We will definitely find an excuse to go back.

120,Excellent service & property,"100% excellence here...every staff member (including Daniel at the door, John at the desk, staff in the Executive Lounge, housekeeping, etc) provided 1st class service. I feel like hugging them when we return from our other travels! We want to live here permanently. Very cute fox items for kids. Great location with access to the riverwalk in both directions. We walked to Westminster Abbey to attend a service -- also walked to the Tower of London and back (in a circle)(boat is another option). Very close to the Blackfriars train stop (Thameslink) for easy access to St Pancras/Kings Cross and short walk to Euston. Amazon Fresh across the street and many restaurants around. Breakfast buffet is extensive. Evening reception in the Executive Lounge is also extensive and generous. We are at another Hilton now and we miss Bankside!!! There wasn't one thing to complain about or feel disappointed about at Bankside. PERFECT stay.",5,2023,04,01
120,Night out,"I had a really nice time, Thankyou for having us. Daniel the doorman looked after us, and he’s energy was really lovly. Thankyou again. Love the Hiltons, will be back and the breakfast was delicious. ",5,2023,04,01
120,A great hotel,"Boyfriend and I came to London for 2 nights. We wanted a hotel that wasn’t too central, but equally not too far from Theatre district. 

Upon arrival we were greeted by Joseph, the doorman - a very polite gentleman who took our luggage. 
Check in at the desk, smooth process, & we were given a glass of complimentary Prosecco. Boyfriend opted for the valet parking service, for simple ease and confidence the car would be in safe hands. £40 a night, not cheap but equally we knew it would be somewhere safe. We needed an item collecting from the car, and Daniel went and retrieved this for us, with no issues. Delightful and friendly doorman. 

Room - a queen size bed, which great facilities. Usual tea/coffee machine in the room, albeit stored away so took some hunting to find. Mini fridge also available, albeit not stocked. 
Air con in the room which personally I turned off as found it too cold but great feature given there are no functioning windows in the rooms. 

Two nights we opted for room service from the menu. We could have gone out into the area but for ease decided to try the food from the menu. We opted for the Club sandwich which was divine, followed by Mango sorbet and a chocolate and salted caramel dessert. A very yummy and satisfying dinner. 
Breakfast was also very good - lots to choose from, catering for all dietary requirements which I thought was really good to see. 

Checkout, like check in, the process was an absolute breeze. Joseph and Daniel packed up the car with the luggage, and we were on our way. 

All in all this is a good hotel. It’s not too central but is in good walking distance to woke of the well known places, ie Tate Modern, Shakespeare Globe, to name jut a few. 

Would I stay here again? Yes.",5,2023,03,28
120,Review from 2 nights stay,"A nice contemporary Hilton hotel. The staff were very friendly and helpful. We stayed there for two nights. The down side, our bed has a little bit of urine odor and made my son skin itchy. As a diamond member, I should ask to change rooms but we forgot to inform the reception, because we would leave the hotel early and come back in the evening.",3,2023,03,27
120,Outstanding experience,"Excellent experience all around. Nice property. Full service restaurant with very good food. Excellent executive lounge  - Sanchita, Regina, and Yen were outstanding daily hosts. Very nice pool and fitness center. Very attentive service at every turn: John/concierge, room service, and in-room dining. Solid location walkable to the Thames. ",5,2023,03,27
120,Amazing staff!,"Had a great experience at the Hilton Bankside! Sanchita, Regina, and Yen took AMAZING care of us in the executive lounge! All of the staff were incredibly kind, attentive and extremely friendly! Will definitely come back soon! ",5,2023,03,27
120,Terrible experience not the 5* experience expected!,"Having stayed there for three nights, there were different issues each night. On the first night, we were provided with a room with a non-functional air condition, given that the windows can't open, the room had no airflow. Despite having asked the engineering team to fix it, the hotel did not fix the issue until the second day, leading to terrible sleep quality on day 1. Although the hotel was fully booked, it doesn't seem right to give guests a room while knowing that the room had a room that was defective. On the second night, Jaypee was kind enough to change the room for us as the hotel had no fans on hand. This was decent but was a downgrade in room categories, however, this was understandable given that it was late at night. On the third night, I was given a room upgrade. When I first entered the new room, it turned out that reception had provided me with a space that was occupied at that time, which was frightening and unacceptable. The second room provided was fine however when I asked to have the sofa bed to be made up, it was not made for the entire day, leading to my friend having to sleep on a bed with no bedding leading to another sleepless night. 

Overall, this is a hotel that's not worth visiting even for Hilton members. ",2,2023,03,27
120,Nice room with a bad view,"The hotel was clean. The staff was pleasant. The food was decent. Unfortunately my room open up to a brick wall so the view was horrible. Overall, I was very pleased with the service in the quality of the hotel to include the staff. I just would have chosen a better view if I had the opportunity.",5,2023,03,26
120,FANTASTIC,"This was our first trip to London and the Hilton Bankside was absolutely wonderful and accommodating. The concierges, especially John, Jefferson, and Kamaal, were beyond helpful. They treated us as family and were amazing to our kids. The Hilton as a whole was a wonderful experience for our kids: from the nightly turndown service to pancakes for breakfast to the pool, our kids loved the hotel and the staff. Speaking of breakfast, WOW that spread! The meal was a blessing to our family each morning - especially since one of us has to be Gluten-Free. The staff was very allergy-alert and helped us make the best choices. The Distillery downstairs was also a great place to sit and relax for a drink, and enjoy ice cream for the kids. We had a GREAT experience and would recommend Hilton Bankside over and over. ",5,2023,03,25
120,Night away,"Second time staying at this hotel and want to come back for more!
Very welcoming check in with Alexandra and Mekhyla given a fantastic room thank you. Hilton diamond member so always have executive lounge access which is a must. Complimentary drinks and evening meal. After our night out I must say had the most comfortable bed, we did not want to leave divine!!
Swim is an added bonus. Will be back soon",5,2023,03,22
120,A quality overnight stay,"If you are expecting a luxurious Hilton Hotel this is not it. I was surprised at the plain and somewhat outdated decor of the hallways and rooms. Still, a very good place to stay. The room was indeed very clean and comfortable and I would give it a seven out of ten overall. All interactions with the staff were very courteous and professional. It never ceases to astonish me just how good staff members are with helping guests. The Hilton staff were very efficient and courteous in a most genuine fashion in making sure we were set up for the next leg of our trip. ",4,2023,03,21
120,Excellent 5* hotel,Great place to stay - excellent breakfast - service was great - shout to Daniel the doorman - he was very good at helping us. Only real challenge is the location - its a bit away from the centre of London - but behind London South Bank & near the Millennium Bridge - 15 minute walk to the theatre district - which for me was fine - but wife found it a struggle - there were a number of good restaurants near by - the hotel does good food as well.,4,2023,03,20
120,Family trip with kids ,"We did spring break vacation as a family of 5. The family interconnecting room allowed us to have our space and the kids their own space. The rooms are spacious, lots of closet space and large bathroom. The king room has a tub and standing showers. The atmosphere is quiet and relaxing. The staff are all pleasant and offer hospitality, which is something you rarely experience these days. The food service is superb, delicious and generous portions. Their full English breakfast just cannot be better. The fruit cups are large and was so much it served as our snacks throughout the day. There is a complementary mini bar which allowed the kids to have drinks throughout the day and night.
The executive lounge is relaxing and the complementary food and drinks are refreshing and delicious. The room is large so everyone has ample space to relax.
The families traveling with kids Bankside is a must. The hotel actually contacted us days prior to arrival to see if our travel party had any special needs. ",5,2023,03,19
120,"Wonderful, fantastic hotel!","The rooms are nice sized. The breakfast you can add is wonderful: omelets, fruit, cereal, eggs, coffee, lattes, juice, toast, pastries, waffles!
The concierge, Jefferson, was fantastic with helping us long before our stay as well as during our stay. Very friendly and professional! Thank you for all your help! ",5,2023,03,18
120,Perfect Experience at Bank Side,The staff in the exec lounge especially Yen was very kind and helpful. She was very helpful whenever we visited the exec lounge. The food was fantastic as well. The catering was great and so was the atmosphere.,5,2023,03,15
120,Best end to end London experience,"Just wonderful end to end  experience at Hilton London Bankside hotel. First the check in process, when very professional lady speaking English and Polish gave us a warm welcome and propose a room that best meets out needs. Then the room itself - modern, stylish, super-clean thanks to best in class housekeeping service, then the club lounge where Sajishma and Abi made us feel special and welcomed. It’s so far - best hotel experience in London.",5,2023,03,13
120,Another great stay.,"Checkout always great. A little glass of fizz is such a nice touch.
Hotel spotless and modern and in a great location.
Bed is one of the comfiest around and the pillows are amazing.
Only slight moan is that the Netflix didn't work and there were no movies.",5,2023,03,13
120,A hidden Gem!,"We've just come back from an amazing stay at Hilton London Bankside and it really is a hidden gem! 

We had bit of a walk from the tube (largely because we came from another Hilton in London so was unsure which tube was best) but as we walked in we were pleasantly greeted by a member of the team who asked to take our bags and offered us a welcome glass of prosecco! What a great way to greet your guests!

Also, worth noting the scent used in the lobby was really nice and the whole place had a great vibe to it. When checking in I was told that we had been upgraded, which is always nice, and shown where the executive lounge was and also the dinning room for breakfast.

The room was beautiful, massive comfy bed and a complimentary mini bar...whats not to like about that!

The GM also emailed me to welcome us to the hotel which I thought was very kind and courteous, not something I generally get when staying in hotels.

Breakfast was amazing, omelettes and eggs cooked to order and plenty of choice for you to fill up ready for the day ahead. The breakfast area was really trendy and well decorated and I can see why it appeals for an evening meal as well.

On our way out we came across a sweet trolley, little cones to fill with a mixture of sweets to choose from, little touches like this really do make a difference.

We did enjoy the exec lounge, spacious, comfortable and plenty of food and drink available. The staff were very attentive and enjoyed looking after the guests, in fact all of the staff where the same... something I haven't found very often in London hotels.

Sadly we didn't get time to enjoy the swimming pool but other guests we spoke to said it was amazing, maybe next time!

We checked out and left out bags, came back for them at 5pm and as we had some time to kill before heading home, I asked if we could go back into the exec lounge to relax? A quick look at our booking and we were allowed back in! Again the little things make the experience so good, a quick coffee and it was time to leave.

A great stay and one I would recommend without hesitation. The staff were welcoming, professional and looked really trendy in their uniform/ dress code. The decor was modern, clean and very relaxing. The rooms, spacious, comfy and had everything you would want.

Oh and the location....perfect! So close to Borough Market and right behind the Tate so pretty central to go anywhere!

Thank you to all the team for making our stay memorable, we will be back and I have already shared how amazing this hotel is with so many people!",5,2023,03,12
120,In the heart of London,"I like the sawtooth very much it’s located very center of London. It’s very close to the bridge. Also, very close to underground. There’s a lot of places you can just arrive by walking hotel rooms are very big enough place very clean all staff very kind, smiling and helping you so I had a very few days in this hotel.",5,2023,03,11
120,Excellent service!,"We have been spending a few days in Hilton, and we have been looked after incredibly well by Yen in the executive lounge!

Such a dedicated service cannot be seen everywhere around hotels - friendly, polite, dedicated. Thank you!",5,2023,03,09
120,Mr,"Kind hotel service goes above and beyond basic hospitality by providing genuine care, empathy and understanding to guests. From a warm greeting to personalized recommendations, it creates a welcoming atmosphere that makes guests feel valued and appreciated. Small gestures like offering complimentary refreshments or a simple note of appreciation can make a big difference in creating a positive experience. Kind hotel service ensures that guests feel comfortable, happy and eager to return",5,2023,03,09
120,Exec lounge,"Really nice calm place. Good food and drink selection. Really well looked after by lady called Yen. She was brilliant. Very helpful and looked after us! Great hotel too, need to do min 200 characters apparently so once again Yen was brilliant",5,2023,03,09
120,Great experience!,Yen was amazing! Great host and very friendly in the executive lounge.  I would heartily recommend! The selection of food and drink is very good and Yen was great. I will certainly be returning in the near future. ,5,2023,03,09
120,"Great quality for a business stay - but not for a holiday or a romantic getaway, ","Room was very modern except for the aircon.,.. which had a mind of it's own...
Only one small window into an internal courtyard  - which was fine for a business. Location isn't great. OK for business but wouldn't stay here for a holiday - middle of highrises/nowhere. That said, no more than 5mins from a tube station so works if the price is right.
I am a gold member - and usually get an upgrade/access to the exec lounge nothing at this place.",3,2023,03,08
120,Hilton Bankside Excellent,"Just siento 2 days at Hilton Bankside..Great hotel a really well traineras and friendly staff.
Thanks especially to Joseph and Ewelina for making our Stay special.
Small issues such as low Lighting and lack of ladies make up desk were not a deal breaker",5,2023,03,07
120,"Huge huge thanks for each one of Hilton staff, but a special gratitude for John Kortenray","We were staying in Hilton 5 days and every time John showed how passion he is about his job and kids, he surprised our daughter with little presents and very kind attitude 😍

It was a huge pleasure to see the person like him every morning greeting us, making this special warm vibes!

Thank you again dear John, hopefully we will be back!",5,2023,03,07
120,Excellent hotel,"From being greeted at the hotel, to the staff at reception - everyone was very welcoming and this is one of the best Hilton’s I have stayed in! The bed was extremely comfortable which is hard to find sometimes with hotels.
Will be returning for sure ",5,2023,03,06
120,Disappointed of breakfast,"Firstly,  want to say big thank you for Mr John at reception,  for made my little boy's stay unforgettable  ❤️ he loves the foxy and the cup too 🫠 extremely welcome hotel with all touch up details in place.  Prosecco at check in was lovely.  Just £50 deposit was surprised me, and would be great,  that hotel would mention it in booking platform,  as people get confused about it. 
The room was spotless and lovely touches to my boy as a gift bag , foxy blanket and cushion too 😊 the room was spacious and pillows was perfectly soft 👌 complimentary mini bar was great, with some snacks and non alcohol drinks too . The robe and slippers was fit perfectly for my boy too. 
Pool was warm and relaxing. Didn't found sauna or steam room, but it didn't mentioned in hotel description.  
The executive lounge is quiet and relaxing, with fire place. They have some fruits, nuts , coffee, juices and fizzy drinks. Some hot evening meals from 6pm , and alcohol drinks too.
I did expected more choices at breakfast time. I was a little bit surprised,  that didn't found more choices of fresh fruits, like watermelon or mango, and not a big choices for international kitchen.  We did had pancakes with chocolate cream , but didn't found crepe or waffles.  And fresh vegetables just hided in the corner... my boy loves milkshakes,  but we didn't found it too...
The great hotel in very good location,  with amazing stuff , but could do more improvement for breakfast  🤗",4,2023,03,05
120,Poor breakfast in a five start hotel,"The hotel is pleasant and the staff is polite and forthcoming. However, we were surprised by the substandard breakfast. The poor rating given here is really because of the breakfast, as everything else was OK. But (!), the breakfast was really unsatisfactory and, in fact, unacceptable for a Hilton hotel that claims to be a five stars operation.

First of all, the bread was absolutely stale. Bread is very a very important aspect of any breakfast for both me and my wife and the bread served at the hotel was minimum 3-4 days old, completely stale, and, in fact, inedible. The croissants and toasts were at the same level, so they did not provide any remedy. 

The problem was that everything was a little bit of the same level. The juices were rather boring and made out of concentrate, the pancake mix was too dilute, leaving the pancakes soggy in the middle, the Bircher muesli was inedible, etc. Fortunately, tea was OK, fruits were OK, and some of the cereals were OK. However, since this hotel is really quite pricey and the breakfast is not included in the price, one would expect that the breakfast would be a special event, something to look forward to. In my books, a Hilton breakfast should be something stellar but this was clearly not. 

I am a Hilton member and have Hilton hotels high on my priority list when looking for hotels wherever I go. However, this hotel I would hesitate to come back to this one as for me, breakfast is an important aspect of my stay. 

Still thanks to the friendly personnel and especially two of the concierges that were really helpful and knowledgeable and helped us find one of the most spectacular Indian restaurants we have ever visited. 

The fox theme was cute and nice!
",2,2023,03,05
120,Brilliant stay,"Lovely stay at the Hilton. The staff are all amazing and so lovely. We got a free welcome glass of Prosecco which was a lovely touch. The beds are so comfy, the pool is great, breakfast was delicious - we’ll definitely stay again! Shout out to Sayyad too.",5,2023,03,04
120,A really fun family stay at a quality hotel,"When we arrived in the lobby we were greeted by a jovial, warm concierge team, a free sweet cart and the smell of essential oils, we relaxed immediately. Everyone relaxed immediately.

The hotel is pristine and the decor is high quality. We had connecting rooms and our two boys (6 & 12) loved having their own bathroom and tv even when we were just in the next room. 

The pool, restaurant and the executive lounge are all great, we especially enjoyed a couple of free drinks and small plates in the exec lounge, it’s really high quality.

Nothing seemed too much for this hotel and on checking out, the boys were given Fox teddies to n keeping with a Fox theme story you’ll need to uncover to understand.

The hotel is within nice walking distance of everything you would want to see on the Southbank and we would recommend walking everywhere to really enjoy the area

Really a magic stay, faultless. Thank you so much, it made our weekend",5,2023,03,04
120,A good place to have your holiday,Good service and wars a great time here. Got helped if needed and it was realy relaxing to be here. Again realy good service from everyboddy. The hotel looks realy beutiful. This is one of the few good looking and good quality hotells i have been in,5,2023,03,01
120,Exceptional,"We walked into this hotel after having fled from another hotel where the room did not match the description on booking.com and we were very rudely dismissed by the hotel reception staff.
The moment we were greeted and made feel welcome by Alessandra at the Hilton Bankside everything changed. What had begun as a nightmare at the hotel we had originally booked, turned into one of our most enjoyable hotel experiences in London to date.
Aside from the friendly, patient, compassionate, caring, and professional staff, the room was bigger than most you can find in London in this category, the swimming pool was surprisingly big, and the hotel restaurant and bar ware also very enjoyable. Last but not least, a great location on the South Bank.",5,2023,03,01
120,Very comfortable and modern hotel,"The hotel was very clean and modern, the room spacious and had a separate workspace. The hotel has a small gym and nice pool area. The staff are very professional and friendly, especially Yen in the executive lounge. Very central location with easy access to multiple underground stations. Will be back. Thanks",4,2023,03,01
120,Flawless,"I only had a one night stay here due to overnighting for an onward flight the following day, however, as with previous stays, everything was on point.

The executive room was spotless and staff in the exec lounge worked hard during the evening 'happy hour'.

Breakfast in Oxbo retaurant was very good which was 'burned off' by the easy walk over the Thames to see the sights of the city.

I feel the hotel represents great value due to its location and accessibility to the main attractions of London which are in walking distance or there is the tube within a short walk to visit locations further afield.

An excellent stay and the Hilton Bankside is now my 'go to' hotel when visiting or transiting through the Capital.",5,2023,03,01
120,Great family stay In London,"We just returned from a great stay at the Hilton  London Bankside! We had a family suite and the kids loved the fox theme. Beds were very comfortable and the kids enjoyed the sodas and cookies that were even refilled during the stay. Breakfast (included with our HHonors level) was delicious with a great variety.  Kids enjoyed the pool as well. Staff was friendly.

I was a bit wary of the location at first and debated staying closer to more touristy areas but it really was perfect for us. We walked to the Tate Modern, Borough Market, Waterloo, London Eye etc and used the Southwark and Blackfriars underground stations the most. There’s also a ferry stop behind the Tate. Tons of restaurants and a smaller M&S, bakeries,  convenience stores, etc as well! 

My only minor issue was I had an accessible bathroom on the king size bed side of the family suite. The bathroom was a completely open room so the entire floor got wet and there were no hooks or shelves. Anything you needed dry had to be on the counter by the sink. I selected this room myself but would have chosen a different one had I known - (rooms 602/604). But very minor and overall loved the room!

Don’t hesitate to book here- especially if need a family sized room as it was a great deal in comparison to other hotels in this category!",5,2023,02,27
120,Great breakfast service,"The service at Hotel Bankside was exceptional, especially a waitress named Abi Baby who was fantastic and quite literally made our day. She was extremely attentive and was the highlight of our breakfast",5,2023,02,26
120,Fantastic stay with family,"Great hotel, fantastic breakfast, staff helps you with everything and doorman Daniel  is always there for a chat or a prosecco when you arrive at the hotel , super!! Next time in london we come back for sure to Hilton bankside",5,2023,02,25
120,Favourite hotel in London,"I’ve been staying in this hotel since it opened in Nov-15. This is the first time I’ve reviewed despite c. 15 stays. I visit with my daughter, who was 8 when first stayed, and occasionally family. It’s my daughters favourite hotel in London and we visit a lot. The hotel is still relatively new so clean and not run down and it’s a superb location if want to be near Southbank and Borough Market. What makes it great for us though is the staff team. I dislike forced hospitality when it’s obvious the questions you’re asked are scripted without any thought. The staff team at Bankside are superb, friendly, welcoming and helpful without being patronising. I usually travel with my daughter and the flexibility in engagement with children is great and the best I’ve had in any hotel I’ve stayed in. Over the past 8 years I’ve only ever had one complaint which I raised straight away but I’ve never given a review. My recent stay was great and Daniel the doorman needs praise. From arrival and through our stay he welcomed and recognised us when we’d been out and come back. Hilton Bankside has been my daughters favourite hotel since 2015 and she said after this stay it’s even better than we last visited in August 2022",5,2023,02,24
120,Daniel Hilton Doorman,"Daniel is an excellent person and has always been welcoming and involved with Hilton’s guests as well as their safety and assisting at a moments notice.

I look forward to being a guest with Hilton again in the future and to be pleasantly greeted by him.",5,2023,02,24
120,"Lovely hotel, great staff, good location","This is a real gem of a hotel, just behind Tate Modern on London's Southbank. The staff were welcoming, efficient and  friendly in a very natural way.
Location is 5 mins walk from Tate Modern and tucked away.
Room was spacious, very clean and a huge comfortable bed.
After a busy day of exploring we really appreciated the pool - a real bonus.
Didn't eat in or use the bar so cannot comment.
Overall, great service and happy to recommend you stay here.
",5,2023,02,23
120,Excellent location and wonderful staff,"The location is really good, loads of restaurants, cafes, well connected to the public transport.

And what a great staff! The service is impeccable, super friendly and welcoming. 

Specifically to Daniel Doorman 100% friendly from the beginning, made our stay amazing",5,2023,02,23
120,"Fantastic hotel, wonderful staff","The hotel always delivers a high quality, friendly and comfortable service. Cannot rate the hotel highly enough. Was welcomed warmly as a diamond member, executive lounge and breakfast were wonderful....I will be back.",5,2023,02,22
120,Great hotel,"Great family suite, on the expensive side as we paid close to $700. Very large room great breakfast. Staff are attentive and they had ges for my children. The suite was one king size bed and pull out sofa that two kids slept on. Shower was great. Check in was a breeze and you are 10 minutes walk from the tube",5,2023,02,22
120,Fabulous Family Holiday,"The reception was friendly and checking in and out was quick and easy. The concierge was always very helpful. 
Rooms are modern and comfortable with all the amenities you would expect from a Hilton.

Breakfast had a good variety and the omelettes and waffles were delicious.

The location is excellent with tube station not far away. There are many supermarkets and restaurants in walking distance. 

We had a great stay and would stay here again.",5,2023,02,21
120,A perfect stay at The Hilton.,"I booked this particular Hilton as a treat for my daughter for her birthday. We wanted to visit London and go to Tate Modern and Somerset House, and I figured instead of rushing back on a train home, let's make a mini-break of it and have some fun. I like staying at Hiltons because they always make you feel special and I like hotels with a pool. 

This location is perfect for Tate Modern and South Bank, and a 25/ 30 minute walk to Somerset House, Covent Garden and the theatre district.

We arrived to a very warm welcome from the door and reception staff. The reception is very stylish, and you can clearly see where the restaurant and bar is. Throughout the hotel are foxes (decorative, not real!), and I won't ruin the story for you, so you'll have to ask someone there for the story of the foxes. We settled in our room which was again very stylish and clean, and we oohed and ahhed over the fluffy bathrobes and slippers. We had fun ticking off all our amenities- (there's the kettle, there's a fridge, there's the hairdryer) and using the lovely toiletries.

The pool stays open till 10 pm, which meant we had enough time to hit the town, see some art, have a meal and have a relaxing swim before hitting the bar for cocktails! The pool is lovely and warm, with a connected spa. I was a bit disappointed that the spa wasn't separate, as I like a hot tub, but it was still relaxing and didn't affect my stay. When we returned to our room, we found out sheets had been turned down and there were cotton rectangles - like pillowcases- next to the bed, with our slippers on top. They say Good Night and Good Morning on them, so must be so your feet don't touch the carpet. We felt like we reached a new level of fancy! The bar is very relaxing and by this time, we really felt like we were on holiday somewhere far away without a care in the world.

The shower was very nice with 5 settings, and the water didn't go all over the place on the floor. Everything was well stocked- soaps, shampoos, lotion. The hand soap was really nice, very moisturizing.

The next morning after another swim we went to the breakfast buffet and the amazing selection of hot food, pastries, cereals...I don't think there was one thing we could have wanted that wasn't available. There was still a bit of sightseeing we wanted to do, so we left our bags behind after checking out and went for a stroll. Each staff member we encountered during our stay was so friendly and we really were able to relax and forget our worries for a day.

I can't wait to plan my next visit- I can see this becoming a tradition Mother/Daughter thing.

Thanks again to all the staff for a wonderful stay.",5,2023,02,20
120,Can't go wrong....,"Just returned from a weekend London break at the Hilton Bankside. Short walk from Southwark underground, easy check in , all staff welcoming and polite. Room 114 was very clean perfect size for a couple with a comfy bed and black out curtains. View of an ai-con unit didn't spoil the room experience.

120,A fabulous lunch with friends ,"Another fantastic bottomless brunch with my friends at OXBO. Excellent service from our waitress Jagruti 🌟 who kept us topped up constantly. Amazing food selection, ambience and we weren't rushed to leave the table despite going over our times slot.  Keep up the great work!!",5,2023,02,19

120,Excellent! ,"Extremely comfortable stay at Hilton Bankside, London. Very comfortable beds, lovely bed linen, large soft white towels. Immaculately clean bedroom. Loads of delicious options at breakfast. Delicious evening meal. Friendly, attentive staff. Little extra touches made stay - daily sweet trolley for the kids, kids' entertainment packs. Old - fashioned hospitality! Hotel well located for touring the sights. Great stay! ",5,2023,02,17
120,Fantastic hotel in an excellent location,"Amazing hotel, staff, food.  Simply perfect.  Location is far enough from the hustle and bustle and yet close enough to be very central to ever main tourist attraction of London, whether it be a walk, public transport or the fantastic black cabs.  ",5,2023,02,17
120,Lovely service,"Can’t recommend this hotel enough. The concierge was amazing, he helped us so much. Also, Yen, Sofia and Melania provided excellent service in the Executive Lounge, so helpful and welcoming. If you are coming to London, this is the place to stay.",5,2023,02,16
120,Outstanding,"My experience is always based around the service I receive from the team when I visit, in particular, Sofia Yen.
She always greets me with a smile, nothing is ever too much trouble and she is warm, caring and attentive.
Hospitality when delivered well, can make amends for the worst of days at the office - when I visit the hotel, Sofia and her colleagues always go out of the way to make sure that hospitality and attentiveness is at the forefront of their minds.
To the Exec Lounge team - I thank you very much, the experience and service you provide, is second to none I have experienced in London",5,2023,02,16
120,Superb.,"Our family room was clean, comfortable and perfect. The staff were all very friendly and nothing was too much trouble. Room service was delicious and speedy. We’ll definitely be back. The hotel is beautifully decorated and has the wow factor when you arrive. ",5,2023,02,15
120,Hotel is nothing special and I was over charged despite assurances it wouldn't happen,"I booked a stay for 3 nights and then modified it online to 4 nights. A check before travelling revealed that there were 2 separate bookings. I called the hotel and was told the first booking was now cancelled and not to worry, no charges would be made. On check-in, I again was assured that the first booking was cancelled and no charge would be made except for the 4 nights of the planned stay. On my return, I was surprised to see that I had been charged 270 euros extra. The Guest Relations Manager informed me by email that this was a cancellation charge. A second email to them was left unanswered. 
I see now that there are several similar cases in the 1 star reviews. I should have read the 1 and 2 star reviews before booking and I suggest that everyone does the same. Don't expect any come-back if you have complaints.
In addition, I booked a room with lounge access as the website says it offers breakfast. This was confirmed on check-in. However, the morning after, on entering the lounge I was told that breakfast is only served at the weekends. We had to go outside and pay for breakfast on 2 of the days we were there. What a con! 
The rooms are average. Our bath had a small black hole in the enamel and the shower gel holder fell off the wall. 
I have the choice of staying in Hilton Hotels for my work this year, I have had pleasure in changing our bookings for a different brand.",1,2023,02,13
120,Great Location and value for money,"A lovely little hotel as part of the Hilton chain. But this one is abit extraordinary with its small boutique feel to it. Great service, great location (to the Tate, cross the bridge and hey presto, you’re in the City!) and plenty of local cafes, pubs and convenience stores nearby. ",5,2023,02,11
120,Excelente service as expected from the Hilton,"We stayed at the hotel and taken breakfast two times. The service offered by Sayyad Eddeen was amazing. He was professional, kind and helped us any time. The options you have for breakfast are varied, and you can also ask for omelette and pancake in the moment. Excellent, as expected from the Hilton.",5,2023,02,11
120,"Bankside Hiton, London","We were very satisfied with the hotel. Spacious rooms with amazing room service and delicious food. The staff was very friendly and kind. The hotel is situated in the center, making it good and easy to get to all the main attractions.",5,2023,02,09

120,"Great location, friendly staff","From the welcome on arrival from the door person to departing we couldn't have felt more welcome. We have stayed a few times at the hotel and it never disappoints.
The check in was perfect as were all the staff throughout our stay. There was a young lady in the Executive Lounge called Younas who said she was only a temp but she couldn't have done anymore to assist. I would definitely give her a full time job, the industry need staff like her. Breakfast as always was a typical Hilton breakfast, plenty of choice & cooked fresh.
We will certainly return as soon as we can",5,2023,02,03
120,Great spot in London!,"We went to London for a business/leisure vacation, we stayed at the Hilton Bankside and it certainly did not disappoint!  It was absolutely lovely!

The breakfast buffet was delicious, the bar was beautiful and again all the staff working there were very pleasant and eager to help.  We will definitely go back!",5,2023,02,02
120,Excellent hotel.,"We stayed at the Hilton Bankside for 8 nights including new years eve 2022 / 2023.

As diamond hhonors we had access to the executive lounge which was excellent for breakfast, snacks and evening drinks
Service at the hotel was excellent also. The room was very spacious.",5,2023,01,31
120,Done Done London,"Amazing service. Very cordial staff. I must say Mr. Daniel Doormen is a gem of person, really know how to treat People well. 
I would say best place to stay in central London
Breakfast spread and Room service too is very good.
Only one downside, I wish the lighting could have been more ambient in the room..",5,2023,01,31
120,Brilliant time at a very pleasant hotel,"Really enjoyable stay
I stayed here for one night to celebrate my partners birthday and I wanted it to be special so booked and executive room with lounge access. We were greeted with a glass of Prosecco in the attractive foyer. 
Our room was ready on arrival and we were given keys early which was welcome. As it’s was my partners birthday a welcome plate was in the room. The room had a bathtub as I requested and was very clean. The bed was large and comfortable 
We took advantage of the lounge facilities. Do not eat prior to the canapés you will regret it as we did and could barely eat anything in the lounge. We will be back to rectify that mistake 😂😂 
There was great food and a good selection of drinks on offer and the staff were very polite and helpful. Everything was clean and efficient all the staff were polite and helpful and seemed quite happy which is nice. The pool and gum looked good but we didn’t use those. The breakfast again did not disappoint all in all a very enjoyable stay we will definitely be back at Bankside",5,2023,01,30
120,Brilliant brunch ,"Terence was fantastic. Very attentive and helpful. The food was so nice. Unlimited starters, open kitchen and desserts plus mains. Great price and great atmosphere!! Unlimited bubbles with a fruit stations. Sooooo good! ",5,2023,01,29
120,Perfect stay,"Perfect stay. From the welcome, to the food  and  the facilities on offer this was the perfect hotel.  Close to central London and the usual sights this hotel is just ideal.  The cocktails and nibbles in the Distillery bar were amazing and after a night out watching a show we slept like a log. The beds were so comfortable and the shower wonderful. Cleaning was second to none and the breakfast the best we’ve had. Overall, a faultless stay and a perfect weekend to remember.",5,2023,01,29
120,Another lovely stay at the Hilton London Bankside,"I’m a regular visitor here – this property has been one of my favourites anywhere in the world for a long time. They certainly didn’t disappoint on my latest visit. The staff are always attentive and friendly. (Special shout out here to Alessandra at reception for her care and attention to detail.) the decor and ambience of the hotel are also first-rate. I was given access to the executive lounge on my stay, which was a nice touch. The evening social with food and drink was most enjoyable. I wouldn’t hesitate to come back here.",5,2023,01,29
120,Brilliant ,"What can I say ,  we checked in on Saturday 28th January and stayed for 1 night , from the minute we walked into the Hotel it was amazing service, reception staff brilliant, our room was brilliant and clean , I couldn’t fault it even though I tried , was out for the day but came back on the night  and had a drink in the bar , once again , good service , next morning came down for breakfast which I would highly recommend, you name it , they had it   and again service good , we are definitely coming back , Joseph waved us off goodbye and recommended a nice walk by the river which we did . ",5,2023,01,29
120,Excellent Hotel in a Cool Area,"We had a superb stay at the London Hilton Bankside.  The Hotel is modern and the staff are friendly, professional and very helpful.  We stayed for a week and greatly enjoyed the variety of breakfast choices in the main restaurant.   Everything was fresh and tasty from pastries to freshly cooked pancakes and omelets.  They had two Latte machines where you could select about 12 different types of coffee drinks.  

Our room was updated with a modern bathroom that had a glass shower with two shower heads, overall nice mood lighting, and the usual firm Hilton bed.  BTW:  For any of my American travelers, ask for help with lights in the room.  There is a master switch with card entry that should be pulled when leaving so as not to waste energy (typical in Europe).  Also, there are various switches to ensure your charging plugs stay on at night - you just need to test them with the master room switch.  There are two USB chargers on each side of bed - so you don't even need US to Britain adaptors.  

We loved the Diamond Executive Lounge.  They were open around 6 am to 10 pm with sodas, water, and a latte machine available available  But, from 6-8 in the evening, they have at least one hot vegetarian and one meat dish, cheeses, breads, desserts, and complimentary beer, wine, mixed drinks, sodas etc.  We were jet lagged and made this our dinner stop the first two nights. There was a lot of seating, fireplace, etc, that combined one of the best exec lounges for a Hilton. Several other reviewers said this was better than the St. James Hilton. 

The location is a five minute walk to the Southwark Tube station, one block from the Tate and a few blocks to the Globe Theater.  You can take the Millennium Bridge on the riverside of the Tate - directly across the Thames to St. Paul's Cathedral.  The London Bridge and amazing Borough Market are about a 15 minute walk.  There are  great pubs and restaurants in the area.  The Bankside is a cool area all the way around without the crazy rush of central London tourist areas.",5,2023,01,28
120,More like this pls Hilton 👌,"Felt very different to any other Hilton we’ve stayed in. Modern, cool, comfortable & great price for a weekend night. Got upgraded with Gold honours - view across the river to St Paul’s. Breakfast was excellent, especially the 2 chefs - omelette made with care & fresh waffles were best I’ve ever had 👌 

More properties like this pls Hilton..",5,2023,01,28
120,Birthday Brunch,What a great brunch it was ! Sam Singh and Alkesh were very attentive. Lots of delicious food and fizz! Also a great atmostphere with live music throughout the two hour slot. Definitely worth a visit.,5,2023,01,28
120,The best stay in London!,"This hotel really knows how to deliver exceptional service. It’s our third time and the high standard just gets even better and better.

From the welcome at the door by the wonderful Joseph, through to check in, drinks, executive club and breakfast, everything was done to the highest standard.

Alessandra at reception was so friendly, professional, and helpful, a true asset. 

The lighting and comfort in this hotel is just perfect, and our exec room was comfortable with everything you could want (the rain shower is something else, too!).

I can’t see how you could fail to be impressed here.",5,2023,01,28
120,Fabulous Hotel in London !,"I cannot compliment this hotel enough. Absolutely nothing is too much trouble. From the welcoming email from the GM, James Clarke to the welcome from the front of house staff and reception, it really does epitomise the service level staff at all ‘excellent hotels’ should strive for! I love the rooms and as a Diamond guest I was upgraded to a Executive Room (rm 658), which is a lovely size room and extremely well appointed. We ate in the restaurant and had a really great meal. Staff helped us with taxis and holding luggage for us, with swift and friendly customer service. This really is my #1 hotel in London, and I cannot wait to return!",5,2023,01,27
120,Recommend to anyone,"Stayed here last week for a couple of days and was very impressed its a lovely place we had a  gorgeous room with  fantastic bathroom without doubt best we have had in London for the money, the bar area was inviting which is nice as some hotels they can be a bit  soulless, got a warm welcome from Daniel on the front door upon arrival which always sets things off in the right way a credit to the hotel, would definitely recommend this place to anyone and the swimming pool just seals it ! ",5,2023,01,25
120,Long Weekend,"This is our second time staying at this hotel. 
Everything about this hotel is excellent. 

The location, accommodation, breakfast, pool and most importantly the staff. 

I was really looking forward to my stay here and was not disappointed. 
I love the friendly staff and the ambiance about this hotel. 

The pool is very nice, clean & bright. Breakfast is fit for for a King or Queen. 
Beds are super comfy and the rooms are quiet. 

If you want to see London the location ( beside Tate Modern ) is ideal. In my case a flight to London Gatwick and a short train journey takes you to Blackfriars Station which is a short walk to the Hotel. 

Don’t wait around book that trip and stay here!",5,2023,01,24
120,Top me up!,"Amazing service, I don’t think I saw the bottom of my glass ever! No need to request anymore bubbles they just kept a close eye on when a top up was needed. Very attentive. Thank you Alpesh & Sam Singh for waiting on us. Made today’s surprise treat for my husband especially special. Food was delish too.",5,2023,01,22
120,Fabulous stay at Hilton London Bankside!,"Awesome amenities, location and staff. Chrissa ensured we had a room that made the extended stay absolutely wonderful, especially with the view to the Shard!! We loved it and wIll definitely be back!!",5,2023,01,21
120,Outstanding,"I have to start by saying many thanks to front desk manager Natasha B for making our 3rd trip to Hilton London Bankside very special for us. The staff was great, the room was immaculate , also the breakfast buffet was plentiful. The location is very convenient, very close to London Bridge and the Tower of London, and the subway takes about ten minutes to walk.",5,2023,01,19
120,Best spot for business travel,This is my go to spot when I travel for business. The location is perfect for talking around the bankside/st Paul’s area and the staff is super friendly. The lounge is generous in their food and drink offerings in the evening. The staff in the lounge is also extremely helpful. Yen and Sofia were extremely kind and attentive.,5,2023,01,19
120,The best Hilton in London for business or family,"We’ve had the most amazing stay and feel spoiled rotten. Not only is this the best location in London… but the amenities for kids, like the fox scavenger hunt and really… every experience here has been utterly incredible. My hat is off to the team here at the Hilton in Bankside. From check-in with Natasha… to our new friend Alessandra, we are fully enamored. And do please visit Jamie & Amy at the spa… they are worth all your quid.",5,2023,01,18

On this trip, I reached Heathrow really early at 10am and called ahead.  Alessandra assured me she'd have a room ready in less than an hour; and then greeted me at check in on arrival and couldn't have been more helpful.   Really pleasant stay.",5,2023,01,16
120,The best bottomless brunch!,We had the best bottomless brunch ever! We were served by Younas who couldn’t have looked after us better! She was so thoughtful and caring.  The whole experience was perfect - delicious food and our fizz was topped up throughout the meal.  We will be back! ,5,2023,01,16
120,The amazing Daniel the Doorman,Thé best hotel welcome I’ve had In London from Daniel The Doorman. He went above and beyond to make me feel welcome and looked after the entire stay. Everyone in the hotel was generally great but Daniel the doorman made all of the days I stayed amazing,5,2023,01,15
120,Lovely stay  for 50th celebration,"Lovely hotel very friendly, Daniel the doorman was amazing, complementary , Prosecco on arrival, also taking photos for us. Breakfast amazing!  Pool lovely, good location. 

Celebration package good value ",5,2023,01,15
120,"A reliable, professional, clean and modern refuge for any type of traveler","We had a wonderful three night stay at the Hilton London Bankside over Christmas weekend after spending our first night at a smaller boutique Hilton Curio in South Kensington. This truly is a 5-star hotel based on the scope of amenities and services offered and professionalism rendered.

All of the staff members, from the front desk to the hosts to breakfast and happy hour personnel, were focused and professional. The entire hotel was new, modern and clean. The lobby area was large and never felt too crowded; in fact, no portion of the hotel felt congested despite the busy holiday week.

We stayed in the Family suite with two connecting bedrooms and baths (one with a King bed and the other with two twin beds). They were spacious with comfortable mattress beds and bathrooms with large showers. The décor of the room had more of a convention/conference hotel feel to make it consistent with the Hilton brand but still felt bright with the light-color wood paneling and lots of storage space – cabinets and large closets which combined with the room layout and tables accommodated several suitcases. The windows faced a narrow enclosed walkway and views looking into other rooms which meant little direct sunlight but also meant absolutely no street noise and a completely quiet sleep – something I doubt you find in the majority of central London hotels. Oh, the entrance to bath tub was a bit high but the tub itself was large and the thick bath towers and bath robe to follow very comfortable.

The kids had used the pool one in the lower level one evening after sightseeing and the fitness center and locker room clean and well-equipped. One small suggestion is to increase the temperature level in the pool and adjacent “hot tub” as is still slightly cold.

The breakfast buffet was served in a large spacious room with tables spread over various sections which again never felt crowded. The buffet had plenty of diverse options and never seemed to run out. The cooks preparing the fresh made to order omelets and waffles were friendly, and accompanied daily with hot porridge, chicken sausage, bacon and scrambled eggs, and a cold cheese and vegetable bar and various breads. I suppose my only complaint was that the coffee from the espresso/cappuccino machine tasted terrible – something I experienced throughout London.  

Additionally, the Executive lounge available to Bonvoy members of certain status or perks was convenient, well-stocked (containing waters, sodas and coffee all days), large and comfortable with a charming fireplace in the center and again multiple seating areas. The nightly happy hour selections from 5-7pm were not top shelf but hot and cold food and drinks generous and service attentive. The happy hour was a quick energizer for us before heading out for the night for a more festive extended dinner and more but we did notice how some guests staying in for the night were quite content with making that their happy hour dinner (I don’t blame them). Ultimately, the breakfast combined with the Executive lounge meant that you were always taken care of and had access to basic necessities.  

Joseph at front was helpful with luggage when checking in when the staff was out.  On our last morning we finally had the pleasure of meeting the famous Daniel and John, who were friendly and charming and espoused their dedication to their work. Daniel helped us with our luggage and taxi as we departed.

Personally, I felt that the Bankside location was perfect – it was quieter with less traffic than the central more touristic areas in the north side of the river yet close enough to walk or take a short cab to wherever you would like to go. We liked it especially for the close walks in either direction among the Thames (bridge hopping).  The location also offers more modern and well-maintained amenities you may not get as easily (or at such a reasonable price) in the older more crowded tourist spots. Yes, the hotel lacks some of the charm you may find in an older building or a boutique but I think is more than made up from the extensive consistent clean and professional services and amenities offered.

Bottomline – this is a great modern, clean and reasonably priced hotel for families on vacation or the business traveler with all the amenities and access you would want with professional attentive service, well deserving of its high TripAdvisor ranking.",5,2023,01,14
120,Executive Lounge,Stayed at the hotel for a number of nights and used the executive lounge in the evening. The lounge was clean and tidy and the staff were really friendly. In particular Yen was really nice. We had a good chat on both nights I had stayed and she regularly cleared the table and brought top up drinks. Would recommend and thank you for a fab experience Yen!,5,2023,01,12
120,Modern hotel in great location with friendly staff,"Highly recommend this modern hotel located within 4 min walk to Southwark Underground Station. The rooms are spacious and with larger sized bathroom. The staff is friendly, and the executive lounge is amazing. The lounge has small bites and wine and spirits. They served beef/vegetable curry and spaghetti for the main course.  The pool area is nice and relaxing with a hot tub feature.",5,2023,01,11
120,Amazing stay,"Amazing stay at this property. First of all I personally loveee the location, so conveniently located nearby Sainsburys, Tesco, Costa, Gail’s Bakery, Paul, Sbucks, Nandos, Blacksheep coffee, even M&S food and some other restaurants around. I love getting my coffee early and to buy snacks, stuffs to bring home, etc early in the morning at shops nearby. I felt it as a privilege to have so many options just 1/2 mins away from the hotel.
Secondly the property is in excellent condition, all rooms are spotless, gym and pool are amazing. We love the indoor pool so much. 
Thirdly the staffs are quick, friendly, welcoming, and helpful as well. Concierge teams are especially excellent in helping us getting taxis, helped with our luggages, weight scale, and book airport taxi due to the strike as well. 
We stayed for Christmas and early Jan after, we love this side of rather quieter London but at the same time, also conveniently  located near so many landmarks like Tate Modern, Millenium bridge, St Paul, and Borough Market.
Underground station is also near, nice view of london eye from Southwark station. It was lovely. After a day at the central London with so many ppl, staying at here to rest with so many food and convenient  store options is a huge blessing. 
We will definitely come back. ",5,2023,01,11
120,Great hotel,"Beautiful and lovely hotel, spotlessly clean and very friendly, helpful staff - we would like to appreciate ANA DARII's service at the restaurant. She was very kind. Great location within walking distance to all the main tourist attractions in the city.

It seemed as if it was newly renovated. The location is excellent, just a few minutes walking distance to the Tate Modern, Millennium Bridge, Borough Market, and Southwark tube station. The staff is helpful and friendly. ",5,2023,01,07
120,London getaway,"Just back from a couple of days in the Hilton Bankside, it’s a wonderful hotel in a great location. The overriding feature is the staff whom are fantastic, from the concierge team to reception and the team in food and beverage, their levels of customer service go over and beyond the normal levels. Our rooms were on the 6th floor and were well appointed well maintained and serviced well by the accommodation team. The Factilities including the swimming pool, executive lounge and bar and restaurant are great. Breakfast had a great selection of hot and cold buffets. Bar food in the evening and lunch time very good 

Overall, great stay thank you",5,2023,01,07

The room was lovely, pool a great addition and breakfast was everything you could ask for . We will definitely be back x",5,2023,01,07
120,Excellent choice,"We recently spent three nights at Hilton Bankside. It is the most well-run and polished property at which we have stayed.  (We travel a lot and are Hilton Diamond members.) 

The property and team is exceptional. Their reservation staff emails were prompt and helpful prior to our arrival. Their front desk reception/ bell/ concierge staff is polite, welcoming, helpful, and knowledgeable. Their breakfast offers a variety of high-quality options. Our family was impressed with our housekeeper’s speed, attention to detail, and ability to do little things to delight. 

The location is convenient. It is a quick 6-minute (.3 miles) walk to Southwark Underground station. There are three grocery/convenience stores and restaurants close by.  The Tate Modern is two blocks away. 

If our schedule permits us to travel again to London, we will definitely stay there again.",5,2023,01,06
120,Amazing hotel with Great staff,"What an amazing hotel , cosy and warm . I loved staying here it was so nice and in a great location behind the Tate modern .

120,A True London Gem ! One of the top Hilton’s Yet.,"A London regular, I have historically always been a sucker for my Earl’s Court area and a fixed hotel since the past 20 years. For the first time for the sake of adventure and variety we chose the Hilton London in the South Bank area and truly I had an unforgettable experience.

It’s a classy hotel, in a classy location but matches up in very polite and courteous staff, superb service, next door supermarket and a lovely Wagamama across the street. The in-house OXBO is a very stylish restaurant to host your friends if they come to visit or if you’d like to dine in. We thoroughly enjoyed the lavish breakfast spread and being Hilton honour members and going the extra mile with  a suite we weee pampered with superb lounge services hi tea, snacks, evening beverages etc.

Jefferson at the concierge is a gem and truly very helpful and efficient. James and Rahul are great managers and someday would make great progress in their respective fields we hope. The chef Mr Ali Shariff is not just a great chef but a superb individual and will leave no stone unturned to make sure you are well fed and taken care of in his restaurant.

Our room a suite and the entire hotel done up very chic and modern very stylish, we absolutely loved it. Everything is at walking distance and the area is really pretty. We had the pleasure of bumping into the CEO of the hospitality group that owns the hotel and the sheer humility this man oozes out is contagious and we believe is a part of each and every staff here. 

We did not get a chance to utilise the wonderfully heated indoor pool or the state of the art gym, but they both looked great for guests to use. 

All in all a perfect hotel for leisure, business, couple or family stay. Highly recommended and a guaranteed repeat stay from my side with my entire family hopefully the next time round.

",5,2023,01,04
120,OUR HOME IN LONDON !,"My husband and I love travelling to London from India, however we have always stated in the Earl’s Court area. As much as we love Earl’s Court, Hilton London Bankside, the excellent staff, the amenities, the location l, the lovely interiors have left us elated and definitely warrants another visit while we enjoy our favourite city in the world.

Few noteworthy mentions our lovely breakfast was made even more wonderful with the presence of chef Ali Shariff. Other than being a splendid chef he is also a superb human being and now a great acquaintance. Jefferson at the concierge has made our trip so comfortable we have not been helped so much in London ever. James and Rahul are both wonderful managers and we hope to see them there again soon if they have not already been promoted. 

We loved our room design very modern and chic which was the experience all over the hotel
Including the lobby, the Uber stylish OXBO as well as the lounge for honour guests and the lovely breakfast spread. 

We had a suite room which made our stay even more comfortable and we also had the pleasure of bumping into the CEO of the hospitality group that runs the hotel. He and his family were so humble that we could immediately understand where the humility in the attitude of the staff came from.

All in all if you are in London for any reason be it sightseeing, just leisure or business this is the perfect place, we highly recommend. It is worth the price offered Which we feel is very decent for the kind of service and amenities offered. Supermarket next door and Wagamama across the road were cherry on top in the cold weather.",5,2023,01,04
120,A very special waiter,"We spent 2 nights at the Hilton Bankside over New Year's Eve. The breakfast was excellent, the rooms very clean and the location of the hotel unbeatable. The staff at the front desk was quite unfriendly, you didn't feel like you could go to them with your concerns. The doorman Daniel was incredibly friendly (as the only doorman), the rest of them never greeted or said goodbye to us as they should in a 5 star hotel. We would like to say a very special thank you to the breakfast waiter Abou, who made our whole stay more enjoyable with his friendly, lively and special demeanor every morning.",4,2023,01,03
120,New Years Eve weekend,We had quite the mix up upon check in with our rooms but they fixed the issue - not really the greatest first impression of the hotel. However the lounge was really good and they had a good New Years Eve. Daniel the doorman did a really great job handing out Prosecco and candy to everyone. Good location for fireworks and centrally located.,4,2023,01,02
120,"If Carlsberg did small, convenient hotels…","Wow! What a nice hotel. This was a one night stay to see the New Year’s day parade. The room is exactly as pictured on the website - twin executive with lounge access. It was a very good size, with a generous hallway just before the main room. It was very quiet at night - facing the courtyard. It had a good coffee machine and bathrobes and slippers. Other touches included an umbrella and safe. Despite a large bathroom, our only concern was the bath with an ‘over shower’ that was a bit high to get into - but you can request a walk in shower, apparently. We left our bags with the excellent concierge at mid day and did our bit in London for the day. The staff were really helpful and sent a text to tell us when the room was ready (3pm). We had access to the lounge on our return, which was really relaxing as it is a generally quiet space with a coffee machine and light snacks. The gym is a good size for this kind of hotel and the pool is small but functional. To be honest, it is surprising to have these in a small hotel in London at this price. A complementary light meal was served in the lounge with modest (but acceptable) red, white and sparkling wine (Cava) between 6 and 8 pm. The lounge was buzzing in that period and some took full advantage of the wine and spirits! The breakfast was very generous and had all the usual stations, with fresh eggs and pancakes/waffles. The chefs were very polite and helpful. In fact almost all the staff we came across were exceptionally helpful and friendly. We took full advantage of the 12 pm checkout and, unusually for us, took a couple of hours to enjoy the breakfast spread. The waiting staff looked quite slow and leisurely but, in fact were very efficient. All in all, this hotel punches well above its weight and the staff are their secret weapon! Bravo Hilton - it’s one of your best!",5,2023,01,02
120,Excellent stay!!!,"Excellent stay in this hotel. 

The hotel is in an excellent location and is truly top quality. The staff are all so friendly and can't do enough to help you. The moment we walked in, we were greeted by happy, smiling faces. The food, the atmosphere, and the rooms all are of a very high standard and a must if staying with a family.

",5,2023,01,01
120,Great Service,This is my second time staying at the Hilton London Bankside.  The service is friendly without making you feel uncomfortable.  Shout out to the doorman Daniel who greeted us daily on our travels.  He was always there to offer assistance and was helpful when it was needed.  I will stay here if we travel to London again.,5,2023,01,01
120,Great family hotel,We loved the Hilton Bankside. We stayed with our family and felt at home. The hotel spoiled the kids with welcome gifts and candy. The breakfast buffet is delicious. The doorman named Daniel always went out of his way to help us. Such a nice man.,5,2023,01,01
120,Superb!,"We loved EVERYTHING about our experience at the Hilton Bankside! The lobby was nicely décorated for the holidays and smelled SUPER nice.  The staff was wonderful from our initial arrival to the entire stay.  The room was clean, modern, spacious.",5,2022,12,30
120,Three nights at Hilton Bankside,Service was very good and everyone was really helpful. Location was good and amenities at the hotel were nice. Rooms were comfortable and especially blankets were excellent. The restaurant of the hotel was a bit of disappointment but otherwise everything was fine. Daniel doorman was very thoughtful and fulfilled all our requests. ,5,2022,12,29
120,First night meal at Oxbo,"Gorgeous food, friendly staff, lovely atmosphere.  So well-treated this evening by our server Jagruti at Oxbo. What a pleasure.  Chicken with Jerusalem artichoke was succulent with so many layers of flavor created in the dish. We arrived fairly late and the staff were so gracious.",5,2022,12,27
120,Christmas break,"Fantastic hotel stayed in room 249! special thank you to all the staff who worked over Xmas it was much appreciated special thank and mention to
All the following in the restaurant on Xmas day
Terence, Campbell, Adreil de la serna and Melanie Stojko
I would recommend this special hotel and all the great staff without exception",5,2022,12,27
120,Hilton that exceeds expectations,"Very nice hotel with good sized rooms/bathrooms, great bar and restaurant, friendly staff, wonderful lounge, and convenient location with 5 min walk to Shakespeare's Globe, 7 min to Borough Mkt and 10 min to the Shard. Breakfast and brunch is excellent. We would stay here again. ",5,2022,12,26
120,Perfect place to see London but avoid the crowds,"The hotel itself is well positioned with respect to all Southbank sites (especially Tate Modern, Waterloo, Borough Market and more), but the real selling point is that the hotel is every bit as lovely as any central London hotel with the benefit of being away from the chaos of the West End, Whitehall and other high traffic areas. Yet, you can access all of that energy by jumping on the Tube or walking across the Thames. Win-win! 

The rooms and amenities of the hotel are all in great shape and when you walk into the lobby, there's ALWAYS someone on the staff there to welcome you. I'd be amazed if I was NOT welcomed once when I walked in. 

Rooms are very spacious and modern. The black granite showers are really quite opulent - great water flow. I was not given an upgrade due the hotel being fully booked, but even so, the room was really lovely. Anyone staying there would enjoy any room assigned. 

Breakfast in the lobby level restaurant was also fantastic. The cooked-to-order omelet was large even by American standards and available as an egg white. There was more than enough selection for dietary preferences of any kind. And well displayed, stocked and spaced out enough for an efficient and enjoyable breakfast. 

As a Diamond Member, I had access to the Executive Lounge which is among the best of the Hilton properties in London. Even before my room was ready, the Exec Lounge was made available to me which was a perfect place to work for a few before setting out to see London on foot .I would like to point out that the evening happy hour/canapés are excellent and well-stocked  the entire time the lounge is serving. Terrific selection of beer, wine, alcohol and of course hot and cold foods. Again, one of the top lounges I've had the pleasure of using in London. 

Two final thoughts: 1. While the staff at large was wonderful in the hotel, Yen Xuong Ly and Joseph in the Lounge were terrific. Yen was particularly attentive each night I was there and made me/us enjoy the full lounge experience. We wanted to pass along our appreciation. 2. I STRESS this is not an indictment on the hotel, but one night at the lounge, we patrons were treated to a family of 4 that treated the lounge as an all-you-can-eat buffet, complete with shouting, kids playing tag, the parents completely self-absorbed while the kids pled their plates with food that went uneaten. Patrons were just shocked to see this kind of behavior from all 4 of the family. My only - and I stress MINOR - issue: I would think the hotel might want to ask people who handle themselves in that manor to perhaps go elsewhere. 

Overall, a wonderful hotel for a wonderful visit to London!",5,2022,12,26
120,Lovely Christmas break,"Checked in yesterday to this lovely hotel room 249.  Very comfortable beds.  High standard of housekeeping - lovely bed linen, towels etc.  Very stylish hotel beautifully decorated for Christmas.  Charming staff,  friendly and welcoming check in.  Great quality breakfast - fab head chef and a lovely lady on the eggs  station.  Special mention for Salma Adam at breakfast, and Sam in the bar/exec lounge.  Highly recommend this hotel, great location.  Will definitely stay again.",5,2022,12,24
120,Great Value and Quality for London,"This was our 5th vacation visit to London. In the past we’ve stayed in the Paddington, Mayfair, and Westminster areas of the city. Due to high hotel costs in those areas and our past visit experience we decided to look farther afield. What an excellent find this hotel turned out to be! Quality and room size were excellent and equivalent, or better than, where we had stayed in the past. This hotel was clean, quiet, well kept, and the service was great as expected with a Hilton. 

As far as location we personally enjoyed it due to this being a quieter area of the city yet still an area that was quite safe even at night. That said this hotel is easy walking distance to Borough Market, Southwark Cathedral, and several tube stops. There are some restaurants nearby, so if you are not concerned with a short walk and an extra 2-3 tube stops each day to get to the major attractions, this is an outstanding choice. We loved the location, but are giving the 4 stars because this really isn’t the place to stay if your main goal is to be as close as possible to the main activity and attractions of London. If this is your first or fortieth visit and you’re willing to compromise slightly on location, staying here will give you high quality for a reasonable (per London standards) cost. Really, a couple extra tube stops is well worth it.

We will absolutely look here first next time we are coming to London.",4,2022,12,20
120,Restaurant and bar,"The hotel was perfect for our trip! We wrapped up each action packed day with a nightcap at the bar. Sam was always there with a smile. He took great care of our kids, finding foods they like to eat and the perfect cocktail cow the adults. He was also willing to share travel tips for our trip. ",5,2022,12,20
120,Amazing stay at Bankside - wonderful staff,"I stayed at London Hilton Bankside in mid-December for two nights with my Wife and two young Daughters. What an absolutely fantastic hotel, and simply superb staff who really made the stay special. 

We stayed in a family room which is two rooms joined together - it actually felt like a small apartment and was beautifully appointed. On arrival the girls had beautiful fox pillows, blankets and soft toys on their beds (the fox is hotel mascot) which was a lovely touch.

We used the pool a few times which is in the sub basement and absolutely stunning. The gym (next to the pool) is also very good and has a good range of cardio and resistance machines/free weights.

We ate breakfast at the hotel both mornings and the buffet was superb with a massive selection of self-serve and cook to order options - the kids loved helping themselves. We also ate in the hotels Distillery restaurant both evenings and the food was top drawer - burgers all round which were topped with all of the trimmings and great portions!

We would particularly like to thank Raoul (Management), Sam (Distillery restaurant), Joseph (Welcome), and Kamaal (Front of house) for their superb hospitality and making us all feel special during our stay. You do the hotel chain proud and the level of service you offer really does elevate a great experience to an outstanding one.",5,2022,12,20
120,Long weekend stay during christmas time ,"The staff was really nice and Daniel (the doorman) was always so quick to help. I felt seen and if I looked like I had a bothering thought they came right over to me and asked if I was okay. We got complementary prosecco when we arrived and they offered us candy from the christmas candy bar they had set up. Overall a really great stay, especially in the holidays. ",5,2022,12,20
120,Lovely hotel!,"This is a beautiful hotel with staff who can’t do enough to help. We had a family room which was basically 2 interconnecting rooms and both were spotless, spacious and plush. We had the buffet breakfast included which was lovely with loads of choice. We also really enjoyed the location of this hotel and found all parts of London really accessible from here. I stupidly left some keys in one of the hotel rooms after check out and concierge were kind enough to ship these back to me the same day. Brilliant service, I highly recommend this hotel.",5,2022,12,18
120,Great breakfast,"Sayyad Eddeen looked after us at breakfast on Sunday.  Our first morning as Mr&Mrs! 
Great food selection in a lovely restaurant setting at Hilton Bankside. Christmas decorations were also nice touch with good atmosphere.",5,2022,12,18
120,Perfect,Stunning hotel - the staff are extremely helpful and attentive. Brilliant service and a great variety of food at breakfast. Our waiter Sayyad Eddeen was very welcoming and approachable especially. Definitely recommend!,5,2022,12,18
120,Lovely stay,"We booked this hotel for our anniversary celebration, and it didn’t disappoint. Staff all welcoming, helpful and friendly. The Christmas decorations and little touches like Christmas movies been shown in reception, a delicious festive scent and staff wearing a Christmas jumper are really lovely. The room was really clean, comfortable and spacious, hadn’t expected the turn down service, so after our confusion on finding our slippers laid out we were really impressed with this little detail. We booked the celebration package and were welcomed with balloons, bubbles on ice and a lovely cake with ‘congratulations’ piped with chocolate, really lovely touch. The breakfast was amazing, such a huge range available-including decaf options from the coffee machine, almost impossible to find decaf without hassle. The hotel is located within a few minutes walk of so many of the Southbank’s features, perfect for exploring. We would definitely stay again, thank you",5,2022,12,17
120,A great stay,"I booked last minute as I wasn’t sure if I would be able to get to London due to the train strikes and so room availability was obviously limited. I booked an executive twin as there were no queen beds available and was actually pleasantly surprised by the size of the bed. I received a notification around lunchtime informing me that my room was ready, the earliest I have ever known. The room was modern and spacious and both the room and bathroom immaculate. 
The concierge was welcoming and all the staff so polite. The bar was tastefully decorated for Christmas and great for a couple of drinks before heading out. When I returned later in the evening I was too late for the restaurant but the guy on the front desk was so helpful in assisting me with a suitable takeaway. 
The bed was so comfortable and I enjoyed a great sleep. Breakfast was enjoyable and the checkout seamless. 
I’ve had several less than acceptable Hilton stays recently but Hilton Bankside renewed my confidence in the brand.
Thank you again for a great stay.",5,2022,12,17
120,Great stay,Love the Bankside it’s always Christmassy this time of year. Nice breakfast too with lots of selection. South Bank is cool place to stay which lots to experience along the river and close to Tower Bridge and Borough Market.  Sayyad serves us today at breakfast thank you 👍,5,2022,12,17
120,Favourite hotel in London,"Love how much effort they put in decorating the reception at Christmas. Always a nice surprise to see what’s been done this year. Also like the fact they’ve got rid of those silly plastic toiletry bottles (how many of those do Hilton throw into landfill each year?)

Breakfast is fantastic too.",5,2022,12,17
120,Great All-round,"The buffet-style breakfast is great with a variety of different options for a breakfast meal. From yoghurt to croissants to omelets. The executive lounge is excellent and really feels very premium, the food served during the evening has also been great and also is switched up everyday so it’s not boring. Rooms are great and very clean. Overall it has been a great holiday experience at the Hilton London Bankside.",5,2022,12,17
120,Daniel (Doorman) gave us a fabulous welcome and couldn't have been more helpful.,"Arriving to a warm welcome and being offered a glass of very delicious wine made a fabulous start to another stay at this wonderfully relaxed hotel.
In the city yes but retaining a vibe that belies its location - love this place and cannot wait to return!",5,2022,12,16
120,Excellent location and service,The Hilton Bankside is a lovely modern hotel located on the South Bank beside the Tate Modern . Restaurant and bar area were lovely with very welcoming staff. Added bonus of a lovely swimming pool and fitness suite . Great location for access to St Paul’s and central London with railway and tube stations within short walk . Had a great stay !,5,2022,12,15
120,Welcoming staff and great location,"The location is great. Just near the Tate and not too crowded.  The hotel staff are welcoming, breakfast is fab! And the room is comfy and welcoming. The bar is also very nice specializing in Gin. There are Bicycles you can rent and in general good options of food around the hotel.",5,2022,12,14
120,Best Hilton option in London,"First time staying in this particular Hlton and it was great. The hotel is quiet modern, room  was of a  good size ( for London) and bathroom was large. Facing a courtyard so very quiet at day and night. No upgrade for diamond member and lowest flower, but  again room was fine.  The location is very convenient next to tate modern, in walking distance to several tube lines, boats etc. There are plenty of restaurants around as well. The breakfast was nice with a good selection, not super large but definitely enough. The lounge was really good and the staff very friendly, drinks are served at the table and there is a small but changing food selection. Space is modern and cosy for some coffee or tea during the day. What I loved is the pool in the basement, not only does it open early in the morning  but it is a proper pool where it is possible to swim and not just a spa/relax bath. There is also a 24 hours gym that is compact but has modern machines.  I would definitely return,",5,2022,12,12
120,Meeting future daughter in law,"My future daughter in law and I stayed for almost a week in this hotel.  Every detail was perfect!  The staff is attentive and polite, the hotel is clean and quiet, and it is conveniently located in a neighborhood off the beaten (touristy) path, yet easy to access transportation or walk. We are Hilton Diamond members and the lounge was amazing! The whole level of service in every area of the hotel was a positive experiece. This will be our go-to hotel any time we are in London!",5,2022,12,12
120,My GO TO place in London,"This is my GO TO hotel in London. Perfect for me! I stay in this hotel a lot for business and even on personal trips into London. It is new, fresh, modern and clean and has fantastic group of loyal staff who go above and beyond all of the time.
There are too many people to call out but I must mention 2 people. Firstly Natasha the guest services manager is great, she is friendly professional and always looks after me. John the doorman is the other person who again just makes this place great. I plan to continue to use this as my London base for the foreseeable future and have brought many colleagues to this hotel as well. 
The facilities are great, pool is lovely, breakfast top notch and the club lounge is the icing on the cake.
Thanks for making my stays so comfortable and look forward to many more! ",5,2022,12,12
120,Terrible service !,"Went here with my husband for a night. Service was terrible was told that the restaurant was open to serve food until 12 from receptionist when we went in they said they stop serving at 10pm. Ordered room service which took around 40mins ( for a toastie ) so had to cancel order in the end as it took forever. 
Pillows were very uncomfortable. 
Woke up early due to noise from roadworks outside.",1,2022,12,11
120,Best hotel for families,"Bankside London is a great hotel for kids. It  has a fantastic indoor pool, great breakfast and the staff were amazing with the kids. Made our stay so pleasant and easy. We stayed in a one bed suite which would be perfect for a family of 4, as has a double sofa bed in a separate room with its own separate toilet. Thanks for a great stay and will be back again for sure!",5,2022,12,11
120,Amazing stay at a remarkable property,The entire staff of the Hilton Bankside seemed to go above and beyond each and every day.  The room was the very definition of comfort. The breakfast was a remarkable way to start every morning and the Executive Lounge was a great respite in bustling London. Easy tube ride to anywhere In London. Can’t wait to go back!,5,2022,12,10
120,Bottomless brunch of fun!,"We visited for the bottomless brunch at Christmas. Great buffet (not usually a buffet fan but this had wonderful variation and seemed to be good quality produce), excellent service (thank you Livia) , live music outstanding. Thank you for making our party great fun!",5,2022,12,10
120,"Hilton bankside during Christmas time , work trip","Stayed at Hilton Bankside for 6 nights and had a great experience with the personnel, overall service and the housekeeping.  The breakfast was nice and food at the bar was good as well. Very attentive personnel, loved the Christmas sweaters! Appreciate the attention of the personnel during dining hours, Daniel the doorman, Annie from the Distillery and all the reception team were great!!!",5,2022,12,10
120,Festive London trip,Lovely room. Great location. Friendly staff. Abi Baby in the Exec Lounge at breakfast was super helpful and lovely. Gym and pool petite but perfect. Fizz on arrival to mark the festive period. Ideal room upgrade because they could. All in all - a lovely stay.,5,2022,12,10
120,Great hotel and service,"Service. Friendly. Great breakfast. Exec lounge food👍. All some good attributes of the hotel. Very attentive in the lounge (maybe clear the glasses away too quickly when not even finished!) and also very attentive at breakfast especially the server Sayyad Eddeen. 

Front desk staff were brilliant especially John the concierge and Tanzila. 

Only negative is the hotel like to use dim lighting everywhere!  I had to find a light so I could use the qr code they gave me to write this review!  The bedrooms need stronger lighting or at least you should have the choice!

Thanks all.",5,2022,12,10
120,Nice support,Very pleasant stay and well trained staff. Special thanks to Alessandra who has always supported us  very kindly for every request. Rooms are also comfortable and neat. You won't go wrong choosing this hotel. The hotel restaurant is also a good one.,5,2022,12,09
120,Totally recommend,"Daniel Doorman was amazing. He was the first one welcomed us into the hotel, helped with our car valet, answered any questions we have and helped us find reservations for afternoon tea and such. He offered a unique and great customer service and we totally appreciate it as first time visitors to London. I recommend bank side hotel and make sure you look for Daniel! You won’t regret it",5,2022,12,08
120,Such a wonderful place to stay in London,"Stayed here for 4 days and 3 nights. Definitely had a good experience with the amenities and especially with the staff who were very accommodating to my request. Special thanks to Jefferson who assisted me all throughout my stay, as well as to Leandro and Alessandra.  ",4,2022,12,07
120,Nice and Comfortable.,"Spent two nights here in December 2022 and it was a very pleasant stay. The hotel is tucked into a small side street close to Blackfriars. Closest tube station is Southwark, although I tended to just go over to Blackfriars station because it's more connected. There weren't too many interesting restaurants in the neighborhood but it's walkable to Borough market.

Hotel had a nice basic breakfast spread, made nicer with made to order omelets, cooked eggs, pancakes, and waffles. 

The standout for me was that the bed was quite comfortable with feather pillows and comforters going very appreciated in December temperatures. I didn't hear a lot of noise from within or without the hotel, my room was facing basically another hotel. The bathroom was designed very well, and it's not always the case that a walk-in shower (in this case a step-up shower) didn't leak all over the floor but this one kept it contained. The slippers were appreciated and the bathrobe was definitely above average quality for even a fancy hotel.

The impression I got was that the most frequent clientele were there for business or conferences, not a lot of leisure travelers.",4,2022,12,05
120,Lovely breakfast,"We stay regularly at the Hilton bankside and the service is always 5 ⭐️ 

The beds are so comfortable! Guaranteed you’ll have a good nights sleep! 

We always look forwards to the breakfast- there is such a variety and the chefs specialty pancakes are amazing!! 
We were served by Sayyad who was very attentive throughout our visit- thank you! 
We can’t wait to return❤️",5,2022,12,05
120,Attentive and helpful staff,Staff are friendly and always helpful. Sayyad Eddeeh in the breakfast room was very helpful and served us well. Very attentive. Comfortable hotel  with good location. Breakfast very good with good selection ,5,2022,12,05
120,Thank you Sayyad!,Started each morning with a delicious breakfast in a hospitable dining room with coffee at our table poured by Sayyad Eddeen. Our room could not be better. Crabtree and Evelyn products. Fluffy towels. Turn down service with every amenity. ,5,2022,12,05
120,Professionalism and Attentiveness,"Always love staying here. All of the staff are lovely but today I would like to call out Abi Baby for her professionalism and attentiveness whilst at breakfast.  Thank you for looking after me and hubby. 

Also to John in concierge for ALWAYS looking us. ",5,2022,12,04
120,Perfect stay,"Stayed here a few times previously but this was the first post covid with all restrictions lifted and it was just as good if not better than its always been.
Got an upgrade to a lovely suite with lounge access.
Spent some time in the pool which was like having my own private pool.
Great selection of food and drinks in the Exec lounge.
Staff at check in, at breakfast and in the lounge, especially Yen, were a credit to the hotel and Hilton.
Special mention to the concierge who saw we were trying to take a selfie in front of the Christmas decorations and came over to take some photos for us.",5,2022,12,02
120,Early December Visit,"Our trip has been lovely. The hotel has had everything we've wanted and the staff has been amazing. I'd like to call out what a great job that Daniel Doormen has done, his attention to detail is great.",5,2022,12,02
120,Beautiful and clean with good amenities,"This is a fabulously upgraded hotel with gorgeous rooms and clean bathrooms.  The Christmas decorations were festive and fun.  We were greeted by the doorman with an offer of champagne which we enjoyed.  Our friend was in the Penthouse for her pre wedding festivities and that room was a sweet suite.   Our friends used the pool and fitness room and they gave it high marks.  There are several places to eat nearby.  All in all a beautiful hotel.  

If I’m being a bit picky, Breakfast was not as hot as it should be and tea was self serve by cup and not served in a teapot which I really enjoy when I’m in England.   The other downside is there isn’t a green park nearby to walk to or thru and this isn’t the prettiest part of town.  Public transportation was not as convenient as we’d like - nearly a mile to Victoria station over cobblestone with a suitcase.   We also couldn’t figure out the climate control which made it hot at night.  I would definitely ask for help next time.  

Otherwise it was super nice and fun to stay there with friends for a special event since most of our time was spent at the hotel.",4,2022,12,01
120,An enjoyable stay on London's Southbank,"Stayed once more at  my favourite hotel in central London. Its location, very convenient for access to the Underground via the Jubilee Line, is close to the Southbank  with the Tate Modern, the Globe, and Borough Market all within easy  reach on foot.
The hotel has a modern vibe and the staff are very friendly and helpful. My particular thanks to John (as always) on the front desk, Raquel on the check -in desk, Dionne who serves breakfast, and helpful Yen in the Executive Lounge, whose smile always welcomes guests.",5,2022,12,01
120,ABBA weekend away with friends with trip to the Sky Bar,"This is the best Hilton hotel we use around the country. It is clean and comfortable and has the most helpful and friendly staff. Congratulations to the management team and their staff. Situation in London is brilliant for all attractions just a short walk away.
Special mention for Alessandra on reception and Gabor in the bar area . All go above and beyond",5,2022,12,01
120,One of the best hotels I’ve stayed in,Stayed here for one night in October. Staff were very friendly and helpful. Room was excellent with great facilities including fridge. Hotel also had pool and gym. Would highly recommend for those wanting to stay within Central London for an affordable price.,5,2022,11,28
120,Great stay,"Another perfect stay at Hilton bankside , check in was super easy and very welcoming we had best night sleep and our daughter enjoyed her beautiful baby cot . Breakfast was everything and more you could wish for , delicious cooked breakfast. Special thanks to sayyad eddeen who took his time to look after us and was very professional. ",5,2022,11,28
120,Great Service by Salma Adam,"Salma was so welcoming and brought me glass of warm milk just like I wanted. She  checked on me later to ask if I needed anything else. Great breakfast! 

Tyrique who checked me in was also fantastic  and gave me a warm welcome after arriving so late. He also offered me a complimentary upgrade. 

Great hotel and stay.",5,2022,11,28
120,5 Nights / 5 Dots,"There are a lot of Hilton properties in London.  After looking at various reviews, I chose the Hilton London Bankside.  Overall, a 5/5 experience with a few minor inconveniences.  Breakfast is excellent in the restaurant and I had a great experience in the executive lounge (thanks to Yen, Kadiatu, Sofia, and team) in the evening.  The swimming pool is a hidden gem and nightly turndown service is a nice touch.  In terms of the ""minor inconveniences"", the TV went down for around 24 hours and it took multiple requests to get this fixed. In addition, the view from my room was a brick wall and other guest rooms around the corner.  However, when on vacation, I tried to be out and about anyway.

I would recommend this property to anyone staying in London.",5,2022,11,27
120,Best Hilton in London,"The place was beautiful and smelled absolutely amazing. I loved the decorations and all the employees were very kind and helpful. Daniel the doorman was so helpful as well and very kind. He greeted me at the door and offered me a glass of Prosecco. 
 The room was awesome and very comfortable. I highly recommend this Hilton! ",5,2022,11,27
120,5 star hotel with a 3 star experience,"We are currently staying here and have been quite disappointed. However we shall start with the pros:

-lovely staff at check in as well as cleaners 
-indoor pool and gym
-gorgeous lobby 
-plush towels and robes in the room
-rainfall showerhead
-charging ports
-tv and radio
-comfy chair and office space

The cons:

.The beds were hard as a rock so we got a terrible sleep every night and the pillows are extremely soft and flat.

The most disappointing part is that we booked it due to its central location near the train station. However, every night the train station closed as early as 630 pm without notice. We are traveling with a newborn and walking from an additional stop made it very inconvenient. 

The icing on the cake was when they started construction completely destroying the road outside the lobby so cars couldn’t even access us. When we chose to use Uber or a taxi as an alternative we had to navigate telling our driver where to meet us. This all would have been fine had this been disclosed or had the price reflected the inconveniences. For a 5 star hotel, it’s been a 3 star experience.",3,2022,11,26
120,Bankside wedding stay,"We had a great experience, greeted with Champaign, beautiful holiday decorations a nice breakfast buffet and nice room
The staff were all very attentive.  
Location is good and a quick walk to sites and Park for morning run
Will definitely come back.",5,2022,11,26
120,Great central location and very attentive staff,"Fabulous hotel in a great central location. Rooms were spotless and staff all very friendly. Great service from all, especially Selena Cosias at breakfast.  Really enjoyed the executive lounge and the cocktails in the bar. ",5,2022,11,25
120,This should have been a 5 star review but unfortunately we had a very disappointing end to our stay,"This should have been a 5 star review. The reservation team were really helpful, the check in was excellent, very comfortable, spotlessly clean hotel, food was good and the room was excellent. The issue came right at the end of our stay. We returned to the hotel to collect our case and while I tried to book an Uber we were basically kicked out of the hotel! One of the door staff watched over me as tried to book the car. As we had a little wait, the door man flagged a black cab down and literally threw our case in the cab. His attitude towards us quite upset my wife. We were made to feel like trespassers. It really did spoil what up until that point had been an excellent stay. 
I wouldn’t want to put anyone off this property as we could not have asked for a more comfortable hotel, however if you plan to leave any cases with the hotel please be prepared to leave very quickly!",3,2022,11,24
120,The Best As Always ,Not my first time and definitely not the last. Went over the weekend with my mum to see an exhibition in Tate Modern and booked a room in this property. This property never disappoints you. The hotel is operating as same as pre-pandemic level. Hotel facilities are always top-notched. I would say that this is one of the rarest Hilton properties in London that not scaling back in terms of giving the benefits to Hilton Honors members. Some Hilton would charge you to be upgraded in the room you should be upgraded but this property will acknowledge your membership in a very best way being a Hilton Honors member. The breakfast was superb. The best in the UK. The complimentary non-alcoholic drinks in the fridge in your room is a delightful welcome. The executive lounge is the very best in the UK. We are talking about UK - not only London. The candy bar by the Front Desk is something unique and exciting. Shout out to the Front Desk Team Member named Yohan who accommodated my humble request of bath tub. Definitely would go back and highly recommended to everyone.,5,2022,11,22
120,"Great Stay , Great Place","I really was impressed with this hotel, it was new, clean and really well designed.  Great food in house.  Amazing Breakfast. Quiet inside rooms.  Nice shower and linens  Just a really great overall experience.",5,2022,11,21
120,Five star Staff & service!,"Hilton brand does not disappoint. Great value for money and friendly staff.

Everyone gave their best with extra mile service. Thank you all for making us feel comfortable and so at home.Congrats to the management for a well trained staff. Keep up the good work.",5,2022,11,18
120,Wonderful visit!,"This is my go to hotel in London. I love the quieter area of Bankside. It's so close to the Tate Modern and right across Millennium bridge from St Paul's. Mostly I love the service at this hotel. Being a Diamond member we get access to the lounge which has lovely offerings. The people that work in lounge are so friendly and helpful. The full breakfast also provided to Diamond members is amazing. The concierge is wonderful, I wish I remembered his name but he overheard us saying we needed a pair of pliers and he came running over with pliers! Now that's service!!! Thank you!!!",5,2022,11,18
120,A real hidden gem,"This hotel was amazing!!!! The staff were fantastic and went above and beyond to be helpful. The lounge access was well worth it with the canapés enough for a meal.
Greeted with a glass of Prosecco on arrival set the tone for the trip. An amazing place to stay with exceptional staff.",5,2022,11,18
120,Fantastic hotel,"Stayed here for 3 nights to celebrate a special birthday with a friend.
Beautiful reception with gorgeous fresh flowers.
Welcomed with a glass of Prosecco.
Executive twin room on the 2nd floor. Large room which was incredibly quiet with very comfy beds.
The executive lounge is definitely worth the extra. 
Breakfast in the main dining room and executive lounge is fantastic with amazing selection.
Very helpful and friendly staff.
Great location - 5 mins walk to Southwark and Blackfriars and 15 min walk to London Bridge.
Lots of restaurants within walking distance,
5 min walk from the Tate.",5,2022,11,16
120,Fantastic Hotel with awesome staff!!!,"Best Hilton property in the UK and one of the best hotels in London!!! Bankside is a fantastic hotel in a great location with modern rooms and facilities, and truly exceptional staff at check-in, housekeeping and the restaurant. Always greeted by a warm welcome from the moment I walked in the door... The awesome customer experience provided by Sofia, Melania and Kadiatu in the Executive Lounge is what makes the difference for me. These 3 ladies are a credit to the Hilton brand.
I highly recommend Hilton London Bankside.",5,2022,11,16
120,another great stay,"It was yet another awesome stay at Hilton Bankside.  We arrived early and were graciously permitted an early check in.  The man who checked us in was so nice and helpful.  The room was nice, comfortable (one night I slept 11 hours) and clean.  The hotel makes every effort to maintain the premises and keep it clean at all times.  The executive lounge was a great value each night.  The rotated each night taco night, spaghetti/meatballs and thai curry.  The breakfast buffet in Oxbo was as amazing as ever.  ",5,2022,11,11
120,TWO WEEKS AT HILTON LONDON BANKSIDE,"Excellent hotel located in Bankside, south of the Thames. Next to two minimarts and a local pub the White Hart,  very short walk to a good Chinese restaurant, Starbucks, Pauls and no more than 15min walk to Borough Market.  Service in the hotel excellent all round.  Cant find anything to complain about.",5,2022,11,07
120,10/10,No complaints. Hygiene 10/10. No disturbances and staff were more than helpful and very friendly! Would definitely recommend. I mentioned in the notes that it was our anniversary and all the staff knew as well as leaving us a small treat in our room! Really happy. Couldn’t ask for more.,5,2022,11,07
120,Pleasant Stay,"My stay at Bankside was very nice. I had access to the lounge and Fiadiatu Conteh, who works in the lounge, was very nice and helpful. I had stayed at this hotel a few months before and she was just as pleasant.",5,2022,11,07
120,London trip with two toddlers ,"Our first family trip to London and the Hilton worked brilliantly for travelling with children. 15 minute walk from Waterloo station, within short walking distance of borough market, London eye, the shard and plenty of restaurants/grocery shops just outside. 

On booking we requested no accessible rooms so was disappointed to check in to ….an accessible room. This was quickly rectified by reception and we where moved to a room on the 4th floor overlooking a rooftop bee and herb garden. The room itself was MUCH brighter and pleasant than the previous room so if you do end up with an accessible room it’s worth asking to move. 

We found the hotel overall to be clean, children loved the pool (and that there’s no specific child swim times). Breakfast was just OK, overall nothing really felt or shouted 5 star, was more of a comfortable 4 star to us. Pleasant enough stay. 

",4,2022,11,04
120,"Great Location, Rooms and Staff",Wonderful hotel with great service (especially Joseph who was very helpful with recommendations and nice to our children. Apparently trip advisor demands 200 characters minimum for reviews so this is filler,5,2022,11,03
120,Hilton bankside London,We were traviling as big family and had over 10 bags! But the doorman Daniel has always been very helpful and friendly even when helping to load the taxis with all those suitcases! Many thanks to the always kind team of hilton bankside london,5,2022,11,03
120,Good choice when in London,"Very nice hotel with a good service. The pool is surprisingly big and the location is great, although located close to train lines, it is was very well isolated and we were not disturbed by any outside noise. We have booked a room with lounge access and spent some time there in the evening (thanks Yen and Sofia!).",5,2022,11,02
120,Memorable stay,"We visited for 3 nights whilst taking our granddaughter to see Frozen.  We had two family connecting rooms, which was perfect for our family.  We mostly ate in our room due to our granddaughter being 4 years old and needing to go to bed.  The food was exceedingly good, and was delivered in a heated cabinet. The staff could not be faulted, and our room was immaculate.  The levels of cleanliness were outstanding.  We will certainly be returning before Christmas. ",5,2022,10,30
120,Night out in London,"Superb hotel - arrived early not expecting a room - accommodated us and allocated a room immediately 
Valet parking is a dream  - Joseph was superb 
Breakfast was amazing - so much choice
The digital door key and check in through the app is so easy to use",5,2022,10,30
120,Hotel wonderful! Bar restaurant not so much.,"I almost gave this hotel a very bad review but realized that would be highly unfair as the only bad experience we had was with the bar restaurant OXBO. Funny how one bad experience with a server can complete turn a wonderful stay from a 5 star rating to a 1 to no star. So I will review the OXBO separately. As for a hotel we had a wonderful stay. All the staff from the moment we pulled in and entered were friendly, welcoming and helpful. The hotel is very clean and comfortable. We loved the turn down service. The candy cart in the lobby was a special little treat too! As far as location it all depends on where you are headed in London and what your interests are but we found it to be nicely located to much in walking distance or a short but sometimes lengthy (traffic) Uber ride. Thank you all for making our first trip to London awesome!",5,2022,10,27
120,"London sights, Hilton delights!","I've been to Hilton hotels before and I was rally doubting whether I should book one for my first ever trip to London, but clearly, I was wrong! My London experience was amazing thanks to the Hilton Bankside Hotel. It was close to many sights (including Tate Modern, Shakespeare's Globe, Millennium Bridge), the rooms were spacious, the staff was very polite and the pool facility was a great bonus! The only thing a bit disappointing was the OXBO restaurant's selection for dinner, it was quite poor and everything took too long to cook. Otherwise, I'd come again!",4,2022,10,27
120,WOW!  One of my favorite Hiltons across the globe!  You just need to stay here!,"I’ve stayed here in the past and now for the first time post covid.  Nothing has changed!  Still major WOW in food, beverage, housekeeping and service!!

 At check in my Diamond status was acknowledged and immediately an excellent upgrade was given.   Jeongbeen checked me in and each day of my 5 day stay greeted me warmly. He definitely understands how service should be delivered.  In fact each person we encountered from the front doorman to the food service staff to the housekeeping personnel were friendly and ready to assist.  Made me wish I could just live here!  

All food from the restaurant to the bar area was well done.  Breakfast was delicious.  Many options from breads to fruits to vegetables to meat.  Very well done! The executive lounge is absolutely perfect.  It’s open all day, which is wonderful when returning from an outing and needing to get a quick cold beverage or cup of tea.  The 6 to 8 Happy Hour really met my needs for a quick bite between business and the theater.  There’s even a “welcome” table near the check in desk where each day you can grab a quick infused water to drink or fill up a little cup with various candy such as licorice or marshmallow bites etc.  All complimentary of course.

The room is spacious and extremely clean. It was also serviced by 10 am every day and given nightly turndown.  WOW!! Made my stay sooooo relaxing!  The lovely pool area provides a good swim at the end of the day and the water is comfortably warm.

Also love the vibe of the Bankside area.  Far less touristy and more “real” with pubs and restaurants.  Yet it is so close to the Southwark or Blackfriars or London Bridge subway terminals when wanting to travel across the city.  

Love this Hilton.  Extremely well managed and my congrats to the GM for showing dedicated oversight to operations.  Wish every Hilton could emulate their model. I will be back.  You should look no further and book your stay now!",5,2022,10,26
120,Quiet Oasis in a Good Location,"My buddy and I went to London to see some football (soccer) matches and do some sightseeing.   We picked this Hilton because my friend had stayed there, and he liked the amenities, particularly the Executive Lounge, as well as the location, near the Tate Modern.   But the icing on the cake was how quiet the room was, which is particularly welcome after a long trip.   The rooms facing the interior and away from the elevator are very quiet (albeit without a view, if you care about that).   The rooms are small, but who goes to London to hang out in the room?

We also tried the restaurants and bar, which were very good, and the Concierge service was quite helpful   We both recommend the Executive Lounge as it can serve as a nice place to relax after a long day.",5,2022,10,25
120,I'll happily be back,"I had a really incredible experience staying at the hotel, this was my 5th stay and I will definitely be back. The rooms are lovely and clean, and the staff is always happy to help and accommodate requests where they can - I had a particularly positive experience with the Manager of Guest relations, Chrissa Anastasopoulou, who was very helpful when I unfortunately damaged the furniture in the room. ",5,2022,10,25
120,Great Stay.,"Always have high expectations for Hilton and this didn't disappoint.
Check in was easy. Yohan really helpful and Consierge even grabbed us a Prosecco.
Rooms were nice and big with the comfiest bedding.
Great location for exploring London with some great eateries around Borough.",5,2022,10,25
120,Great family October half term holiday,"Our favourite London family hotel. 
Our children love:
- the breakfasts!
- the sweet trolley
- the swimming pools

We (the parents) love:
- big family adjoining rooms
- Southwark location, near Tate modern, south bank, tubes. Most Ubers cost us £9
- quiet oasis just out the main hussle and bussle of life in London, but close enough to everything!

We shall return",5,2022,10,24
120,Mediocre service - Clean and spacious rooms,"My wife and I chose the Hilton Bankside for our stay to celebrate a special birthday. The room was spacious and clean and the pool area open up to 11pm is always a lovely way to end your day. The concierge service was not great, lacking in politeness, no eye contact and frankly underwhelming for a 5 stars hotel. On a positive note, Daniel doorman was lovely, friendly and never too far when needed.",3,2022,10,24
120,Great! x,"It was a lovely weekend getaway, the room was beautiful and the service was amazing. The doorman, Daniel, helped us once we checked out to collect the car and was very friendly helping with our bags x",5,2022,10,22
120,Simply the best 😍,"We just love this hotel
3rd stay & i wouldn’t stay anywhere else now in London. 
From the minute you walk through the doors the service/attention from every staff member you meet is amazing. 

Best hotel and incredible staff. 

Love the glass of fizz on arrival 2! 🍾",5,2022,10,21
120,Paul Cox,"Lovely staff, room and hotel clean and fresh as I would expect, staff engaging especially doorman Daniel (great suit)
Disappointed that the bar closed so early and a number of people commented but being moved on when they were clearly having a great time and spending money.",4,2022,10,21
120,Great hotel,"I stayed here for 3 night this week.  I have stayed on many other occasions too and always find this hotel to very clean and well presented.  The front desk staff are very attentive and the lady that checked me out today, Alexandra, was very helpful.  I would highly recommend this hotel",5,2022,10,20
120,"Great hotel, would stay again","I had the most genuine welcome at check in that I’ve had in a hotel for years. The lady on reception was absolutely super, and made me feel incredibly welcome! My regret was I didn't catch her name in order to credit her! But she was wearing a head-scarf if that helps management to identify her to pass on the praise, if they read this!

The room itself was really nice, with a large king size bed and a sofa. I usually think Hilton’s are a bit dated but this was modern and comfortable. It was unfortunately, a little gloomy inside with both the small window and dark furnishings, but it did look pleasant at least. The windows DO NOT OPEN unfortunately. 

The TV had a good range of channels, but no challenge TV ;( 

The night light switch is absolute genius. (It's a switch next to the bedside table that turns the under sink lights on in bathroom). No more accidental blinding / waking of partners! 

Toiletries were Crabtree & Evelyn which are always nice to use, especially the soap - and there were plenty of them 

All in all, a great hotel. Would stay here again for sure!",4,2022,10,19
120,Definetly come back,"We spend our autumn holiday in London each year, and we have tried many different hotels. This was definetly the best hotel we have stayed at. It was a superb experience. We stayed at the hotel for a week. The interconnecting rooms were spacious, clean and quiet. Breakfast was delicious, the chefs were friendly and made great omelettes and pancakes with a smile. All of the staff were friendly and professional. Daniel the doorman went the extra mile,  was funny and made the kids and us love him. Will definetly come back to this great hotel next year",5,2022,10,19
120,Perfect!,"I stayed at the Hilton London. In the lounge i met Yen and this lady was very very very service minded. Continuesly asking ‘are you ok Sir’, ‘how can i help you Sir’ incredible! Thanks you Hilton for hiring Yen. Will come back soon :-)",5,2022,10,18
120,A quiet oasis in the big city,"This was a very positive experience. On arrival I was offered a glass of Prosecco while checking in. Staff was friendly and polite throughout our stay. The rooms were surprisingly spacious for a big city hotel. Rooms and the rest of the hotel are tastefully decorated and well maintained. I did not hear any street noise while in the hotel, even though I had a room facing the street. Breakfast was very good.

The hotel is in a quiet location, just a short walk from the Tate Modern art gallery and the Thames riverbank walk with lots of restaurants.

If traveling by public transport, the hotel is about a 7 min walk from the Southwark underground station.",5,2022,10,18
120,Birthday weekend,"This is our go to London hotel & it didn’t disappoint.
We were welcomed back to the hotel by Daniel the doorman who is an absolute star, always so helpful & goes above & beyond his duties.
Our suite wasn’t quite what we expected & it was no issue to move us to the Vegan suite which was stunning.
Breakfast was plentiful, delicious & staff very helpful. 
Highly recommended & will definitely return soon",5,2022,10,17
120,Outstanding Location and Incredible Customer Service!,"The Hilton London Bankside was a 5 Star experience from start to finish. Friendly staff, clean rooms, exceptional Executive Lounge, delicious food and drinks, and an ideal location for seeing some of London's most cherished sites. Particularly, regarding the team at the hotel, Sam, Jefferson, and Daniel went the extra mile (or kilometer) to ensure our stay was welcoming, full of adventure, cozy, and that we'll be repeat customers. Thanks to you three and the entire team! See you again soon.",5,2022,10,16
120,"Good facilities, miserly receptionist ","Good value for money and good amenities. The pool is nice and the rooms are clean with comfortable beds. Modern design throughout the hotel. The breakfast buffet is delicious and the chefs making the pancakes and eggs are very kind. 
However: we have a Hilton honors membership and had been to this particular hotel over 15 times, always returning as the experience we had was always great. The last three times we stayed here we brought my sister along to stay with us. Upon check-out, the very rude Spanish receptionist informed us that if we bring a third guest we would need to pay an additional 15 pounds and asked us to pay this. We found this unacceptable as we have spent thousands of pounds here over many months on the room, room service and in the restaurants. When my sister joined us we paid for an additional breakfast and she consumed food at the restaurants and from room service. We had never been asked at a hotel of this standard to pay extra for another person in the room. Indeed it was very miserly for the receptionist to demand this given that we were frequent customers of the hotel and had spent a lot of money here. We had booked the Hilton in Miami as well. Needless to say we have not been back since and will not be returning to the entire Hilton franchise because of this. I find it unnecessary and insulting to ruin a frequenting customer relationship over a trivial 15 pounds.",3,2022,10,16
120,Excellent Service ,"While the hotel is beautiful and the location excellent, it’s the attention to personal service that really makes this hotel special. From the moment you arrive, you get the feeling that they care about you, and the quality of your stay with them.",5,2022,10,14
120,Hilton Bankside London,Have stayed at every Hilton property in London.  This one is the best managed of all.  Staff are both genuinely friendly and efficient.   Their executive lounge is the only one n e that starts evening canopes and drinks ON TIME.  They serve a lovely Cava instead of the dreadful Proseco served at other London lounges.  The food is surprisingly good.  Rare to have buffet pasta served at right texture.  Kudos to all.,5,2022,10,13
120,Another excellent visit to a great London hotel,"I stayed at Hilton Bankside last Friday night and, as usual, had an excellent stay. I was very warmly welcomed at check in by numerous staff and even given a glass of prosecco (which I never turn down!). I wanted to specifically thank Krissa and Allessandra who tried really hard to find me a nice room and were incredibly welcoming and hospitable. 

Rooms at this hotel are elegant and well-designed with good quality modern bathrooms and effective sound-proofing. This is in stark contrast to a number of Hilton properties in the UK which are, to put it mildly, in need of renovation. 

Bankside offers excellent value to Hilton Honors Diamond members. The executive lounge is large but very well appointed and furnished, with a feature 'fireplace'. Cava was being served freely when I visited for cocktail hour, and the staff were friendly and welcoming. Breakfast at Oxbo is also excellent, the Cumberland Sausages being particularly memorable.

The indoor pool at this hotel is a fantastic feature. Long enough to swim laps for exercise and accompanied by a jacuzzi for relaxing. There is a decent gym with a Concept2 rowing machine, which I always notice as a former rower!

The hotel is easily accessible on foot from Southwark tube. Overall, I highly recommend this property generally, and, for my fellow Diamonds, it is easily one of the best, if not the best, options in London.",5,2022,10,12
120,Exceptional Hotel and Outstanding Service,Excellent hotel and in particular the service by Melanie Yen!!!!! She has been wonderful! My partner stays at the Bankside Hilton most weeks and can not speak more highly of her exemplary service! On the whole the service by all the staff makes you feel welcome and the rooms are 5 star!!!,5,2022,10,10
120,Great hotel in the heart of London,"This is a great hotel with friendly staff and nice rooms. Perfect for a business trip, it is well located with easy access to multiple rail and bus options. The concierge staff was excellent and took great care of my mom, who was visiting with me and sightseeing during the week. At the end of each day when she returned they would ask her about her experiences, and they really cared for her well being. We would definitely stay again. ",5,2022,10,09
120,"Saints Game, NFL in London",Joseph was very kindness the most helpful gentleman. Seeing him everyday with his warm kind smile and heart was very refreshing. He made my stay at Hilton Bankside so delightful.  Joseph went above and beyond the call of duty.,5,2022,10,09
120,This is?  Still the go to Hilton in London,"Small changes make a big impact,  the staff excellent as usual but the hotel is slipping on the executive offering.  

The executive lounge used to be one of the best I’d in the group, however, this is now a lower standard no smoked salmon or prawns just pretty poor ham the hot main of pasta I did not even want to try.  For the premium paid to stay this seems no where near the previous experience bearing in mind I could have stayed at tower bridge for two thirds of the price.  Breakfast no service in the lounge where there used to be white linen just an empty room practically no atmosphere.  Part of the pleasure was having a leisurely morning meal in a relaxed environment no longer the case.

This really was part of the extra enjoyment of staying at Bankside and worth paying that premium. Looking forward I would certainly think twice about going to one of the other hotels in the group.",4,2022,10,07
120,Super service,"All the staff were extremely helpful, welcoming and nothing was to much trouble for them to make our stay luxuriously comfortable. Special thanks to Daniel Doorman who welcomed us from our taxi, offering water and processor at check in and taking our luggage to our room and at the end of our stay managed to flag us a taxi even at busy time.",5,2022,10,07
120,Birthday Treat,"Hotel is very nice, clean and modern. We had a large room and large walk in shower. We were able to check in early but wish we could have had a higher floor. Bed was very comfortable. Room had a safe, slippers, robes, coffeemaker and fridge.  
There are mini marts just across the street plus an Amazon Fresh.
We did order room service one night. It was delivered quickly and was well presented. It was a turkey club and fries and was just okay.
The breakfast was great - good selection to choose from.  You could also get eggs any way, pancakes, waffles and omelets made to order.
We started and ended our days on a happy note after being greeted by Daniel. He was so personable, interesting and helpful. He was always happily assisting guests. He definitely made a great impression and we enjoyed talking with him.
We were happy with our decision to stay here 6  nights for my birthday. We would definitely go back.",5,2022,10,05
120,Definitely worth a return visit!,"I stayed here for a week while seeing my daughter off to university.  Coming from overseas, we were very tired when we checked in and were happy to get into our room immediately.  We booked a twin room and it was perfect for the two of us. My favorite thing about the room was how quiet it was at night. We could get the room as cool as we wanted yet there was no noise from an air conditioner. The room itself was very clean with no damages, not even a scuff on the wall. The complimentary mineral water and juice was a nice touch.  It was also convenient to have the refrigerator drawer since we were staying for a week. The room decor is very sleek and modern.  The shower includes a rain shower head and a handheld that can be adjusted at an angle (better for those times when you don’t want your hair wet.) The first day we were there, I thought I heard something in the bathroom. I was pleasantly surprised to find that you can hear the TV in the bathroom as they’ve installed a speaker. You can turn the sound all the way down if you don’t want to hear it at all or adjust the volume to your preference.

As a diamond member, we were given access to the executive lounge. They serve appetizers and drinks from 6 to 8 PM although the lounge was open from 6 AM to 10 PM to sit or have a soda or water. They serve breakfast on the weekends but any day of the week we were able to eat at the breakfast buffet in the restaurant. The breakfast buffet is amazing and has a lot of options.  The restaurant itself is nicely decorated with plenty of tables and we enjoyed lingering over our coffee and tea in the mornings.

For my fellow Americans who like their drip coffee, this is not a thing and no one understood what I wanted (cream…half n half…does not translate.)  Every time I travel to London, I hope it catches on but so far drip coffee is not main stream. There was a hot kettle provided in the room though.  So I bought coffee bags (like teabags) at a grocery store and also some single cream. I was able to brew myself a decent cup of coffee this way. The executive lounge and the restaurant both had espresso machines which are OK in a pinch but if you like your drip coffee, come prepared.  

The front desk staff were incredibly helpful with all the questions we had, including where to buy decor and kitchenware for my daughter’s flat (dorm room.)  Every time we walked through the lobby, everyone was genuinely friendly and kind. Even if they were busy helping someone else, we received a smile.  And at certain times of the day, they had a little candy cart. I don’t eat much candy but it looked so visually appealing.

The hotel is in a quieter area yet close to the Borough Market, as well as a a quarter mile from the tube. There is an Amazon Fresh grocery store across the street and some nice restaurants nearby as well as the Tate Modern museum.

I find myself coming back to London in November to visit my daughter. I’d love to try different hotels but I will be booking Hilton London Bankside again because it was a wonderful visit! See you soon.",5,2022,10,05

I have to stay from the moment we drove up, to the time we departed, the staff were  first class. Everyone was pleasant  and welcoming and nothing was too much trouble.
The room was great and whilst we had to get a cab to get into the west end, it was also perfect for a walk to Borough Market.
Just great for customer service. Well done team Bankside.",5,2022,09,27
120,Excellent,"Stopped here as going to a show. This hotel is very well situated and the staff are all so helpful and very helpful.  Daniel the doorman was extremely helpful. He definitely went that extra mile for us! 
Will definitely recommend",5,2022,09,26
120,What a fantastic hotel,"From the moment we arrived to the moment we left nothing was too much trouble.
Daniel the doorman was exceptionally helpful and friendly, as soon as we arrived he greeted us with a smile and every time he saw us asked how our day had been, genuinely seeming interested he is a real asset to the team.

Breakfast was gorgeous, loads of choice including vegan & veggie options.

Beds super comfy, we stayed in a twin but the bed was larger than a single and I had the best nights sleep with heavy black curtains covering the window.

The location was fantastic we visited all the major landmarks and we got to most places within 20 minutes either by bus, tube or walking. 

I have recommended to all my friends & family and I will certainly stay again when I decide to do a tourist trip to London.

Only slight bug bare was it was a £10 table charge plus a £4 service charge for room service which I thought was abit steep but the food was really nice and after a long day around London we didn’t fancy going out so paid it but it’s a minor",5,2022,09,25
120,The amazing service in the executive lounge,Staying at the property tonight. The lady who took care of us in the lounge (Yen Kuong Ly) was absolutely amazing. She made us feel so special. It’s a great Hotel and the attentive nature of Yen just made it that much better),5,2022,09,22
120,Excellent Hotel in Downtown London,"We recently visited London as part of a cruise of the British Isles.   As a Hilton member, I checked the area and selected this hotel due to its location to several sights.  Did online check in and then when we got to the hotel, presented payment and passport for verification.  We got in a bit early due to an overnight flight, but we stored our luggage and then set off to explore the city for the day.  However, as a guest, we were given passes to the breakfast in the hotel.   GREAT FOOD.  Then we were off.   Got a text a few hours later that room was ready so we returned to refresh.   Had dinner at the bar (RECOMMEND, the Turkey Club)   

Room is nicely furnished.   Remember your Power plug converters if you're from the US.  Luckily I had two.  Slippers are provided to walk around in and a floor mat by the bed.  Our room was very quiet and the next day we left on our adventure of the British Isle Cruise.   Returned back 7 days later and had another great experience with the hotel and Staff.     We hope to return with the family in the near future and will definitely stay here again.   Thanks Hilton London Bankside for a great experience.",5,2022,09,20
120,Best hotel in London!,"I knew our stay was going to be amazing when we were enthusiastically greeted by Daniel the doorman who took our luggage and offered us a good chat and some candy from the candy bar! The rooms are immaculate, comfy, and we got a free tote bag and reusable cup. The staff is so attentive, personable, helpful and so so nice (can’t say enough about how great they all are). We had a great chat later with Daniel again. They go above and beyond here.",5,2022,09,19
120,Great hotel,"Great hotel, great facilities. It was a very pleasant stay with excellent location. The staff was generally good, helpful and servicial. The executive lounge was very good to work at and Yen Xuong at the lounge was amazing. The general atmosphere of the hotel is good for work and for families.",5,2022,09,15
120,BOOMBASTIC BRUNCH,"Just wanted to express my love and appreciation for this place..!!

It’s my favourite brunch restaurant in London ..!!

The staff are all so welcoming and professional.

Livid and Jean were sensational and really went through extra mile for us they were both so attentive to my particular dietary requirements. 

The food is glorious and such a wonderful variety. Loved the unlimited Starters and unlimited desserts so scrumptious..!!

I also loved the fact you have 4 courses ..!!

The ambience was amazing with a live musician.

The decor was fab ..!!

I just loved my visit from start to FINISH  and can’t wait to come back.

Lots of Love & Rainbow Kisses

120,Great family city break,"Lovely hotel, good service with very friendly staff, great standard of food, with an especially enjoyable breakfast, enjoyable cocktails, very relaxing. Well connected to whole city … especially using Uber even for the water taxi ! And choice of underground stations/lines., ",5,2022,09,12
120,"Come on guys, a little smile and a little service :)","I’ve stayed here about five times (I’ve basically stayed in all the London Hilton’s as a diamond member) in the past couple of years and it’s always been ok but never great. The staff go out of their way to tell you what you’re not entitled to and there is ALWAYS a queue for reception. It’s a shame as the hotel works with all the big things (nice rooms, fairly good location, excellent lounge, good air conditioning, good gym) but fails on the small things (staff make you feel like you are being cheeky by asking for stuff). Shame as it could be such a good hotel.",2,2022,09,11
120,Worth the Visit,"From the first step into the hotel my family (myself, husband, daughter (10), and son (3)) were greeted with warmth and friendliness from the staff.
By the end of our stay, some of the staff knew us by our names. 
The lobby, seating area, elevators, OXBO and the Distillery were all very clean. 
For the North Americans like myself who have now become accustomed to the lacklustre quality of service we receive in Canada and the US (since COVID), by not having our rooms cleaned, or dirty garbage bins lining the hallway, that is NOT the case at Hilton Bankside. Our rooms were cleaned daily and they even had turndown services in the evening. Their staff did an immaculate job in cleaning. I can’t stress how much that meant to me, especially having a 3 year old. 
The only issue we had while we were there was that our room keys kept on being deactivated. It was a huge inconvenience to go to guest services every time to get it fixed, but it wasn’t something that ruined our stay by any means.
The food at breakfast was delightful, many options to choose from, but something for everyone.
There are express grocery stores all around within a 30 seconds walk from the hotel. Taxis and Uber are all accessible. 
The closet activity/site is the Tate Modern, which is about 5 mins walk. Everything is walkable, or you can take the tube to see other sites.  Waterloo station is the closest station (approximately 15-20 mins).
A huge shout out to Daniel, doorman, he went above and beyond to make us feel welcomed! Whenever he was working he greeted us every time we came or left. He gave us recommendations for restaurants and sites. He was exceptional! 
The concierge, our kids absolutely loved the fox treasure hunt, and the little prizes are so cute.
I would 100% recommend booking here.",5,2022,09,11
120,Fantastic stay. Highly recommend.,"Wonderful service from the moment I entered the door. A friendly welcome. My loyalty status recognised.  Very relaxing, especially in the executive lounge. The breakfast has a vast selection. I can’t really fault my stay at all. Hope to visit again.",5,2022,09,08
120,Great stay at Hilton London Bankside,"Had a great stay at the Hilton London Bankside while traveling to London from New York for work. Wonderful location, modern amenities, and excellent service. Daniel the doorman was especially friendly and helpful, and made sure we were well taken care of!",5,2022,09,08
120,Delightful Daniel,"Delightful Daniel, we had a great stay. Fab hot, great rooms and love the turning down service to my room.
Daniel us a lovely helpful doorman - A real delight.
Breakfast was lovely too. Would recommend. Great location for southbank access xx",5,2022,09,06
120,Fantastic all round,"From start to finish it’s was a wonderful stay. From checking in with the doorman, to checking out. The small touch’s of turn down when returning to the room. Checking out Daniel the doorman was very helpful and attentive. 
Look forward to staying again.",5,2022,09,06
120,Weekend stay,"Excellent hotel, clean and well presented. Rooms a good size. Great staff - very helpfull. Good location, close to transport links, although we walked to the attractions we wanted to see.
Definately recommended.",5,2022,09,04
120,"Good location, Friendly staff but otherwise average.","The Bankside is very well located for the south bank, Tate, and bridges to walk over to St Paul’s for instance. Also, a pleasant walk along to the Eye and Westminster. In this regard it’s very good, but there are Premier Inns and other options right in that area. It’s not so great for Covent Gdn, Oxford St and area like those. One way streets also add to traffic and it’s a bit more difficult for taxis to get to for this reason. Inside, we found a pleasant reception space and some thoughtful elements like sweets and water for kids. We weren’t offered the Prosecco on arrival yet others were. I’m not sure why not but it’s not clear how they select customers for this welcome; leaving others to feel a little less welcomed. The family room actually means two adjoining rooms so you’re not quite together but equally not an issue. One negative is that you don’t quite get enough soap and towels for 4 people and the housekeeping didn’t oblige in providing more when asked. Not a major request for 5 star rated hotel and it doesn’t really feel 5 star. Breakfast buffet is self service and one can order eggs. The selection is reasonably diverse to cater for most. The hot food is ok but not quite the same as when you order off a menu. Drinks are also self service so one does need to walk about to gather everything. In terms of value, we would say it’s overpriced for the offering but London seems to be busy enough for hotels not to care. We all know prices are rising so it’s not unexpected but it’s not worth that In real terms.",3,2022,09,03
120,"Excellent Service, Room and Breakfast","In 2021 I stayed three nights and enjoyed it so much I booked again this year for a much longer stay. The service is consistently professional, courteous and helpful, comparable to that of a luxury property. The rooms are clean, modern and very thoughtfully designed with conveniences and comforts. I especially like the large Roman style shower with rainshower head and separate wand. There is always good water pressure,  quiet and efficient A/C, and reliable WiFi. The bed and linens are extremely comfortable and conducive to sound sleep. The breakfast buffet is huge and includes everything you would expect, and the quality is good. It includes cooked-to-order eggs, all the elements of a full British breakfast, pastries, breads, a cold bar with yogurt, fruit, deli meats and chesse, and too much more to mention here. My only nit is that coffee is available only from self-serve machines and sometimes you have a short wait to use them.  I plan to return again next year.",5,2022,09,01
120,Attentive service and so friendly,"Wonderful evening with such attentive service from Melania and Yen in the Executive Lounge at Bankside. Nothing was too much trouble, they were both so kind and helpful with my 8 year old son
Highly recommended so Thank you ladies !",5,2022,09,01
120,Great Visit to London,"Was able to secure a family room at the Hilton Bankside through the help of their reservations manager. Our flight got into London earlier than expected (a rareity I know) and the front desk staff worked very hard to get us into at least one of the rooms so we could freshen up. We stayed for over a week and the complementary waters/soft drinks along with the wine/truffles they left for us were a great touch. Our rate included breakfast and the restaurant did a nice job of accomodating - there was a nice option of items and it did not feel as though it was 'mass produced'. 

The only item I had some issues with was the concierge desk, I understand many of them were new to the area and were very willing to help but I would suggest that they start getting out and connecting with the multitude of restaurants and events in the area to offer a better service to the guests.",5,2022,09,01
120,Oh that breakfast...,"In London, I wasn't expecting a breakfast to be anything special.  Sure, some UK style bacon and eggs, maybe some pastries and pancakes... but this breakfast was simply incredible.

Paired with large, clean rooms and AC that stood up well to the sweltering 92 degree days, we loved this hotel.

The Lounge only had drinks most all day.  We would have loved some more nosh mid day but it was a welcome treat when we came back from a day of touring.

Showers were great!  Bed, super comfy!

Location, not so bad.  Only 6 minutes from the Southwark tube and about 10 minutes from the Globe Theater.  

It is a restaurant desert.  Well there are restaurants but non that are amazing.  The Amazon Fresh on the corner was a really welcome surprise!  Perfect for snacks at reasonable cost.

Staff was wonderful too, especially Maria in the restaurant. BTW, don't forget to tip at breakfast even is it is ""free"" because of your status or room.  The staff works hard to keep things spotless.  Thank them appropriately...",5,2022,09,01
120,Buisness meeting.,Had a very enjoyable stay.Staff were helpful and polite.Had dinner here.It was most enjoyable. Breakfast was excellent. The hotel is central to what I required.The room was comfortable with plenty of towels etc.When I am in the Capital next I will stay there.,4,2022,08,31
120,Sehr komfortabel und gemütlich,"Very nice hotel, great ambience and good location, we felt very comfortable.
 The staff tried very hard to take care of every matter, thank you very much.  Special praise goes to the staff from the lounge Melania & Yen, the food was always fresh, delicious and always plentiful.  We have always been treated very well and attentively.
 Dear concierge, many thanks again for the cup and the loving care, our little son was very happy.",5,2022,08,29
120,Great London alternative,"We had a great stay as always here at Hilton Bankside Hotel. 

Location is fantastic, service is impeccable - Daniel the doorman went above and beyond! Helpful and always happy. 
Service with a smile 😊 which makes your day. 

Thank you again for making our stays with you brilliant!!",5,2022,08,28
120,Excellent stay,"Really good experience with nice and helpful staffs - Daniel doormen for example helped with the luggages. 
The bedroom was clean and comfortable 
The included breakfast offered a variety of items
The online checkin via the app seems to be still work in progress",5,2022,08,27
120,Hospitality at its Finest,"If you’re planning a trip to London and want the best in service, this could be your hotel of choice! My wife and I just had the most wonderful stay at Hilton London Bankside and can’t wait to come back!",5,2022,08,24
120,Always Amazing,"Great hotel - impeccable service and attention to detail. Great location and family friendly, but its the staff that make the place. Special shout out to Yen Ly and Melania for their great service on this trip. And to Ms Kim at check-in - thank you! Wouldn't stay anywhere else in London!",5,2022,08,24
120,"Great location, friendly staff &  getaway","We love this Hilton hotel in London, we have stayed in a few different Hiltons but love this one. Great  location, atmosphere & friendly staff. The breakfast is the best & so is the Exec lounge, Melania & Sofia couldn't do enough to assist and make our visit memorable.
Will definitely be back soon.",5,2022,08,23
120,Very good London Hilton,"Having stayed at this property several times previously but not for a while I was looking forward to returning.

I was not disappointed, staff were all friendly and helpful and it was good to stay again.  The lounge is a good size and nice place to work, certainly feels a step up from most lounges at Hiltons in London.

The pool area was also very nice and a good temperature to enjoy a swim and relax.

Breakfast was better than I remembered, good selection and fresh eggs station.

Overall I would happily return and thr fact it is close to Blackfriars Train Station (tube is over the bridge so a little further) and also not far from Southwark tube for the Jubilee line means it has excellent connections to.

An excellent Hilton that is certainly better than most if not all in London.",5,2022,08,23
120,Breath of fresh air,"From arrival to checking out thoroughly enjoyed the whole experience.
The staff were superb & always service with a smile. Met with a glass of lovely Prosecco at reception when booking in. 

The room was very spacious - extremely comfortable bed. Shower was the best ever experienced, of the countless many hotels stayed around the world.
Bath towels that were plenty big enough, thick & fluffy too. 

The swimming pool was a welcome bonus !  Tried & tested for an afternoon swim. 

The bar made some great cocktails & the buffet breakfast was a delight- you want for nothing- all wants & wishes catered for. 

Great location for the nearby borough market & other London Bridge attractions.
Noticed very clean area & plenty of eateries & drinking holes nearby.",5,2022,08,21
120,Good reasonably priced choice in heart of London ,Good location. Nice room. Comfortable bed. Decent setup for working in room.  Decent sized room for London. Restaurant was good. Staff was friendly. Location made getting a cab tricky during peak times. Neighborhood is mixed with some residential so 2 grocery stores/ markets nearby which was handy. ,5,2022,08,20
120,They saved our holiday!,"We were originally booked at the Royal Horseguards (see my disastrous review) and moved to the Hilton London Bankside after we’d already arrived in town. While it’s not as close to as many historic landmarks, it was the perfect spot for us:
- very clean room/bathroom 
- ample size and lots of storage
- very nice staff happy to answer any question
- right next door to a Costa and a Sainsbury, and a few blocks from Amazon Fresh, lots of pubs, restaurants - everything you may need 
- easy walk to the tube, although we primarily used the Gett app and taxis (it was VERY hot)
- room service was fast and the breakfast service included with our room in the restaurant was terrific
- Air conditioning!!!! Again - it was VERY hot
- very quiet, we were never woken up by street noise of any kind 
- environmental program in place to reduce water waste 

This hotel checked every box and was a terrific home base for the week. Added bonus for art lovers - it’s 3 blocks from the Tate Modern.",5,2022,08,19
120,great stay on all counts,"I had not been to this side of London for years.  This Hilton is beautiful.  Everything about it was wonderful.  The rooms were nicely equipped and the bed very comfortable.  The staff could not be more helpful.  Daniel, the doorman, really looked after us the whole stay, for which we thank him.",5,2022,08,19
120,Hilton Bankside continues to deliver,"it's been a year since we last visited the Hilton Bankside but all the staff and management have continued their wonderful service and standard's Exec lounge is brilliant as ever, both Melania and Yen have looked after my us and all the guests in the Executive Lounge to the highest standards. Well done Hilton Bankside! Thank you for a wonderful stay😃😃",5,2022,08,17
120,A cosy hotel beautiful rooms comfortable beds and friendly staff,The hotel is cosy but beautiful staff are friendly and helpful. Room sizes are decent and room vibe is good. Breakfast is good and with a decent verity to select from I totally recommend this hotel for families ,4,2022,08,16
120,An excellent stay!,"My wife and I recently visited London and chose to stay at the Hilton Bankside. Great location so close to Museum and great restaurants including Borough Market- check it out. Nasser took great care of us upon check in- thanks Nasser! The entire staff of the Hilton Bankside shows care and attentiveness, you don't see that every day. ",5,2022,08,15
120,"Stayed here for 10 days in May, 2022",I stayed at the Hilton Bankside during a Trafalgar Tour of London. I loved the hotel. The breakfast was fabulous with lots of choices. The room had comfortable bedding and the bathroom had a walk in shower with a waterfall faucet. One of the valets who was so kind and helpful to me was Tomasz. He helped me with my luggage and always greeted me with a smile. The hotel was near two small grocery stores and two ATM machines with no fees. There were several nice restaurants and French cafes with in walking distance. I would highly recommend the Hilton Bankside Hotel the next time you are in London.,5,2022,08,14
120,A gem of a hotel,Amazing staff and very clean room. Massive thanks to all the staff who make this hotel amazing. Will be back without doubt nothing was too much trouble. Big shout out to reception staff who notice you and help within seconds,5,2022,08,14
120,Nice hotel,"We had two connecting rooms for the family. The rooms were very comfortable.
The location of the hotel was very good. 5 minute walk to Waterloo tube station.
The breakfast was good. The chefs make omelettes and pancakes.
Very quiet and clean rooms.
TATE modern is just around the corner.
Lots of small grocery stores next to the hotel if you like a snack in your room.
Kettle in room for tea or just hot water for noodles.
The pool is ok, small, but does the job.
Special thanks to the staff.
Overall a good hotel.

Same to finnish:
Meillä oli kaksi yhdistettävää huonetta perheelle. Huoneet olivat erittäin mukavia.
Hotellin sijainti oli erittäin hyvä. 5 minuutin kävelymatka Waterloon metroasemalle.
Aamiainen oli hyvä. Kokit valmistavat munakkaita ja pannukakkuja.
Erittäin hiljaiset ja siistit huoneet.
TATE moderni on aivan nurkan takana.
Paljon pieniä ruokakauppoja hotellin vieressä, jos pidät välipalasta huoneessasi.
Vedenkeitin huoneessa teetä tai vain kuumaa vettä nuudeleita varten.
Allas on ok, pieni, mutta tekee työnsä.
Erityiset kiitokset henkilökunnalle.
Kaiken kaikkiaan hyvä hotelli.",5,2022,08,14
120,Amazing hotel and customer service!,Highly recommended. This hotel is high-classed and consistent with all the other good reviews. The place is modern and comfy. The breakfast is classy and delicious. Specifically wanna call out the excellent customer service and care offered by the staff at the front desk. They are very friendly and helpful. Would stay with this hotel again in the future!,5,2022,08,14
120,Highly recommend,"Excellent experience for a family wedding. Joseph from the concierge was fantastic he met our every need and super friendly. Highly recommend the hotel for a stay in London , pool was lovely and kid friendly and the rooms were great and very clean.",5,2022,08,14
120,"Fabulous, including for families with younger children","Beautifully kept: 5 mins. from Southwark tube (or also from riverboat). Very close to the Globe theatre, and also to many restaurants and small supermarkets for snacks.
Small but lovely indoor pool with very long opening hours to start and end day.
Breakfast is in a lovely spacious dining room and the food was excellent.
Lobby area again gorgeous - sweet trolley for kids, ""fruity"" water, etc.
Bar also open-plan and welcoming.
Special shout-out for Leandro on reception: very pleasant and helpful.
We'll be back!",5,2022,08,14
120,Fantastic stay!!,Fantastic Hotel! From check in to breakfast to the bar and doormen….Everyone that works at this hotel is amazing! Daniel the doorman went down the street out of his way to get us a taxi. We actually canceled a hotel that we had booked to stay longer at the Bankside.,5,2022,08,12
120,Summer trip 2022,"This is a very good hotel, very modern and clean. We really enjoyed the location. Relatively easy tube access and convenient with some small groceries nearby for snacks and sundries and close to the Thames path which is lively and great in the summer. We had a family room which is almost like 2 adjoining rooms. One small snafu is that I thought the second room would have 2 beds, not 1. We made do, but just fyi that they have both kinds of family rooms and you aren’t guaranteed one or the other. That wasn’t apparent when I booked. Breakfast was included with Hilton status and was extremely pleasant.",4,2022,08,11
120,"Excellent Hotel in the city, delicious breakfast.","Major attractions close by, Blackfriars station  and bus 381 gets you everywhere. Hotel itself is quiet, the view in some rooms is however quite disappointing. Breakfast is perfect andpersonal is very nice",5,2022,08,10
120,Great hotel,"I stayed two nights for a business trip. Room was new, clean and very comfortable. What made the trip is Alessandra's help. I came in late the day before I was scheduled to leave, and she helped schedule my wake up call and ordered a taxi for me the next morning. The wake up call and taxi were right on time, and made the beginning of my travel day go extra smoothly. I was so thankful for her help.",5,2022,08,10
120,Super and efficient attention to guest request,Alessandra was brilliant in resolving the room change that was made earlier in the day. Even though I return back late evening she managed the request efficiently. Well done. It has been a super stay at this gem of a hotel where every encounter with the team has been a delight.,5,2022,08,09
120,"Great location, clean but service lacking","We were a three generation family occupying three rooms (two inter leading and one King). I chose this hotel because of its advertising re being family friendly. My grandchildren received none of the perks described in other reviews - no stuffed animal, special welcome, robes or slippers. I had to ask for the stuffed animals, which were delivered the following day. We never met the famous Daniel the doorman. Service was brusque and hurried. 
That being said, this was a clean, new, quite adequate Hilton. Breakfasts provided a full array of choices. The hotel is very well located for sightseeing, and a ten minute walk from the tube station. It is opposite the Tate modern, and close to the Southwalk river front. Borough Market is 0.6 miles away. There are four grocery stores with a few blocks. The room has a refrigerator and a kettle and coffee machine.
I would stay here again for the location and cleanliness, not for  the service.",4,2022,08,09
120,Amazing Birthday,"I visited Hilton on the 1st of August to celebrate my birthday and was greeted by two lovely members of staff, Jeongbeen and Leandro. I give my details and also told them I was here to celebrate my birthday, upon hearing this Leonardo was very accommodating and upgraded our room. This came as a lovely surprise and really made the my birthday memorable. 
We we’re able to use all the facilities and even lounge by the pool. 
We will definitely be visiting again very soon. 
Thank Hilton team",5,2022,08,09
120,Great Hilton property in London,"Enjoyed an excellent 4 night stay at the Hilton Bankside. The hotel was great and service first class throughout.

We stayed in interconnecting rooms which had plenty of space for our family of 4. The hotel reached out before we arrived to ask about the ages of our kids - and when we arrived there were kids robes and slippers in the room, as well as some kid friendly blankets and pillows. Really nice touch.

Breakfast in the hotel was excellent. Wide variety of hot and cold food, all very tasty. Service always quick and friendly.

If you are diamond there is access to the exec lounge which is open all day for coffee/soft drinks; and then between 6-8 there are cocktails and snacks. The staff were so friendly and accommodating- always made sure we got a last drink before closing!

The pool is great if you need a break from sightseeing- especially when travelling with kids! They loved it.",5,2022,08,08
120,Excellent relaxing stay would definitely return!,"Excellent hotel, lovely reception and restaurants. Recommend the Executive rooms. I took my son for his 12th birthday and we are now Hilton all the way!! Good good, staff friendly and highly recommend. Location good too. We had an executive twin room. Access to lounge which is well worth it. I had originally an issue with my room but it was swiftly resolved.",5,2022,08,08
120,"Great location, great service","I stayed at the Hilton Bankside during august as a diamond member. The location was great and the executive lounge food, wine and service was excellent. Yen Xiong Ly’s in the lounge was very attentive and made the lounge experience very enjoyable! Thank you Hilton Bankside.",5,2022,08,04
120,"Superb Hotel, Sets the gold standard for the premium hotel experience in London","· This is our third time at this hotel, we have tried a variety of luxury/upper market hotels in London but none of them compare to Hilton Bankside.
- The rooms are big, shower area is big compared to many others.
- Breakfast is superb with a wide selection in the Oxbo restaurant. The scrambled egg is amazing. This was the first time we tried the freshly made pancakes/waffles and they are delicious!
- All of the staff at this hotel always seem to be extra helpful. A few special mentions, Firstly Daniel the Doorman is always incredibly helpful. Whether its assisting with information, getting prosecco or water. Daniel is a credit to the hotel. Also a big thankyou to night manager Anthony, Our air con stopped working at midnight, we rang reception. An engineer was there within minutes, when they realised it was a bigger issue and couldn't be fixed there and then we were moved to an alternative room. But due to the time Anthony was kind enough to let us leave our stuff in the original room whilst sleeping in another.
- The hotel was also occupying many Kpop celebrities during our visit, this didn't impact on our stay at all. The staff were obviously attentive to the Kpop stars but this didnt defer them from the other guests. It was actually a surreal experience.
- Solid internet throughout.
- Housekeeping were superb too along with reception. Any requests such as extra coffee, biscuits, shower gel etc were all delivered within minutes.
- The Mojito cocktail from the Distillery bar was also delicious!",5,2022,08,04
120,Simply The Best!,"Let me start by saying we have stayed in the Hilton Bankside before and enjoyed it very much.  This time we in London to gather up 35 Americans and take them via bus to my daughter's wedding in a different part of England. In total we had I believe 12 rooms in the hotel as people came to London to visit prior to the wedding. We decided to stay here because of past visit and location.  Best thing we could have done.  The hotel is beautiful.  Rooms nice, well air conditioned and since we were there for the highest recorded temperature ever in London a big Bonus. Breakfast is great, bar a lot of fun and the location incredible. We had the Penthouse for the last two nights which was an incredible experience in itself. That is not what makes the Hilton Bankside simply the best, it is the staff. The hotel staff went above beyond for us at every turn. helping us get a bus to transport to the wedding, cabs, directions special arrangements for rooms even care for one of our group who had covid. Front desk clerks, John the concierge, door men, bar staff the Hotel Manager all could not have been more welcoming, hospitable and warm. We go to London at least once year, have stayed in other hotels and there are lots of good ones. We will never stay in another hotel in London besides the Hilton Bankside. It is truly simply the best hotel in London!

120,Excellent stay and wonderful doorman,"I traveled with son and wife to London for a summer break, stayed at Hilton London Bankside for the second time. This time fell more like being in second home once we arrived. Daniel Doormen was quick to lead us to settle down in the executive lounge (we are not entitled to ) since our room is not ready. His enthusiasm of his job were very impressive and motivated me to leave this review. Waitress Melanie at the lounge really care what she does and settled us very well. So from the moment we met Daniel and later being taken care by Melanie, we felt like being home. Will definitely recommend family to stay here.

120,How Diamond should be done,"We arrived at Bankside having booked a brand new Hilton property located 5 minutes away that hadn't worked out.

What a contrast. A warm greeting from the doorman and help with luggage as we emerged from our taxi.  

At check in we were upgraded to a junior suite.  This room turned out to be a little disappointing as it was dark.  I called down to reception and was helped by the reception manager Natasha who immediately understood what I was talking about and instantly fixed the problem.  She personally met us at the replacement room 2 minutes later.  Excellent customer service of the highest level.

We loved the service in the Executive lounge (especially from Sophie).  Breakfast was great too.

And as a result of this, we extended for a further 3 nights.  We stayed in the same upgraded room at the same rate without any issue.

Pool was 17m and great for some exercise.  Gym was very small with not much to offer other than cardio.

Reception was a bit hit and miss when not dealing with Natasha and there was one ""funny"" incident. Breakfast included filtered water in glass bottles.  I much prefer this to bottled water for the obvious environmental and cost reasons.  I took 2 mottles to my room on day 1  with no problem.  On day 2 I took another 2 bottles but the receptionist tried to stop me.  I reassured her I wasn't ""stealing"" the bottles but 10 minutes later the hotels head of security arrived at my door to insist I had to give the bottles back.  He was extremely polite and professional and insisted that he'd replace them with regular bottled water.  I declined and explained it was exactly because this wasn't bottled water that I wanted it.  He looked a little sheepish and politely accepted my reassurance that I would return the empty bottles and off he went.  I asked to speak to hotel manager but heard nothing.

I tracked down Raoul later that afternoon.  And told him my funny experience about how his head of security had looked slightly embarrassed to be at my door insisting I give back some bottles.  He too seemed somewhat surprised at how this had occurred.  His handling of it was also a truly ""diamond"" experience.

I wish all Hilton experiences lived up to the excellent service that is provided by Bankside.  I'm sure I'll return.",5,2022,07,31
120,Great staff,"In all of our travels we have never stayed in a hotel that every member of the staff was friendly and cared. From the front desk staff, to the concierge staff, to the bar and restaurant staff, to the doorman that greeted you, to the housekeeping staff. A special shout to Kamaal and Yan, who always had a smile on their face, and wanted to know if we needed anything else. The room was great, morning breakfast was a large buffet, anything you wanted. Hilton honors free drinks and appetizers at night. Location was perfect for us as we are walkers, meaning we could walk to Big Ben, Parliament  Building, Windsor Castle, Buckingham Palace, London Bridge. Good place to eat in the area as well. Highly recommended this hotel. Have fun",5,2022,07,29
120,Wonderful hotel,"We stayed here for three nights in a family interconnected room (one king, two twins) for our family of four. It was a great set up and we had plenty of space. As Diamond members, we had lounge access which was truly a bonus as we enjoyed the access to tea, coffee, and cold drinks throughout the day as well as the evening cocktails.

The staff was great and went out of their way to be helpful. The hotel was clean and the breakfast was overall very good, too. Easy to get to Tate Modern, many restaurants, easy walk to many other sights as well as public transportation. The hotel is definitely a great value!",5,2022,07,28
120,Perfect hotel in a great location!,"Excellent all around:  friendly and helpful staff, modern/updated interior, great breakfast in the morning, nice drinks in the afternoon.  Very convenient location for exploring the attractions of that part of town:  the Tate, the Globe, Borough market, the Tower Bridge…",5,2022,07,28
120,One of the Best Hotels we've stayed at!,"The Hilton London Bankside Hotel is very well located, just a few minutes from the Southwark and London Bridge underground stations, as well as being close to many options close to restaurants, cafes, markets and mini-markets and various tourist attractions such as the London Eye, Borough Market, Tate Modern, The Shard, Shakespeare Globe, among others. 
The entire team and structure are amazing, with a restaurant and lounge worthy of royalty, we were very well attended by all the staff and throughout our stay they really made us feel like kings and queens. 
Among the excellent staff members we have had contact with since our arrival, we make a point of mentioning by name: The Great Daniel ""Doorman"", Mr. Tomasz, Mr. Joseph, and ""Sir"" John Kortenray (Doormen/Concierges); Natasha, Henrique, Martyna, J.B. (Reception); Melania, Sofia, Kadiatu Conteh (Lounge); Pangiota, Ana, Isabela, Elena, Iloae, Ariel, Kira, Kadja, Cailan, Joshua, Ms. Shanti and Chefs Ali and Daniel and all of the Breakfast team; from Miro and Olivia from Room Service and forgive us if we forgot someone, but everyone on the Team deserves a 1000 !! We were also very pleased with the option we made for a Suite room and we also take the opportunity to thank the daily maintenance and cleaning of the apartment made by all the excellent Room Maintenance and Cleaning Team, the breakfast (breakfast) one of the best that We have already expired: excellent and complete, cleanliness and quality of the room and sleep, the bathroom and all the products available, all of the highest quality, in addition to the decoration of excellent taste. 
We hope to return and once again, thank you very much from the Mauad Family: Livia, Ana Julia and Alexandre.",5,2022,07,25
120,Great service in the Executive Lounge,I have stayed at the Hilton Bankside many times over the years for business and leisure. It is mg go to hotel in London. As a Hilton Diamond member I get access to the Executive Lounge. Normally it is more self service but on my recent 6 night stay there were lounge attendants who served wine and cocktails. Sophia remembered my wine preference every night and was always ready with a glass of Chardonnay when I arrived. Yen Xiong Ly had the best personality and was so attentive to my needs. She would come check on me periodically and top off my wine. Both of these ladies made my sty memorable and once again prove why the Hilton Bankside is my favorite hotel.,5,2022,07,23
120,Amazing Service,"Had some issues with checking upon arrival,  but thanks to Alessandra and Natasha (who were extremely helpful and responsive), things were resolved smoothly and we received the package we had signed up for. Incredible location, very modern and comfortable!",5,2022,07,22
120,"Great recommendation, great stay, great staff!",Loved this hotel.  Location is excellent and the staff are all welcoming and friendly.  Facilities are excellent and superbly well maintained.  Would strongly recommend. Oh and thanks to Daniel for the cool waters on a hot day!,5,2022,07,21
120,Good hotel (mostly),"One of the better London Hiltons & has excellent amenities - most staff very lovely & helpful especially in the restaurant and exec lounge but some of the reception staff try to be nice and say things which they think guests want to hear - just be honest please and follow through with what you say!

Some excellent employees though & big shout out to Daniel the doorman who was very helpful and highly professional - always a pleasure to see him.",4,2022,07,21
120,Another pleasant stay,"The bankside is a home from home - lost count how many nights i have stayed here over the last few years, but always a joy to come back to . The executive lounge is excellent and being attended to by Yen Xuong Ly is always a delight. I always enjoy my stay here and Yen always is excellent and happy! Love the hotel, best hilton ive stayed in and ive a stayed in alot",5,2022,07,20
120,HILTON BANKSIDE REVIEW,"Had a great stay here ! The staff went above and beyond to make sure we were well taken care off ! 
Special shout out to Yen Xuong Ly who served us for a few nights in the executive lounge and went out of her way to make sure we had everything we needed !!",5,2022,07,20
120,Good Family Stay in Interconnecting Rooms,"We were in rooms 315 and 316 - they are a set of interconnecting rooms at the end of the corridor on floor # 3

The hotel is located in Southwark which is across the river from the usual London touristy things like Big Ben etc

The hotel location is good enough with an accessible tube station at Southwark. The staff is friendly enough and the hotel has all the basic amenities one would expect from a Hilton - they have a universal charging port in the room as well as multiple USB charging points in the room which is such a relief because UK adaptors are different from India and if one does not have the adapters, device charging can be a problem

Breakfast buffet was included in our package - they start the service at 630AM and it is friendly and accomodating to allergies which my wife has

Only grouse with the hotel - in the bathrooms, the bathtubs are unreasonably high and difficult to climb into without some sort of a stool which was not provided - every bath time, one hoped and prayed one would get into and out of the bath without mishap",4,2022,07,20
120,Good way to keep cool in central London in summer.,"Great pool in the basement for relaxing swim at the end of the day. 
If you are in the Exec lounge, Yen Xuong Ly is lovely and will look after you very well. She was extra patient with my two young children also - thank you!",5,2022,07,19
120,"Brilliant hotel - comfortable beds, great breakfast options and relaxing executive lounge","Have stayed at the Hilton Bankside for a few weeks due to work engagements and have been well looked after, particularly in the Executive Lounge. Nothing is too much trouble, lovely staff - I don’t know everyone’s name yet (I’ll come back to update if I can) but Yen Xuong Ly was brilliant and always made sure my Prosecco flute was full ☺️",5,2022,07,19
120,First choice hotel for London,"I really rate this hotel highly. The hotel itself is immaculate, modern and with great facilities. The rooms are very comfortable with plenty of amenities.
Breakfast has a great selection with quality ingredients and the chefs will make omelettes/eggs to your liking.
I used the executive lounge and the service was excellent. A standout member of staff was Yen Xuong Ly who was particularly attentive.
I always try to stay at this hotel when travelling to London.",5,2022,07,19
120,"Business Lounge - Sofia, Melania & Yen","I regularly stay at the Bankside Hilton and the facilities are first rate. The check-in process is smooth with room upgrades provided when available. The guys in the business lounge, Melania & Yen are good value. The service is attentive but not in a way that is obtrusive and they certainly treat the regulars well!  
Thank you guys.... and look forward to seeing you next week.",5,2022,07,19
120,"Hilton Bankside, London","Really enjoyed our stay- great location- beautiful hotel. The staff always  very friendly,  professional, courteous, and helpful- especially Daniel at the door! He was always more than happy to hail us a cab and went out of his way to greet us and chat. Great staff overall, we will definitely be back! 

-Scott Richards",5,2022,07,19
120,Enjoyable Stay,"I was a little concerned about this hotels location during booking but once there it was perfect. It’s in a less busy area and an easy walk to the river near the Globe theater. Either direction takes you to the Tower of London or the London Eye.
The included breakfast is one of the best, prepared omelettes and pancakes to order. ",5,2022,07,18
120,Great hotel,"Fantastic hotel and staff. Thanks Daniel and the other doorman for lifting my giant bags.
Super cool hipster area just over bridge by Tate museum and nice walk to borough market or go over bridge to west end.",5,2022,07,18
120,Shocking customer service!,"I mistakenly booked our room for the wrong day Friday instead of Saturday and so on the morning of our stay I realised this and quickly made a call to the hotel to explain I had made a mistake and to see if anything could be done to rectify this. I was put through to the bankside reservations team who seemed very helpful and said it would not be a problem, i was told from (Nasser) that our reservation would be moved to the next day. I doubled checked this with Nasser and confirmed I could just arrive on the Saturday to check in. I was willing to pay the difference of the 2 nights to fix the issue but I was told it would not be a problem to move it.
I arrived on the Saturday with my Wife and all our luggage. The lady at the front desk said our reservation did not exist and we could not move it. The manager came out and was quite blunt with us and said he could do nothing to move the reservation, he said he would look into it but just disappeared and I left us standing around with the front desk lady for over 20 mins. He did not come back and just hid in his office.

We then proceeded to asked how much for the night and the response was £450 which was outrageous for hotel which normally in advance costs £150-200 per night. The issue i have is we arrived with our luggage expecting a room from the advice of their own reservation staff and they took no reasonability for the fact their staff had given use the wrong information. At the very least they could offer us a room at a sensible rate. I am a Hilton gold member and regular visitor to the Bankside hotel with my wife and clients. I am completely shocked at the way we was treated with no sympathy or apology for their own staff actions and no help to sort out the issue.

I will never stay at this hotel again and I will be moving my loyalty to another hotel chain as it is clear Hilton do not care about their clients well being.",1,2022,07,18
120,enjoyed my stay here,joseph was very friendly and welcoming when we arrived and any questions we had at anytime he would always help us out. He always suggested good locations and got out of his way to help us. the concierge staff were also very friendly and constsntly willing to help with any issues or questions that we had.,5,2022,07,17
120,London holiday,Joseph was amazing from the first day he opened the taxi door. Knows the area very well. When asked for recommendations he was quick to offer suggestions. Great bloke to have a chat with. Told us how to stay safe and all the tips you need to know for tourism which was very much appreciated.,5,2022,07,17
120,Awesome hospitality,"Had a very good hospitality during my stay here in Hilton London Bankside for a week. Most of the tourist attractions is very near from this place. Special Thanks to Daniel Doorman, He is brilliant!! 

Will definitely prefer to stay here during my future visits!",5,2022,07,17
120,Great service and stay,Wonderful service and stay here at Hilton bankside. Daniel Doorman was very helpful and loved his kindness and willingness to help. Breakfast was average. Overall it was a very nice experience and would like to stay here again.,5,2022,07,17
120,Worth The Money,"This is a spectacular hotel.  The location is perfect with lots to do in Bankside, but very easy to walk or commute to the sites in London Proper.

The hotel looks brand new.  The rooms are spacious, with high end toiletries and accessories.  It is not common for outlets to be placed in bathrooms, so having an outlet near a mirror outside the bathroom earns additional points from this traveler. Not many hotels offer a turn down service, so that was a nice surprise as well.

Only one small complaint.  We had a room with a bathtub/shower combination.  It was difficult getting in/out of the shower because of the height of the tub.  Be prepared to step up or down approximately 2.5 ft/.78m when getting in or out of the shower.  There is a hand rail on the wall for assistance.

The entire hotel is clean and the service was exceptional.  We were greeted with a glass of Prosecco upon arriving and my daughters were given a few sweets.  Not sure if that's  Hilton Honors perk, but it was wonderful.

It's a bit pricey, but worth the money.  I highly recommend this for any couple, family, or traveler looking for a top notch hotel.",5,2022,07,16
120,Location was superb!,I collaborated with Hilton London Bankside for a one-night stay and was very pleased with my experience. The lobby was warm and welcoming and the reception was very kind. My favorite part of the hotel was its location. Bankside is SUCH a neat area. You are right next to the Tate Modern Museum and Borough Market. I highly recommend walking along the river during sunset! I recommend The Distillery for drinks— they have lots of gin options and lots of fun cocktails to choose from.,5,2022,07,14
120,Beautiful and clean hotel. Excellent service.,"This hotel is super clean with comfortable beds with all the amenities you come to expect from a Hilton. Breakfast is delicious too. Rooms were spacious.   Everything we can possibly need. As far as location, it’s not in the center of things, but we walked to the Buckinghan Palace in about 45-minutes (stopping at gardens along the way) and took a cab back.  About a 30-minute taxi cab drive from the airport, in the middle of the day. Highly recommend this hotel.",5,2022,07,12
120,Great Customer Care,"Fabulous weekend at this hotel.  Lovely check in , great rooms,excellent service and lots Of little extras from turn down service to sweets on a trolley.. A special
Thanks to doorman Daniel who looked
After us and went over and above to ensure our well-being.  We’ll be back.",5,2022,07,10
120,INCOMPETENT WITH FOOD ALLERGIES,"Our family break was ruined by the hotels complete incompetence in dealing with food allergies. The hotel boasts of having a vegan bedroom suite, however the chef can not show his face to discuss making a suitable meal free from milk and egg for a child. Staff are clueless with regards to allergies and the hotel manager thought it was appropriate to send a very sarcastic email detailing how many times I had complained about it all. Wake up Hilton Bankside…Ignorance to allergies costs lives.",1,2022,07,09
120,Excellent hotel (especially with children),"We have just finished our stay here with our 3 year old. Hotel and staff were fantastic, the small touches like the fox cuddly toy and colouring at breakfast for our daughter made the stay all the better. The rooms were clean and well kept, my husband and daughter enjoyed the swimming pool & the selection at breakfast was outstanding (special mention for the waffles!). Thank you for a lovely stay!",5,2022,07,09
120,Daniel the doorman was an excellent server,"When arriving in the hotel, Daniel was nothing less than welcoming. He greeted us with Prosecco, briefed us about our rooms, and said he’ll help us with anything we need in which he did! This is by far the best experience we have had at any hotel!",5,2022,07,09
120,The Hilton London Bankside,"I stayed for a long period of time at the Hilton London bankside. I chose this
Location on a recommendation and it was close to the office (near the Shard). My family came to London and met me. The hotel was situated near the tate modern and borough market. Joseph our doorman was excellent. He was new and helped me with all of my questions. One day, he was doorman and bell boy and did everything with a smile. He helped me navigate timings to Heathrow and the railway. John our concierge was also knowledgeable and helpful (what to do and where to go and landmarks to look for). I would highly recommend the Hilton London bankside.",5,2022,07,09
120,Best Hilton Hotel I have ever stayed at!,This hotel has the best service I have ever experienced!  Hands down I would stay here again and highly recommend this hotel to others.  I have stayed a many Hilton Hotels thru the years but none had service like this! The restaurant on site are exceptional and the location was excellent!,5,2022,07,05
120,A good breakfast.,"The best scrambled eggs I’ve had even compared to other Hilton’s. 
Moist, not too runny and certainly not hard and dried out. 
Thinking about breakfasts, even the bacon wasn’t overdone and tough. 
Thanks to Daniel Norty, the chef responsible.",5,2022,07,04
120,Excellent stay,Just returned home from a fantastic 3 night stay at the Hilton Bankside- rooms are very comfortable with great bathrooms and facilities- food in the bar was excellent as was breakfast each morning.  All staff members went above and beyond in offering first class service.  Undoubtedly one of the best Hilton’s we have experienced,5,2022,07,03
120,Best Hilton stay ever,"As a diamond I stay over 100+ nights each year at so many Hilton properties in the US and The Hilton London Bankside exceeded all of my expectations. The staff  from the doorman, to the front desk to housekeeping were phenomenal and responsive to every need or question. I thought the hotel location was excellent as we could walk to many sites and we always no more than a 10 minute Uber ride away from other sites.

The breakfast  choices were great and the executive lounge always had  something good  each night.

I wish US Hilton properties could emulate the true guest experience the staff at Bankside offer and provide.",5,2022,07,03
120,Sunday Brunch,"We had a lovely time, enjoying great food, great atmosphere and Xaverie and her  colleagues to look after us!
Cava is top quality!
Highly recommended if you want to spend an amazing time with friends and family!",5,2022,07,03
120,Best-in-class luxury Hilton hotel experience,"I have stayed over 100 nights in Hilton hotels in the last year, and my numerous stays at Hilton London Bankside have been some of the best to date, continuing to impress me every time.

This property is undoubtedly a real gem in the Hilton portfolio in London, with a combination of truly exceptional staff who make every effort to go above and beyond to satisfy guests, excellent facilties including the best indoor heated pool, and a great hard product in all of the rooms. It all starts with a warm welcome from the Concierge team!

Particular thanks to Leandro, Chinuqui and Ewelina who are truly excellent professional team members and represent the best of Hilton hospitality globally based on my many stays as a Hilton Diamond member.

You will never regret choosing to stay at Hilton London Bankside in central London, it is extremely well connected with Southwark and Waterloo Tube stations a short walk away, and walking distance to many tourist attractions including the Tate Modern and the London Eye.

Pro tip: order the pancakes at breakfast, they are fluffy and mouthwateringly delicious 😋",5,2022,07,02
120,Excellent visit!,Our stay at the Hilton Bankside was excellent and we were so grateful to have Daniel the Doorman help us. He was so gracious and welcoming and even went out of his way one night to help us get a cab on a busy night.,5,2022,07,02
120,Great hotel. Excellent location. Friendly staff.,"Location
It's a block behind the Tate Modern and the riverwalk. It's a five minute walk to the Globe and a 15-20 minute walk to the Tower of London. It's also close to Tube stops. It's about a 20 minute walk to the London Eye. There are plenty of restaurants and two grocery stores (inc Amazon Fresh) nearby.

Entrance
Very friendly staff greeted us and walked us in.

Check In
Was quick and friendly. They have several attendants. We arrived around 10a from th US so our room wasn't ready. But they got us one by about 1pm and texted us. We had to check in again but it was fast.

Room
Room was clean, modern and large. Had all the appointments of a new Hilton.

Breakfast
Free and large buffet that includes omelets, fresh pastries, fresh juice and 30 or more items.

Issue
The only issue we had was that the front desk manager would not give us change for paper notes. They are legal tender until September, but they refused to give us change which we would have used for tips.

Wifi
Was fast and free.

Conclusion
Excellent place to stay to see London.",5,2022,06,30
120,Best hotel Best location,"This hotel was just perfect! We had never stayed on Southbank before this trip, but now would not stay anywhere else. The location is right where you want to be in London. The hotel staff were all especially friendly and helpful. The doorman Joseph went beyond expectations to make sure we had everything we needed. The food was very good in the breakfast room as well as bar area.",5,2022,06,29
120,Great service @ Exective lounge,"Wonderful executive lounge, especially Ms Yen Xuong Ly. Very attentive and professional service by her which made our stay at the Hilton London Bankside much more enjoyable. Great hotel and location. And the executive lounge is a great place to rewind after a long day of sightseeing. Will surely stay here again.",5,2022,06,29
120,Excellent customer service and great location,"Had a lovely night at the Hilton Bankside in London between flights. Great location - the Tate modern is steps away and St. Paul’s just across the river. Joseph and Tomasz at concierge, and Martyna at reception were all amazing. Nothing was too much trouble, and they supplied directions, umbrellas, help with luggage and general support in ways that went well above what I expected. Six stars for these three! A solid omelette at the buffet topped off the experience. Will definitely stay again when next in town.",5,2022,06,27
120,Best Hotel Experience Ever!,"Third time is a charm! We had to rebooked this hotel twice because of covid but the wait was worth it. First of all, the staff is incredible…everyone! Upon arrival we were told we were upgraded because of our diamond status; we rarely get that in the states. Our room was beautiful and so comfortable. We had booked an executive lounge room and I am so glad we did. It included a delicious breakfast each morning, beverages throughout the day and a wonderful hot meal at night. We were so tired in the evenings so returning to the executive  lounge to unwind and eat a bite was just perfect. The location is great. We did a lot of walking but found we could walk to almost anything we wanted to see.  I just can’t say enough about how wonderful our five night stay was. We are already planning a trip next spring and will only stay at the Hilton  Bankside London. Kudos to the entire staff and management!",5,2022,06,26
120,Terrible!,"Do not book this hotel! Not ever! My flight was canceled due to a mechanical issue, I was issued a credit for the hotel. I was tired and exhausted and booked the same reservation twice at the Hilton Bankside. The reservation was made the same day as the stay. Clearly a mistake! They will cancel the reservation but change the entire room rate. No accommodation or forgiveness. Their words, “our policy is our policy, you should have been more careful.”  Imagine after spending. 7 hours at Heathrow trying to get home with two kids, this is what I experienced.  They are awful and greedy!",1,2022,06,26
120,"Great location, Great doorman","After 2 weeks in Italy, my husband and I ended up spending another 12 nights in London.  We have stayed at this hotel 2 other times in the last 5 years.  They are well located, have an indoor pool and well appointed rooms.  This time the doorman Daniel really helped make our trip enjoyable.  On the days he was there he always greeted us and made us feel especially welcome.",5,2022,06,24
120,Service,"A very enjoyable stay and made to feel welcome by all staff especially Daniel the doorman, he goes above and beyond to make you feel special whenever we saw him, 
Very good room and breakfast would definitely recommend it",5,2022,06,22
120,Could be better,"Beautiful hotel, friendly staff especially the concierge at checkin and the house keeping staff, fairly spacious rooms, we loved using the pool facilities and the hotel is just a few minutes away from attractions. 

Cons:

-Mistake was made with our charges calculation which meant that £191.30 extra was charged. Thankfully I spotted this out and the receptionist was apologetic and they said that they would refund the money when I check out. It’s been 2 days since I checked out and no refund received yet.
-lack of attention to details when cleaning. There were marks all over the board of the bed, and there was also dirty socks behind the curtains which my child had gotten hold of and put in her mouth. Thankfully I discovered this quickly. Again, the management were apologetic and offered complimentary breakfast.
-we requested for double bed but we were given twin beds which was posed a risk to a young child who fell down from the bed.",3,2022,06,22
120,Jersey Bob,The Bell Man start the stay with a hardy welcome and they are truly are at your service.  Breakfast is a 10 don't miss out.  The executive lounge is tops and the gym is better than most hotels.  We've been twice and this is our go to spot for center city London. ,5,2022,06,22
120,My Mothers 70th birthday,"The day/night had to be perfect. All the preparation to make it right begun with choosing a suitable hotel. Being a diamond member I stay in various Hilton/Conrad hotels all over the world. 

Hilton Bankside is my favourite for adults in London. Seeing as I had arranged childcare for the special occasion, Bankside it was!!!!! 

I called up and spoke to Chinuqui. I explained the reason for my booking and I was so overwhelmed by the friendly, helpful and outstanding customer service I received. Nothing was to much. She went above and beyond to help me with any questions I had. I was really hoping we would meet when we checked in. 

The special day finally came and we arrived at the hotel. The porters were straight out to help with our bags and show us to reception. I was greeted with a big smile and little did I know it was Chinuqui on the front desk. She is such a ray of sunshine. By the way, there is a sweet station you help yourself to, what a lovely touch. 

As it was midweek and I’m a diamond member we were very lucky to get an upgrade which was such a lovely surprise. Chinuqui even escorted us personally to the room (which was stunning). I am So grateful that was arranged along with a delicious cake in the room. 

Lounge access is really worth paying more for the executive room . The food, drinks and service are just amazing. Thank you so much to Anna, Thomas, Yen and Kadiatu who really looked after us. You really helped make my Mothers birthday more memorable. Time went so quickly as we had so much fun. 

We had a great nights sleep as the beds are to die for. Went for an early morning swim and followed by a phenomenal breakfast which we truly enjoyed. All staff are really helpful. 

The quality of the hotel/rooms/food/lounge/gym/swimming pool is top class. I really do recommend staying here. The location is so central so lots to do and see in walking distance. 

If I could rewind time I would definitely do it all over again. 

Thank you Hilton Bankside for making my Mums birthday so special. We definitely won’t forget it. Can’t wait to return again soon.

Special thank you to Chinuqui. I hope you are recognised for your outstanding customer service. Hilton Bankside are lucky to have you. 

Forward planning but we are hoping to return for new year. Can’t think of anywhere else we’d rather be to see the new year in. 

Thank you so much :-)",5,2022,06,20
120,We've already booked again,"It was our second stay at the Bankside, we booked a King Junior Suite with lounge access this time.    We we greeted by Joseph and to my suprise he remembered us from our previous visit,  even so far as to remember the car we drove in. That was a really nice touch,  it made us feel special.  The lounge was a lovely addition,  the food was tasty and the drinks were free from 6-8. Sofia was very attentive and was always around if you needed anything.  The location of the hotel is superb, and we have already booked again for July.  Thanks also to Daniel,  the doorman and Alessandra for going above and beyond and making the stay that little bit more special.  Thoroughly recommend this hotel.  ",5,2022,06,20
120,Hilton London Bankside,"Everything about our experience here was exceptional! The location, accommodations, service, staff, restaurants, experiences and overall ambiance exceeded every expectation. Daniel, the magnificent bellman was a highlight of each day, he’s quite remarkable. 
We HIGHLY recommend staying here for any travel needs.",5,2022,06,19
120,Miro to the rescue!,"Miro was brilliant and very professional and helpful.  

Our additional selection pack wasn’t upto scratch no fault of Miro.  Miro resolved the problem and was extremely nice and apologetic and listened and insisted to correct the the issue at hand.  And he did, thank you for making our stay at Hilton great.",5,2022,06,18
120,Hilton Bankside London,"Had a great visit to London. 
Must say a lot of it is due to the Hilton Bankside 
The staff is absolutely fantastic 
Yen Xuing Ly in the service area was a wonderful host.  And couldn’t be more appreciative of her efforts during my visit 

Thanks again Hilton !!",5,2022,06,14
120,Hilton - Bankside - A Bland World,"In a bland world or repetition and meaningless platitudes, it is refreshing to spend time in a  hotel where the staff actually remember your name and go out of their way to support and assist.  

From the front of house to the back office staff.    But I have to call out a special mention to Ali Asgar Onally - the chef -  who always remembers peoples names and what they like.   The Hilton Bankside would not be the Bankside without Ali.

London is a busy place and competition is high.   Writing this review I wonder if I am just letting others into a little known gem...

120,Hilton Bankside,"Daniel Doormen was so helpful throughout the stay, always going out of his way to help and make life easier with our luggage, ideas on what to do around the area. I hope Hilton Bankside appreciates him as much as we did! :)",5,2022,06,13
120,Sabrina is AMAZING!,"Amazing front of house, funny, helpful- Sabrina gave me all the information I needed to make my stay seamless and enjoyable… overall the start of my stay fantastic because Sabrina took the time to be so thorough! Thank you! Xx",5,2022,06,13
120,Great service at the Hilton Southbank,"Huge thanks to Daniel the door man for his award winning smile, gorgeous blue eyes didn’t hurt and what a gentleman! Thank you so much ! Couldn’t have asked for better service. Hilton Southbank is the best !",5,2022,06,12
120,Spacious quiet rooms in a great London location,"Having stayed at a nearby hotel for years when visiting London on business, I'm kicking myself that I didn't find this hotel earlier.  First, the rooms are quiet at night - a big plus for a light sleeper like me.  And they are spacious.  Not the cramped rooms I am used to in London.  The front desk staff is very friendly, professional and helpful.  I spent a relaxing cocktail hour one night catching up on work at the bar which has 100 gins on the menu. Wow!  Then there is the location which is near Waterloo and Southwark stations and right behind the Tate Modern.  Definitely my go to hotel in London going forward.",5,2022,06,12
120,Brilliant stay at Hilton Bankside,We stayed for three nights at Hilton Bankside and we were made so welcome by the friendly staff. Our room was lovely and clean and the hotel has a great location. A special mention goes to Daniel the doorman who assisted us in the pouring rain to get a taxi. He provided umbrellas for us and was so helpful in getting us a taxi during a busy time. He gave us a friendly greeting every time we returned to the hotel and he made our stay a very pleasant one. We will definitely be returning to this hotel again!,5,2022,06,12
120,Our second home!,"It’s our fifth visit in the last year - and we wouldn’t change this hotel - everyone and everything is MAGNIFICENT! 
Location is fabulous! 
Perfectly managed and staffed! 
Breakfast is always amazing…
However - the night manager Anthony needs a special word of commendation as he is fantastic at turning very difficult situations ( system glitches) into a pleasure!!!!
And Daniel the doorman always greets you with a smile and humour! 
After living away from London for almost 20 years - I can honestly say this is my second home! 
Thankyou all for making our visits to London extra special…",5,2022,06,12
120,Great hotel,"Everything about this hotel shouts quality.
The design is stunning, the staff exceptional (particularly the young lady in the bar who made an amazing coffee, and kept us stocked up with Pinot and popcorn), the rooms are luxurious , and the breakfast delicious.",5,2022,06,11
120,Check in is a joke,Need a Physical Credit Card to Check. What a joke. I could prove the card was mine. I had Apple Pay and they refused to accept it. The receptionist said it was for security reasons but they would debit my credit card if I didn’t check in. Hilton it’s 2022 not 1975!,1,2022,06,11
120,First Time in London,"Everyone at the hotel has been wonderful. Daniel the Doorman was excellent! He was super helpful and accommodating. The hotel is beautiful, clean, and in close proximity of everything. I highly recommended this hotel.",5,2022,06,11
120,Fantastic long weekend!,"Really enjoyed our four day weekend in London! As ever, well looked after by the Hilton Bankside team. A special mention for James (General Manager), Ali (chef), John (concierge) and Alessandra (reception). Thank you",5,2022,06,10
120,Average,"The staff were amazing with my 8 year old daughter but the room was below average for a 5* hotel. The Pool was not child friendly, there was no mini bar and our view was a wall. The restaurant was very accommodating and great waiters",3,2022,06,09
120,Hilton quality and good place to stay in London downtown,"Friendly team, giving sens of being valued as diamond member. Personalised service from front desk, concierge to Lounge. Feeling as being recognised and served as a well known client. 
Friendly and personalised service from Yen Xuong Ly in the lounge",5,2022,06,08
120,Back in the London smoke with a friendly and welcoming Hilton.,Natasha delivered awesome Customer focus and leadership and is a true asset to the Hilton brand. I always stay at this Hilton when I’m in London. Unfortunately there was a communication barrier between the individual checking me in and myself. Luckily Natasha was on hand to resolve the challenging check in process.  The property remains of the highest standard and staff are thoroughly engaged and very friendly.  The bell staff and concierge were very helpful throughout my stay.  The breakfast remains one of my favorites. The independently run restaurant on the property was not particularly welcoming and so I decided to dine elsewhere outside of breakfast.,4,2022,06,06
120,An excellent 3 night stay over Jubilee Holiday,"The hotel is in an ideal situation if you want to be close to tube and visitor attractions without the normal noise of London. It is a 5 minute walk to Southwalk tube and 10 minutes to Bankside Uber Clipper boat service. The Tate Modern is 2 minutes away with lots of local shops and pubs nearby. With St Pauls and the City of London a 10 minute walk away across the Millennium Bridge
We stayed in an Executive room and requested a quiet room which it was overlooking an outside area area away from the  road. The room was very well appointed with robes and slippers provided. The mini bar contained complimentary soft drinks which were appreciated. Especially the bottled water in plastic bottles so you could take it out each day. The only down point was the rooms lighting looked good but didn't give a good light at night.
The breakfasts each morning were excellent with a wide choice to select from, with eggs, pancakes and waffles cooked fresh to order.
We had access to the Executive lounge with tea, coffee etc available all day, happy hour offered alcoholic drinks and some hot food. It was a little chaotic at this time due to school holidays and some families using it as an opportunity to feed the family for free, however at other times it was very relaxing.
What made the place were the staff, all who we encountered were professional, friendly and helpful.
It is certainty an hotel we would stay at again if visiting London.",5,2022,06,06
120,Really great London hotel,"A really lovely base for exploring London. Bankside is such a great area. It’s peaceful and quiet and yet so close to all the best bits of London. 
The pool is fantastic. The rooms are well designed. Beds comfortable. Nice and quiet. 
The executive lounge is brilliant. 

Thanks to Leandro at reception for being so helpful too.",5,2022,06,06
120,Five star hotel in London!,"Excellent hotel.  We booked interconnecting rooms which were perfect for us. Large, modern with little extras like robes and teddies for our children.  We used the pool quite a few times over our stay and it was one of the nicest hotel pools we’ve used - very clean, quiet and a big hit with our kids.  Breakfast was lovely, fab selection and very good quality. Only charged for adults which made it very good value.  
Very easy location too, the area was quiet and has several little convenience shops like Amazon Fresh within a minute walk. 
Highly recommend this hotel for a stay in London.",5,2022,06,06
120,Don't hesitate to choose Hilton Bankside!,"Family visit to London over Jubilee weekend.
Wonderful stay at Hilton Bankside in king deluxe & adjacent king rooms. Very comfy beds, quiet rooms & spacious modern bathrooms.  Lovely to have the use of the exec lounge for morning coffee! Also used gym & pool, which were meticulously clean & well kept. 
Every member of team were friendly,  professional & helpful & a credit to Hilton Hotels.
Special thanks goes to Yohan for such a warm welcome upon check in.  Thanks also to Joseph for the swift taxi ensuring we arrived at the station in time, Leandro who made check out a breeze and all the house keeping staff.  Would recommend to anyone looking for a 5* Central London Hotel,  with pool, gym.",5,2022,06,05
120,Lovely!,"Wonderful hotel! We stayed here for an entire week, in the family suite. We were with our 16 and 13 year olds, so this room set up was perfect! It has a connected king room with its own bathroom and a room with two twin beds with its own bathroom. The hotel is stylish, up to date, and impeccably clean. Shout out to the cleaning team because they were fabulous! It’s been a long time since I’ve been impressed with the cleanliness of a Hilton and it was so appreciated. All of the staff was extremely friendly. The location of the hotel is not the best, I’d call it a transitional area. If you are in London for business in the area, then you will love it. If you’re in London purely for touristy stuff, I’d not recommend it. Due to the Jubilee celebrations it was very difficult to get taxis or Ubers to drive there. We were not super comfortable with the tube, especially at night, traveling with our two children. It is really close to Waterloo station so we had no trouble with our day trips to Windsor & Hampton Court. 
Our biggest gripe with the hotel was room service. There were several days where our feet hurt from walking 8-10 miles every day and we just wanted a hot shower and dinner in our room. However, the room service menu is bizarre at best (at least from an American palette). It’s almost as if they tried to make it as weird and disgusting as they could to deter people from wanting to use it. There’s no normal food, except on the kids menu, and even that is difficult. Things like anchovies on toast and foie gras with truffles and sauerkraut. We tried to get them to make us simple cheese flatbreads (without figs and walnuts and mackerel) and they couldn’t. We finally figured out our American Uber Eats account would work and were able to eat that way. Also, as Hilton Diamond members, we’re used to enjoying free breakfast in the executive lounge every day of our vacation. We were surprised to discover this hotel only offers that on Saturdays and Sundays and we had to adjust our schedule (and budget) to accommodate that. Overall a great hotel!",4,2022,06,03
120,Great Hotel in Good Location,"Wonderful hotel in a great location.  Not far from the tube and the Borough Market.   Staff was so friendly and helpful from the moment we arrived.
Bed was always turned down awaiting us at the end of a long day of sightseeing.  Definitely would come back.",5,2022,06,02
120,"Pricey, but Good Choice","The Hilton Bankside is well-located on the South Bank, close to the Globe Theatre and the Tate Modern museum.  Lots of restaurants and activity olong the riverside.  An easy walk or taxi ride to the West End or other tourist locations.
The hotel is new and well-maintained, the staff is professional.  The breakfast is excellent.  The hotel wifi is strong.",5,2022,06,02
120,Let down by computer systems,"Stayed at this hotel for the third time. Great hotel / staff but they double charged me. Pre paid two months before, but due to a computer issue they have recharged me. This was after I checked out, after I got the bill. 

Leaves a bad taste when I have the money pending whilst they sort it out.",1,2022,06,01
120,Hotel that stands out head and shoulders above the others in Central London,"Just returned from another weeks stay at the London Hilton Bankside which is located next to the Tate Modern, the famous ‘Wobbly Bridge’ and the Southbank. Within easy walking distance of London Bridge and the ‘Borough Market’. The location of this hotel was perfect for us as I was working in the City and my wife was enjoying exploring London. We both walked almost everywhere and my wife also used the Underground from Southwark station to visit places like Kew Gardens, Kensington etc. 

Upon arrival at the hotel, we were greeted with glasses off Prosecco which we drank while being checked in. The receptionist could not have been nicer and the sales manager Tom Oliver who I have met many times, had everything set for our arrival. One of the porters, Thomas escorted us with our luggage to our room which was on the fifth floor, spotlessly clean and in a quiet location which we loved. 

Breakfast every day was in the OXBO restaurant  in the hotel managed by Charlie where you can take advantage of the buffet or menu and the chefs are there to cook things for you straight away. I had the pleasure of chef Ali Asgan Onally cook one if the best vegetable omelettes every day! Nothing was too much trouble, Ali was so helpful. Great way to start the day ahead. 

The hotel has an executive lounge which you can access to if you include it with your reservation.  Highly recommend doing this. As well as all day access for soft drinks teas and coffees from 6pm till 8pm there is complimentary food, wine soft drinks etc provided. Sofia and Anna who take care of the guests in the lounge go the extra mile to ensure you enjoy your visit. 

The hotel has an indoor pool, an excellent bar with outdoor patio and one surprise for you, they have beehives on the fourth floor who generate honey for the restaurant. 

If you need a taxi or advice, John Kortenray, head of concierge and his team are always there to help you. 

When its time to check out, there are four receptionists there to help you. Alessandra took care of us on this trip and as you can tell, we were sorry to leave. 

We have been travelling to London for many years and for the quality and value for money, the London Hilton Bankside is always our first choice.",5,2022,05,31
120,Great hotel with everything you need and lovely people,"Sabrina and Chinuqui greeted me upon arrival and checked me in, they were superb and very friendly. They were kind enough to upgrade me as a diamond member to a very nice room which was much appreciated! The doorman Daniel, also very friendly, makes every effort to greet and help guests. Lovely, lovely people. I love the Hilton Bankside and it’s my first choice in London whether on business or for leisure.",5,2022,05,30
120,.,Daniel doorman has provided Amazing service really happy person and very enjoyable to talk to looking after the guests very well highlly recomend because of him it made my stay in Hilton hotel more enjoyable as was greater with happy personality and professionalism upon arrival,5,2022,05,30
120,Return visit and still love it here,"We have stayed in this hotel 5 times now and after staying in other London hotels I don’t think we would want to stay elsewhere. Especially when travelling with children. 

The staff are so friendly and really make an effort with the children which is really lovely. Yesterday my 4 year old son was dressed as spiderman and was convinced he was going to get stopped for photos and the man on the front desk was more than happy to ask for his photo - absolutely making my sons day!!! I really hope the Hilton recognise the staff they have at this hotel as they are always so helpful, professional and friendly from concierge to cleaners.
The kitchen staff making the pancakes and eggs always greet you with a big smile and nothing seems too much trouble.

We had connecting rooms 357 and 358 - corner rooms which we always request as the lay out is perfect for us as a family of 6, you get a small foyer when have them connecting, which is really handy for shoe storage and suitcases. T comes with exec lounge access which is really good, with soft drinks, tea, coffee and hot choc all day. The evening meal was really nice I ate a few bits and the mini puddings where especially nice!
The only thing I find slightly lacking is the storage for clothes when you have 6 if you have less people it is more than adequate. It just needs a small set of drawers or the suitcase area to be shelved off maybe… 
The pool is a great extra to have and the children used it most days, it is always clean and usually fairly quiet.

Area wise it is in a quieter area with loads of nice restaurants close by and close to borough market.
It is easy walking distance to London eye , shard, Tower of London etc. Buckingham palace etc are a bit far to walk with small children but taxis are between £15-20",5,2022,05,30
120,Great rooms in central London,"Great hotel with decent room size and services. Helpful staff … especially Anna in the executive lounge who really stood out as helpful and charismatic. 

Next time would prefer better Wi-Fi. 

Thanks very much for providing a lovely base for an awesome weekend",5,2022,05,29
120,Great time in Bankside,"Super Hilton, great service with Joseph who gets a five star review,  everyone was so helpful and it’s a great location for Borough Market and the Tate Modern.  Easy walk over the wobbly bridge to St Paul’s and beyond. Lovely suite and super exec lounge. Second stay will be back again.",5,2022,05,29
120,What a find!!!,"Wow wow wow. What a find!!! 
Fabulous food, great selection and my glass was NEVER empty. Wasn’t rushed off the table and all the staff were super friendly and polite. Had the most attentive service from Annamarie and Tina, could not ask for anything more!! Can not recommend enough!!",5,2022,05,29
120,"Fantastic hotel, lovely staff, perfect location","We only stayed 1 night - really wish it was more! Perfect location for us beware south bank and the tube. Hotel adjoining rooms were immaculate and a great size. Loved the foxes on the kids beds. The breakfast had a huge range, coffee could have been better, but that is the only minor negative I could find. Staff were friendly, helpful and very attentive. The pool and gym were perfect for our family and the kids loved the sweets on reception. Wouldn’t hesitate to stay again.",5,2022,05,28
120,Joseph is Super!,"Joseph was tremendous during our entire stay. He met us on arrival and took incredible care to get the our family and all of our luggage into the hotel and our room.  During our stay he was kind, helpful and great with the kids.  He went the extra mile to get us a taxi for the family and all our bags when Uber bailed on us.  Thanks for making our stay a great one Joseph!",5,2022,05,28
120,Rooms good; OXO restaurant needs new staff,"Stayed here for 3 nights on business.

Rooms:  A
Robes, decent amenities, quiet and roomy.  Bed was a bit hard for my liking but I slept well so can't complain.   I didn't have a view but you don't need one and this hotel is on a side street so not much to see.

Location:  B-
It's about half mile walk to the nearest subway stop and more near business offices than anything else.   While London requires a mix of walking and subway, this hotel is a bit tucked out of the way. But Ubers picked up here no problem.  

Gym:   B
A few treadmills and weights. Big indoor pool which I didn't use though.

Staff:  Everyone but the restaurant- A.  OXO restaurant- F
Bellmen were friendly and helpful, as were the concierge and front desk. OXO restaurant though needs an overhaul. Showed up for brunch and asked for table of 1. Restaurant was two-third empty.  Asked if I had reservation I said no.  Said I needed to make a reservation online to be seated.  I asked why I couldn't be seated since the place was empty at 1 pm on a Sunday!   Calls over her manager who brings out the menu to ""explain"" it to me and all it has to offer and that they are more for groups.  So I go ""so are you telling me I shouldn't eat here?"" She goes, ""no, just explaining the way it will be"". So strange. Like I just wanted brunch.  They were rude and dismissive and I walked out and went somewhere else.   then ate here a few days later with coworkers for weekday breakfast. No one came by to help us at all, and when you asked for drinks they pointed to the corner to get it ourselves.    Had to flag down someone for help.  Looked at us like they couldn't be bothered and were annoyed.  Hire all new staff at OXO.",4,2022,05,27
120,Attention to details amazing!,"Joseph was an incredibly friendly and helpful bell captain.  He and  the rest of the staff were extremely helpful and friendly. The breakfast was incredible, too.    This. Is a wonderful place to stay while in London.",5,2022,05,27
120,The way they treat and talk to visitors,Daniel Doorman was the best actually and i’ll book at the same hotel next time i visit london he was kind and respectfull always smiling the best face to a hotel greeting and welcoming very happy to book in this hotel,5,2022,05,27
120,Great hotel in an amazing location,"This is a great hotel in a quiet location. The Bankside Hilton is relatively new, modern, with larger room than most European hotels. The bed is comfortable and the bathroom is very large. The location is a very short walking distance to many great and varied food options. The Tate Modern is a block away. The millennium Bridge is located just the other side of the Tate. You can walk 20 minutes to St. Paul's Cathedral. Osborn Pharmacy (covid test for international travel) is a 7 minute walk. Very glad we picked Hilton Bankside as our base location.",5,2022,05,25
120,Excellent hotel. Fantastic breakfast,"I often stay here for work and pleasure. Breakfast is always good and especially Ali Asgar Onally the breakfast chef. Always greets me with a smile and knows exactly what I like. Even if it’s months between visits. Really sets me up for the day. 

Service at the hotel is fabulous. It’s a real hidden gem.",5,2022,05,25
120,Second home,"Love staying at the bankside - have nothing but excellent service from James the GM and his team. Especially appreciate the pool in a morning and the two breakfast chefs including Ali Asgar Onally greet me every morning with a smile, a chat and it starts my morning each week with such a positive note. Thanks all",5,2022,05,24
120,Wonderful London weekend.,"My husband and I spent the weekend at the Hilton Bankside so we could meet up with our son for my Birthday dinner.
Our first night was before our son arrived and we had dinner in the Distillery on Saturday night. The bar was very pleasant, had a good atmosphere and the staff were well trained and made our evening very enjoyable. We were especially well looked after by Domenico. He gave us advice on the food and drinks, was attentive but not intrusive and ensured we enjoyed our experience.
I can highly recommend this hotel and it’s staff",5,2022,05,21
120,Great Stay,"Classy hotel. Modern and lovely rooms, there’s a good supermarket closeby aswell. Tube stops from kings cross not great so u got a taxi for £20 which was easier.  

Great service in the exec lounge with Sofia and Anna - attentive and very personable, good range of drinks available.",5,2022,05,21
120,Great location and great staff. You can’t go wrong staying here.,"Great location in central London. Walking distance to many attractions and convenient to underground and other public transit. 
We enjoyed the executive lounge for nightly drinks and warm light dinner snacks. With breakfast and the nightly lounge, combined with a healthy lunch out, we found that we didn’t require a dinner.
Among the many helpful staff in the lounge was Anna who visited at our table and remembered the drinks we would have. 
We also received gracious service from the concierge desk.
We ordered room service, and while served through Distillery, Megan delivered courteous and prompt service. The food was also good.
Breakfast at the Oxbo was tasty, but some are quite intent that you’re done by 11am, lording over your table until you leave in an awkward manner.
Likewise, a late snack at the Distillery was also awkward near kitchen closing time. We did get our food, but no second round of drinks.",5,2022,05,20
120,Daniel the Great Doorman,"Daniel (Doorman), is very pleasant and a great representative of the Hilton Brand. My stay was 2 weeks and Daniel always greeted me with happiness every morning.  Daniel has vast knowledge of the surrounding area and will help find anything you need.

Thank you
Brandon",5,2022,05,20
120,Fabulous,"From the moment we stepped out of the lift until we left in our lift, the service was fabulous!  Daniel Doorman went above and beyond hailing our lift to the train. Dinner was delicious! The accommodations were superior.",5,2022,05,20
120,Excellent stay as return guest for many times,"Stayed there many times.  A city hotel with both business and family friendly services

Front of house deliver consistent upgrade to diamond member and always send out pre-arrival welcome email which make the service personal.

The staff are all attentive and well resourced which give high staff to guest ratio key to luxury hotel service.  In fact, some of my friends are in law are highly recommended this hotel. 

Executive lounge service sift drinks and wine beer bubbly in evening  ( lots of variety ) and food are also well made so you can actually get stuffed in lounge . They also do cold dishes small canapé and lovely desert too.

Room are well maintained and swimming pool are their sweet spot. Perfect temperature lots of chair and towel in fact not many people.",5,2022,05,19
120,Mr Alan Logan,"Excellent reception and a warm welcome from Alessandra. It’s a particularly lovely room and seems very well appointed. My own concern, my number one issue is a quiet room and the team have achieved that for me. 
I arrived around ten pm and the hotel looks delightful, I am looking forward to breakfast.",5,2022,05,18
120,Breakfast with a smile and a handshake 👍,"Quite simply my favourite Hotel to stay at in the work week  and also when we spend family weekends in London.  A great central, but peaceful part of London and a super slick but homely feel to it. A particular call out to Ali Asgar Onally, who every morning greets me with a smile, a handshake, a friendly conversation and the best omlette around. When away from home it’s these touches that make the difference and keeps me coming back since 2015. Keep it up Ali Asgar Onally 👍",5,2022,05,18
120,Great doorman,"Mr. Daniel is great doorman, very happy to welcome you, and assist with your needs. He noticed that I am running low on water, and immediately pointed out place where I can top it up. Great asset for Hilton hotel.",5,2022,05,18
120,Breakfast Review - Ali Asgar Onally,"Ali has been serving me breakfast in Bankside since 2015.  In fact it’s because of Ali that I come back to Bankside every week for work.  His friendly, kind nature, not to mention his fantastic omelettes and pancakes make a great start to the day!",5,2022,05,18
120,"Awesome bar service  - they know their stuff, especially Anne, who is just fantastic across every measure!","Great service at the bar in the Hilton Bankside, great attention and service and a fantastic bar staff who really knew the gins and cocktails. I have been going to Hiltons for almost 10 year across the UK and this is by far and away the best i have seen!!. Special call out to Anne who does a mean Classic Champagne Cocktail, an oldie but still a favourite!",5,2022,05,16
120,Perfect Hotel,"Stayed with my family over the weekend here and can not speak highly enough of the staff, the hotel and the location.  Nowhere is cheap nowadays and whilst the cost still stings a bit the overall experience was one that means we will use this hotel as our go-to hotel in London from now on.  We are regular travelers to the city so it's a win-win for everybody.  Well done Hilton Bankside, you've converted us.",5,2022,05,16
120,Not bad but not great at the price,"I am not a great fan of London hotels and over the last 30 years I have stayed in many. On my scale of hotel quality (1-10) I would place the Bankside Hilton as a 7.5 It’s basically a good quality 4 star hotel. It’s better quality than most in the standard Hilton chain but it’s not in the top echelon of hotels like the luxury Hilton range, Shangri-La, Four Seasons etc.

Location is good for access to the London attractions South of the Thames - the Tate Modern, London Eye etc and a short taxi ride to the West End.

We arrived very early and our one bedroom suite was not ready - no problem - the excellent Concierge Daniel popped us into the executive lounge till our room became available (around 12-30) - thank you for that Daniel.

Our suite was quite expensive (£400++) but that’s not unusual for London where room rates are over double, across the range, what we are used to in the Middle East and SE Asia for similar quality. C’est la vie, I’m afraid- you stay London, you pay London.

The room was fine - typically up range Hilton - usual accessories - clean and well serviced. WiFi is good and the air conditioning works well -my only issues with the room were the small windows which make the room rather dark, especially the sitting area - see photograph. Oh yes - and there is no separate bath only a bath shower combo, a sign of space and money saving. The room was excellently served and maintained by housekeeping, by the way.

We ate dinner early in the huge OxBo restaurant which was ok - Olivia was charming but the place was empty - probably because the local area is teeming with good quality eateries where guests can eat well and much more cheaply. The food was ok but nothing special. And the restaurant closes for lunch/ Dinner at the weekend to allow for boozy brunches so best to eat out as internal options are very limited at that time.
Breakfast in OxBo was standard stuff - buffet and egg station - hot plates (well done) hot plates are often overlooked. Pity there were no available toothpicks though - I had something stuck in my tooth and was told “sorry - we don’t provide toothpicks” um… well…

The large but rather dark Executive Lounge is on the ground floor next to the OxBo restaurant - it’s large and soft drinks and coffee etc are available ….there is an evening happy hour from 6pm. That’s a popular occasion - as they usually are when free booze is available - it’s good quality too, by the way.

The Concierge service and front of house staff are excellent - so very helpful on every front - thanks to all of you. Receptionists, especially Sabrina, were excellent.Pity about no newspapers to the rooms in the morning though!

We did not use the other facilities like to indoor pool so I cannot comment.

That’s about it- I’m not a great fan of Hilton Hotels- I find them a bit dark, tinny and joyless - they could do with a bit more brightness and attention to bring a more upmarket image. This one is a lot better than most Hiltons I used to stay in but deserted when I discovered better alternative chains. Would I stay there again? Maybe - but probably not in this price range of room.",3,2022,05,16
120,Great Hilton Experience,"This is my 3rd time at the property and it's getting better with each stay because I discover more of the area and the staff is beginning to recognize me since the stays have all been in 2022 - not sure that is a good thing. Another reviewer mentioned low light and that was my experience the first time, but there was never a sunny day and the window was small. This time the window was much larger and faced the sun so there has been plenty of light and not just on sunny days. I had a problem with the fridge the first day and had bought salads from the local M&S Foods, but they replaced it within 30 minutes of calling.

The Executive Lounge is well stocked if you need anything during the day and the evening cocktails and lights snacks always had plenty of fresh vegetables. I have used the gym quite often and always clean with all machines working, towels, bottles of water and sanitizers to clean your machine and hands. BTW - the Oxbow restaurant for breakfast is awesome - lots of food options! This is not your standard hotel breakfast buffet.

I'm sure the hotel management has recognized that I've been staying often since I've had 3 small gifts delivered to my room - fresh fruit on Day 1, a Bankside ""fox"" coffee cup on Day 3 or 4 and a bankside Hilton tote bag on Day 6 that I could have used earlier since I visited the Borough Food Market earlier in the day.

I will absolutely stay here again and would recommend this to other business travelers because of the location to trains, grocery stores and restaurants.",5,2022,05,15
120,Daniel the Doorman was fantastic,Big shoutout to the doorman at the Hilton London Bankside was the epitome of a professional!  From the time we checked in to our cab leaving he was always there to assist. Ever hotel should have a Daniel. Thank you sir for making our stay amazing.,5,2022,05,14
120,Weekend in London with my son,I went to London for an extended weekend with my son and we had a blast. The hotel was awesome with very good service.  Everything was better than I expected and the food was amazingly good! The whole staff were excellent but in particular Joseph and Maria. Thank you so much for making this a totally enjoyable experience for both me and my son.,4,2022,05,13
120,Great stay,"Typical Hilton with all you need. Good location near to Tate museum and St, Paul church, 5 min walk from the underground station (Jublee line). We booked an executive room which was spacious. The minibar was full with complementary snacks and soft drinks. The lounge was open 7 a.m till 10 p.m, and light good dinner was served 6 p.m till 8 p.m. Excellent Gym. Helpful staff. Tasty breakfast. Special thanks are due to Ms. Maria, front office manager, for the warm hospitality. We look forward to come back!",5,2022,05,13
120,couple of major caveats,"The positives:  good wifi for work, everything in good working order, enjoyable location if you like being a block from the Thames and Tate modern, restaurants, grocery and coffee shops.  Room is spacious for London, bed, bedding, towels, housekeeping, kettle, mirrors, shower, storage space, pool, fitness room, lockers/changing, quiet neighborhood at night, friendly and helpful Hilton employees are unassailable.  Still, not a 5 star experience.  4 star business hotel when you don't expect to use the room much.

The caveats?  

The very low level of light in the room and bathroom is hugely problematic.  Very budget hotel experience.

The blow dryer cannot be plugged in-  in the bathroom.  Bent over in front of the TV reflection?  Bent over even further in front of a small mirror on the desk?  

Combine the low light which causes a few problems and the blow dryer situation and I'm afraid I wouldn't stay here if you care about your appearance.  Standing in front of the window using the phone to check yourself is the best you can do.",4,2022,05,12
120,Almost Perfect!,"Bankside is a hip, clean, contemporary hotel.  Great bar (with 100 gins), food, executive lounge, comfortable beds, quiet location.  What's missing?  Don't expect historic London views.  However, for me, the fact that the hotel was located away from the major tourist areas was a plus.   Second, the room was dark.  Let's get some brighter, dimmable bulbs so the ""dramatic"" look can be optional.  Finally, in my king Junior Suite, the TV was unviewable from the sitting area.  Unforgiveable, but easily corrected if the management installs a swivel tv mount!  All considered, there is so much to like about this hotel, I'd easily stay here again.",5,2022,05,10
120,Weekend in London with family & friends,"An interesting hotel in what was supposed to be a 5 star experience. The hotel was lovely but nothing like other 5 star hotels that I have previously stayed in. The King size rooms were smaller than I expected for the money paid, the swimming pool was a highlight although the edges at water level need cleaning to remove the scum and body fat mark. Changing facilities and rest areas were very good as were the housekeeping team. 
Breakfast was plentiful but cost £20 per head on the day but was only £15 if booked on line. The waiting team were all very young and in some cases inexperienced and if asked a question were like rabbits in headlights. Overall it was a good experience but more so because of other events that we did over the weekend. The hotel facilities did not encourage you to remain in the hotel - hence why we went out to find an alternative venue for breakfast on day 2.",4,2022,05,09
120,Short and Sweet,"Not much to say, just want to quickly give praise to concierges Kamaal and Joseph, who went out of their way to be polite, kind and welcoming. Their effort was notably greater than that of their colleagues, and I feel they should be commended for it. Another lovely character was the chef of Ghanaian descent who was making waffles at breakfast on the day I’m writing this review. I sadly didn’t get his name, but his kind and gentle conversations with our 9 y/o child warmed my heart. 

Thank you to them for making our stay.",4,2022,05,08
120,bad first impression is hard to overcome,"This was our visit to this hotel and it got off to a bad start.  To be fair, we arrived just before the Easter weekend so the hotel was very busy.  We were exhausted due to international flight with an elderly mom in tow and inquired about early check in if at all possible.  The lady was not at all welcoming and exhibited no empathy whatsoever.  The lobby was packed and we could not even find seating for everyone in our party.  We waited and waited.  When we finally got the rooms, they were very disappointing.  The rooms looked right out to a wall.  There was barely any lighting in the room.  When I went back down to the front desk, I overheard another customer complaining about the dark room and was trying to get another room and did not appear to be very successful so I did not even try.   The rooms were otherwise very modern, clean and spacious.  I must say the bed was quite comfortable.   There were a few restaurants around the hotel with couple grocery stores.  Tate Modern is just across the street.   The lady who did the check out was very warm and engaging, which helped redeem the place a bit.  Overall it was a lackluster stay and will not look for a Hilton anytime soon.",3,2022,05,06
120,Your concierge left a big impression on us!,"We thoroughly enjoyed our stay in the beautiful vegan suite in your bankside hotel. Stunningly decorated and excellent value! The staff were all friendly and took great care of us, but the person that left a lasting impression on us right from the start, was your concierge, Joseph! We travel a lot, both for business and pleasure and we have never experienced a concierge who took better care of our luggage. With style, kindness and professionalism. We were traveling with an infant this time - with a lot of small dribs and drabs - and Joseph made everything simple and efficient for us. We were able to start enjoying our weekend right away. A big thank you from us three!",5,2022,05,06
120,Hilton bankside london,We hed a great time and a veary good service frome the hotel and  we like to thank especially to daniel and joseph the doormans who helped us in eny question we hed. It was amazing trip and the hotel make our trip even more fun,5,2022,05,04
120,Excellent Overall!,"I have stayed in this property for an entire week and truly thankful for the wonderful experience. In the beginning, I meant to book my stay at any Amex FHR program properties in London but consistent positive reviews I have read on this property have made me decided to pursue it. And I could not be more pleased with my decision. I am a Hilton Honors Diamond Member as well and Hilton London Bankside is among the very best properties I have stayed in the Hilton group. 

The physical structure of the building and its every facility is very clean and well maintained. The Executive Lounge truly defines what an ideal lounge should be. The staff of the Hilton London Bankside is truly commendable and I wish to thank each and every one of them for their collective effort providing myself superior service and memorable stay. 

Two gentlemen I'd like to compliment further are Daniel and Joseph whom both have greeted, welcomed, and assisted me consistently from the second I have stepped into the hotel until I departed. These gentlemen mind the entrance area of the hotel and indeed have provided that crucial positive first impression when I arrived; a wonderful, friendly, and fun company regardless of the time of the day; and a memorable and cheerful goodbye when I departed. These gentlemen deserve further recognition as they show greater pride and honor in their profession. Much appreciated Daniel and Joseph. Thank you very much indeed. 

I am looking forward to another stay and another overall excellent experience at this hotel.",5,2022,04,29
120,"Hilton, great as always","Very good staff (especially Miss Yen Xuong Ly) and place! Right in Southwark, max 15min from the London Eye and Elizabeth Tower! Really close to an underground station! You can easily understand the tube map, and you can go anywhere, including Heathrow Airport! OveralI, I would really recommend this hotel.",5,2022,04,28
120,Excellent Service,"I had a client staying in this hotel and Daniel the Doorman was of excellent help with any of our needs. Ranging from workspace to concierge, everyone was amazing. I will be back to stay next time. Thanks",5,2022,04,28
120,Excellent Stay,I came here for work and was very impressed with the cleanliness of the hotel and the hospitality of the staff. Especially Daniel the doorman. He was extremely helpful and always going out of his way to help.,5,2022,04,28
120,Great location,"We stayed here for a short trip and loved the area.  Very convenient to London and easy to walk to anywhere in main downtown.   The Tate is across the street, many eating choices and nice river walk close by.   

Thanks to Daniel Doormen at the concierge desk for his help with bags, taxis etc.",4,2022,04,28
120,Nice Hotel…Away From Action…Attentive Staff,"Booked this newer Hilton (2015) for 2 day stay in London. Normally book in busier areas, but gave this hotel a try. 7 minute walk to Southwark tube, but easy use of Ubers/taxis out front. Pub around corner. Amazon Fresh across street as well as a Tesco and Sainsbury.  Nice hotel to chill out. Staff professional and attentive. Daniel (Doorman) very helpful and Concierge staff excellent. Executive Lounge is a plus. Nice bar (OXBO). Would recommend this hotel if you want to experience a low-key area of London.",5,2022,04,27
120,Doorman assistance,"I am currently staying at the Hilton Bankside London. There was an issue with the air in my room, the hotel was very accommodating and moved us to another room. The doorman, Daniel assisted us with the move. Daniel was very prompt, professional and courteous. Daniel quickly moved us and there was little inconvenience. Thank you Daniel and the Bankside staff for a great stay so far.",5,2022,04,25
120,Wonderful hotel for families in central London!!!!,"We just completed a 1-week stay at the Hilton London Bankside. My wife and I have 3 small kids (ages 8, 5 and 2) and this was absolutely an excellent hotel for us. The lobby is beautiful and the indoor swimming pool was a big hit for our kids. The staff was always attentive and went out of their way to accommodate our requests and make our stay as seamless as possible. We only ate breakfast at the hotel one morning, but it was delicious and there were many options for both kids and vegetarians. There were so many little touches that made this hotel kid friendly, from the candy cart near the lobby front desk, to the activity book kits that they handed out at the restaurant, to the pop-up petting zoo they hosted on Easter...and so much more. We had some leftover food from dinner one night and the indoor dining room team was happy to reheat it for us and then bring it back with fresh silverware.

The rooms were immaculate and there was both a morning/afternoon housekeeping service as well as an evening turndown service. We booked a ""family interconnecting room"", which consisted of two bedrooms (both with king beds) and two bathrooms (one with a shower/tub and another with a walk-in standup shower). The location is also great. It's pretty centrally located, so it's not too far from any of the main sites (London Eye, Big Ben, Tower of London, Sea Life, Buckingham Palace, Transportation Museum, London Mail Rail). The only places that were a bit far for us were Hyde Park and the Science Museum, since they are pretty far west. But those sites were well worth the visit.

The staff was excellent. Steven in particular was very helpful in rectifying an issue with how our reservation was made. We had a wonderful visit and would absolutely return to this hotel the next time we return.",5,2022,04,24
120,Trip was great,"The hotel was clean and at a great central location. Great way to do day trips outside London, or to even explore London proper. The staff was professional and very helpful, especially Daniel the doorman who helped us catch a last minute taxi.",5,2022,04,24
120,Our London stay,"Service was great.
Clean rooms. Quiet, delicious breakfast, staff was very accommodating and helpful such as Daniel the doorman.
2 suggestions I have for improvements: 
1) more diversity of the hot plates on the lounge during the weekdays.
2) better lighting in our room.
Thank you for a lovely visit!",5,2022,04,22
120,Fantastic stay,"My family and I had a great eight days at the Hilton London Bankside. Nothing to complain about!!  

Staff, accommodation, location and food were wonderful!!!  Highlights included our suite with executive lounge access, the pool and fantastic breakfast!  We will definitely be back!!!",5,2022,04,21
120,Perfect serving in the hotel,"Daniel the doorman helped us with water, and got us a cab to go to a lunch in the city. Friendly man to talk with. Very helpful for a pleasant stay at the bankside Hilton, he goes an extra mile for a great experience. Thank you Daniel!",5,2022,04,20
120,just smiling...,"It was a perfect trip and a perfect accommodation. One of the many smiling faces in this hotel:  Mr. Joseph, the man at the entrance. He was the first who welcomed us and the last who said goodbye. And in between he was always ready to help. Thank you, Joseph and thank you to all of the staff",5,2022,04,20
120,Joseph provided the exceptional service,"Joseph gave directions to me and my colleagues as to where to go for food and entertainment and he was perfect.
He gave correct directions all the time and always checked if there were better options as well.",5,2022,04,18
120,Sameer,"Excellent  Service, At front desk got greeted and attended by really courteous  young lady named Alessandra. She helped me checkin early which was a blessing after a long overnight flight. Rooms are updated and quite nice.
Overall a great experience.",5,2022,04,18
120,"Modern hotel, large rooms and lovely pool","I stayed here last summer with my teenage daughter. We got connecting rooms as the price had gone down during covid and space from a teenage daughter can be a good thing. One room had a large bath and the other room had a massive walk in shower, so good to have the choice.
The hotel was a bit of a hike each day to wherever we wanted to go, but we got used to it. 
The reception has a modern feel.
Breakfast was very good with lots of choice.
We ate in the restaurant for dinner one night and found limited choices. We struggled to get anything my daughter liked. Room service had better choices for her.
We used the pool (you have to book a slot), which was very nice. Just a couple of other people using it at the same time.
I've stayed in a number of London hotels and this is one of the best for the rooms and the pool facilities. Location a bit out of the way compared to some other hotels. For business I would choose a different hotel for location, but for staying with family, I would definitely stay here again.
PS you can walk around a whole floor via the corridors, so we found timing ourselves running around them fun (sorry!).",4,2022,04,17
120,Trip to London,The hotel is ideally located to travel around London. The hotel is immaculately clean. Rooms are delightful. Pool is ideal. Breakfast was brilliant. The staff were amazing. Special thanks to Daniel and Joseph on the door who were amazing with our kids and very helpful on local knowledge. Had a great stay.,5,2022,04,16
120,Easter holiday trip,"Lovely hotel. Clean rooms, friendly staff. Daniel the door man was always full of energy. Perfect location. Had a family room with two adjoining rooms. Will certainly choose this hotel again. Central for everything.",5,2022,04,14
120,Review,"Hotel was absolutely beautiful and staff were amazing especially the doorman Daniel, He was extremely helpful and generous and we got along fantastic with him. The room was very nice and was a great place to stay for the duration of our trip.",5,2022,04,14
120,Disappointed,I messaged the hotel to ask for an early check in but when I arrived this was not possible which I understand with things at the moment however I was told I’d be called if the room was ready early if not check in would be 3pm.  I arrived back at the hotel just before and told the room was still not available so I waited in reception patiently and agreed with the receptionist Sophia I believe that she’d let me know when it was ready.  I waited for 20 mins and then watched as several guests booked in and received keys so I again joined what was now a reasonable queue to be told my room was now ready. No apology or complimentary drink.  The room was disappointing as I’d booked an interconnecting room for my children but the main bedroom (601) had disabled features which really took away from the luxury element of my star.  Whilst I support and appreciate for these features to look down a toilet with no lid whilst showering  and have red emergency cords and support bars around really took the quality feel away from the room.   I’d mentioned in the message to the hotel it was my 50th birthday no acknowledgement of this or any sort of goodwill.  The wifi in the room did not work.  The hairdryer in the swimming male changing area was faulty with a split in the housing causing a dangerous heat leak.  All round a disappointing experience ,3,2022,04,14
120,"Absolutely superb London hotel, especially for families","For reference, prior to the pandemic, I was a fairly frequent business traveler, but rarely felt strongly enough about a property to leave a review. My family’s recent stay at the Hilton London Bankside, however, was hands-down the best hotel experience that my wife and I can ever remember having, especially when traveling with our children. I cannot say enough good things about this hotel and its staff. The property is beautiful and seems quite new. Location is convenient to public transit, with several good restaurants and small grocery stores just steps away. Rooms are spacious and quiet. The basement pool is great. The extensive buffet-style breakfast is superb and well worth including in your rate. Desk personnel, concierges, housekeeping, and other staff are all pleasant and professional. They really go the extra mile for young travelers, as well, which helped make our kids’ visit to London especially magical. Looking forward to staying at this property again!",5,2022,04,12
120,"Superb London Hotel, special mention for Daniel the Doorman!","This was the second time me and my wife stayed at this Hotel, it was just as good as the first stay. The rooms are spacious with a very comfortable bed. The breakfast whilst pricey is amazing with plenty of selection, including the best scrambled egg I’ve tried! 

All the staff are very polite and attentive but a special mention is required for Daniel the Doorman, he always goes out of his way to assist and made our stay even more pleasant! 

We will definitely be back again when we are in London.",5,2022,04,12
120,Hard to fault,"Very highly recommended, hard to fault. All the staff we encountered were wonderful and we had a great stay. Welcomed on arrival and offered water and sweets for my daughter at check in. Lovely modern, spacious, clean room. Beautiful basement pool, again spotless. Fantastic choice at breakfast, delicious and fresh. Executive Lounge the best we have ever experienced, great food and attentive service. Location is great, easy walk to riverside attractions or to Southwark tube. Would definitely return here.",5,2022,04,12
120,London Hilton Bankside,"Very courteous staff and clean, spacious rooms. The doorman, Daniel greeted me every time with a smile. The turn down at night with a bottled water, music and slippers was a nice touch. Would recommend this hotel!",5,2022,04,12
120,Great hotel super friendly staff,Outstanding customer service and support. From an early check in to always having a friendly smile the team is awesome and so welcoming. Alessandra is brilliant. She was helpful kind and stepped in to handle things. Rooms are lovely and location great.,5,2022,04,12
120,Upmost welcoming,"Always greeted with respect and very helpful. Always smiling and courteous. 
Pleasure to have met you, Daniel and the team at Hilton for making my stay very rememberable. Many thanks! Made our trip enjoyable.",5,2022,04,11
120,"Great service, can’t wait to go back!","We visited the Oxbo restaurant within the Hilton Southwark yesterday and had such a lovely time. Daniel Doorman particularly looked after us well, with great service from start to finish. I can’t wait to go back!",5,2022,04,10
120,Excellent Service,Holiday Inn Bankside is a one of a kind treasure in London. And the service of Daniel the Doorman was truly wonderful. Amazing pool and weight room. Breakfast was spectacular and also a fantastic bar to wind down the day. Would recommend this hotel to anyone.,5,2022,04,09
120,Review Hilton,We had a great interaction with Daniel the doorman. He was very polite and he had a great and proactive attitude to help us. The entire staff is excelent and the atmosphere in the hotel is simply great.,5,2022,04,09
120,Exceptional work from Daniel the doorman,Daniel  the doorman was exceptional he helped when we arrived to put our luggage in the room asked if we wanted a drink and offered the children some sweets that were available. After taking a saunter outside he offered to photograph this is amazing capturing the essence of memories.,5,2022,04,09
120,Great hotel for families.,"Great hotel for a few days stay in London for my birthday with family. All the staff were so friendly and couldn't have been more welcoming to our 2 young children. Fox theme was really fun. Highly recommended, would definitely stay again, no questions about it.",5,2022,04,09
120,3 night break,"Fabulous hotel. Staff were exceptionally helpful and friendly, interconnecting room was perfect for a family and rooms were really quiet. Breakfast had much more choice than many hotels and stayed serving until 11am. Son commented on how good the gym was and enjoyed both that and the pool.
Location was great for exploring; we hardly used the tube because we could walk to so many places. 
Would thoroughly recommend.",5,2022,04,09
120,Another great experience at the Hilton Bankside,"I have been a loyal customer to the Bankside for about 7 years and although we have had some bumps along the way it still remains my London hotel of choice for good reason. From the staff who have been there as long as I have been staying there I always receive a warm welcome and a nice letter from James Clarke the GM and from the concierge who always remembers the funny story about the cheese!!! But also the new ones who have inherited the hospitality from those with a longer history at the hotel. 
This time it was Alessandra on the front desk who epitomized the warmth and grace I have become accustomed to at the Bankside. Nothing was too much trouble for her. 
Well done Hilton Bankside.",5,2022,04,07
120,Perfect service,"Joseph at London Hilton Bankside was the perfect gentleman and host- helping me get my bags, find a taxi, load in, all with a smile. Made my day! 
Hotel is new and well located. Will gladly return
Thank you!",5,2022,04,07
120,Excellent experience,"Do you miss the days stress free travel? Then you must visit this beautiful hotel. The moment I walked in, I was greeted by a meticulously dressed and exceedingly polite doorman, Daniel. He took care of everything- he provides a wonderful first impression of the hotel! Any stress from my day of travel immediately melted away. The reception staff was friendly (especially Alessandra) and when I called for room service later, they were very polite and accommodating.
This is a beautifully appointed hotel that is spotless. I have stayed in many Hilton properties in and around London and this is by far my favorite.
This is a very well managed hotel.",5,2022,04,04
120,Anna & Sophie in Exec lounge,Was staying in a club room so had access to the lounge and the service provided by Anna & Sophie was simply outstanding. A real credit to a fantastic hotel. Thank you ladies. You are making my stay very memorable and I’m already looking forward to coming back!,5,2022,04,03
120,Top shelf service from the moment of arrival - 5 stars all around,"Outstanding service - front desk, housekeeping, in room dining - all top shelf. I traveled to London from San Francisco on business and this hotel has exceeded expectations in every way. The staff went above and beyond to accommodate my needs with such politeness and kindness. I arrived earlier than planned, and they hastened to prepare my room ahead of schedule. The first couple of days I was terribly jet lagged, and the in room dining team was so thoughtful and did everything possible to help me cope. The food is superb, the service is unobtrusive and lovely. 

And the linens… they are fantastic. Everything in the room was thoughtfully put together with the traveler in mind. Enough USB chargers to remove the need for power converters!

I highly recommend this hotel. My new home base in London.",5,2022,04,03
120,Lovely Hotel,Excellent Hilton. Top notch service from the reception team. Beautiful rooms and a great location for exploring the area. Many bars and restaurants nearby. Room service food was average to be honest although Megan who delivered the food was lovely and a real asset to the hotel. Would definitely stay here again. Oh and nearly forgot the pool area which is great.  Very calming and serene. ,5,2022,03,27
120,Mother’s day celebration,"We checked in at Hilton Bankside to celebrate Mother’s day with my family.

120,Weekend Get Away.,"Great hotel in a superb location.

Staff are attentive and Maria in the Executive Lounge / Oxbo restaurant was a star.

We been using Bankside very regularly since 2015 and whilst there maybe more prestigious hotels available, to us, Bankside represents great value and is our hotel of choice when in London.",5,2022,03,22
120,Weekend In The City,"Fabulous hotel.  Immaculate.  Staff so helpful and polite.  We were made to feel so welcome by Daniel The Doorman.  As soon as we walked through the door he offered water  and sweets whilst we waited to check in, nice touch.  Our  Room was ready early so a massive bonus.  Unpacked our luggage and set off to explore. Only a 5 minute walk to the riverside.  Tate Modern on the doorstep.  Walked to Tower Bridge across and back over Millennium Bridge.  Stopped along the way for refreshments and back to the Hotel for an event we were attending.   Bedroom was spacious and had everything we needed including robes and slippers.  Amazing shower.  So quiet no noise from corridors we slept great.   Breakfast next morning was amazing. Plenty of choice, buffet style with an open kitchen ready to cook any specific order needed.  Great choice of fruit, cereals and pastries too.  On checkout we left our luggage, walked over Millennium Bridge to St Paul’s and spent a lovely couple of hours wandering around there.  
Definitely recommend this hotel to anyone. 
Again thank you Daniel, 1st Impressions count and you made a great one and to all staff who made our weekend special.",5,2022,03,21

My Hilton Honors Diamond status is always recognised by way of some wonderful upgrades, but what made this Bankside different were the staff. Contact was made before my stay welcoming us back from Sabrina on the Front Desk. Come the evening we enjoyed the Executive Lounge offerings and when there was an issue with the prosecco, Nevada went above and beyond to rectify this issue, and continued to check we were enjoying our time in the lounge. He is a credit to the Bankside staff and we look forward to meeting him again soon!

120,Fun family stay at the Hilton London Bankside,"Our family of 4 stayed at the London Hilton Bankside for a few nights over the half term break after finding lots of good reviews for it as a family hotel.  We booked family interconnecting rooms so we could have some more space.

Hotel was easy to find and in a great location - we walked about 15 minutes from London Bridge but Southwark tube station is even closer.  The hotel is literally a few minutes walk away from the Tate Modern and the Southbank with lots of restaurants nearby.  

First impressions at the hotel were good - very stylish reception.  We tried to check in early but were asked to come back later so dropped our bags and went shopping - a situation my teenage daughter was delighted with!  We got our keys later and had a bit of a problem as the interconnecting rooms did not have separate beds for our kids so we had to go and change the room - unfortunately this took some time but eventually we got the right room set up which actually turned out to be 2 separate rooms in a private area which worked well for us.

We really liked the hotel facilities - the pool was great for families and we went there every day of our stay - changing and shower facilities were very easy and convenient.  We also realised that we had also access to the executive area with our booking which gave us access to a private lounge with snacks and drinks and a cocktail hour each night with a hot buffet, as well as complimentary breakfast.  This was a great bonus, but it was a bit strange we weren't told about it at check in as it meant we missed out on one nights benefits....

Special mention to some of the staff - like the concierge gents - really friendly and helpful particularly the gentleman who showed us the local beehives.  The lady at breakfast was also really helpful and we had a lovely breakfast on both mornings which was a real treat.

Overall would definitely come back - and with a smoother check in experience and someone explaining all the benefits up front definitely a good chance for 5 stars - would definitely recommend.",4,2022,02,27
120,Great stay!,"We had a wonderful time at Bankside this weekend. Great atmosphere in the executive lounge. Nevada went out if his way to accommodate our needs. Excellent service.

We’ll be back next year. Thank you.",5,2022,02,27

120,Simply Amazing,"This is quite simply the best hotel I have ever stayed at in London.

The rooms are amazing, very high end, the best gin selection ever in the bar - breakfast with too much to choose from and the tranquility of the Executive lounge.

120,An extra special hotel,"A fantastic hotel. The decor is on point, the staff were super helpful and the buffet breakfast was truly special. Loved the touch of being able to also have  omelettes, waffles and pancakes made to order.

When we visited (August 2021), we had to pre book the use of the swimming pool.

We stayed in the one bedroom suite in order that our two girls (4 and 8) had a separate room to us.

We relied on taxis a lot since the nearest tube is a good 10 min walk away especially with a 4 year old. Don’t let that put you off since the hotel was amazing.",5,2022,02,22
120,The perfect hotel when visiting London with great facilities and exceptional staff.,"I have never been welcomed to a hotel so nicely in my whole life! We were greeted by the very helpful concierge and taken to reception. The lovely lady could not have been any more friendly and informative. A glass of Prosecco was a lovely, lovely touch!
After breakfast we were walking towards the lift to go back to our room and the concierge went over and pushed the button to summon the lift. He apologised when we had to wait about a minute!
When we got back from the theatre- which was AMAZING - they had laid out a wee mat and slippers for each of us beside the bed, laid out a glass and water and put soothing music on the TV!! What a place!!
Everything was spotlessly clean and there was a good attention to detail. Clean, comfortable and practically laid out.
The room is a perfect size and has everything you need. The chair with a footstool was just what was needed after a whole day sightseeing! The lighting in the room was really modern and attractive as well as very functional.
The bathroom was well appointed, well lit and really quite lovely. It had a great shower and the taps were cool. 
What a fabulous hotel in a perfect location with top quality rooms, facilities and exceptional staff.",5,2022,02,22

The variety was incredible, everything from fresh fruit to made to order eggs.  But more so, the staff were friendly, attentive, most helpful and immaculately dressed.

Huge room with soft mini bar, coffee machine and nice little extras. Very comfort superking bed. Was my birthday and they left a card and some delicious homemade chocolates. There was a turn down service, which again you don’t see very often these days. We to the executive lounge and it was by far the best exec lounge we’ve been to in all our hilton hotel visits. Delicious fajitas, plus lots of nibbles and extras. Again the drinks service here was very good. We went to the swimming pool in the basement and we had it all to ourselves. They have the jacuzzi which is part of the pool (more hygienic than stand alone jacuzzis) and it was lovely and relaxing down there. Loved the loungers down there too. In the evening they had a free sweet cart at reception, which again was a nice touch. Breakfast the next day again was outstanding. I’ve never seen such a huge selection of nuts, seeds, dairy, etc, etc. they even cook fresh pancakes and waffles to order. Overall an exceptional experience and you can see why it’s so popular.

120,Celebration stay,My husband and I stayed here November 2021 for my birthday/Xmas shopping. Hubby loved the pool. Stayed in the King with lounge access which we thoroughly enjoyed - room decor ensures you unwind from a long day of shopping! (Plus the drinks/food also help!). Facilities in room and breakfast are the high standards that Hilton say and do deliver. Loved our stay so much we have booked for May with our sons/partners to celebrate our 25th wedding anniversary as we will be renewing our vows in our favourite city - can’t wait to go back 😀,5,2022,01,29
120,Family break,"We’ve stayed here once before and booked again
Family of 4: chosen for amenities (Tesco/sainsburys outside); swimming pool; location; level of service and quality.

Our trip went well. Service with a smile; great pool; executive lounge served us well; breakfast a delight….freshly made waffles, pancakes and omelettes.

I would like to thank everyone individually, but can’t recall names - those on reception; room service; executive lounge; chef (2 cooking the food fresh especially) and all staff in OXBO. I can’t recall everyone’s names so am doing a disservice not to including their names.

Hilton Bankside management: your staff are great. Please ensure this is fed back to all the staff.",5,2022,01,24
120,Great Hilton,"Just completed another stay at Hilton Bankside. 
As always we had a great time.
Staff are so kind, helpful and accommodating
We was offered a glass of Prosecco upon check in
Rooms are cosy and modern
Breakfast is high quality with lots of choice
Executive lounge is a nice place to relax ( please bring back afternoon tea ) 
Just across the road from Tate Modern and a few minutes walk to Borough market
This is my go to Hilton when i am in London because of the high levels of service and being so consistent.
Highly recommended",5,2022,01,24
120,Best Hilton,"I've stayed at a fair few Hiltons around the UK/USA and this is the best one so far. All of the staff (concierge, chefs, reception, housekeeping, servers, and others) are extremely friendly and go out of their way to make your experience as good as it can be. Breakfast buffet is delicious and has tons of food to choose from. Location is good and close to everywhere you need to be. Only 'negative' is that there is not much of a view from the rooms if that's what you want. Special mention to Sabrina who works at the reception desk who I thought did an excellent job considering another colleague mentioned she was new to the role and currently going through training - something you would not be able to tell if it was not mentioned. Sabrina was extremely friendly and polite, made the check-in and check-out process seamless, and provided a great service overall. Other seasoned Hilton Hotel employees I have met before could learn a thing or two from her about customer service. 5/5!",5,2022,01,23
120,A City Break,"Very friendly service.  After a long day at the museums, a very efficient and personable check in.  The room was very good, clean and spacious for London, with complementary fruit and mini bar.  The breakfast buffet was extensive and the food was good.  Definitely would return if in London overnight again.",5,2022,01,21
120,Another great stay,"Another great stay. Friendly reception, comfy beds, great shower and tasty breakfast. I was travelling to Gatwick early in the morning and Blackfriars station is only a 10 min walk away to jump on the direct train. Airport 30 mins away. Perfect, I’ll be back! 👍",5,2022,01,21
120,One of Hiltons Finest 🇬🇧,"We have stayed at the Hilton London Bankside multiple times and the high quality of service from NATASHA BELUSSI and attention to detail remains above and beyond. The chef Ali makes a lovely breakfast and the rooms are comfortable and clean. The only thing that needs improvement, in my opinion, is the quality of the food in the lounge which is repetitive and bland. Next time we are in the area, we will absolutely stay at The Hilton Hotel and I recommend it to anyone visiting London. 🌸",5,2022,01,18
120,Exceptional hotel,A fantastic hotel in a great location! Quality of the hotel was of high standards and Brent at reception provided excellent service. Breakfast was of high quality and adhering to all the covid restrictions. ,5,2022,01,17
120,The Best Hotel and Service in London,"Hilton London Bankside Hotel exceeded our expections. We are a big family and we were amazed at the professionalism and yet compassionate care. The staff and managers were extremely kind, respectful, and helpful. Room service was excellent, concierge service went above and beyond, and the breakfast delicious. The pool and executive lounge were the icing on the cake for us. Every part of our stay was wonderful. We will definitely return to this hotel again. By the way, location is excellent for walks by the river and close to London Eye. Thank you Leandro and Natasha for your excellent service in making our stay memorable and unforgettable. May God bless you all!",5,2022,01,15
120,A must stay place in Southwark. Great staff and great hotel 10/10 . Thank you Bankside,What a hotel and what an amazing staff team. Supefriendly and professional throughout. Cannot fault this place and the team. Breakfast buffet is epic and the bar has great atmosphere and great decor. The kids are made to feel welcome and the table tennis was a nice touch. Great location to the Tate and the river. We will be back,5,2022,01,14
120,Luxurious central London hotel,"We stayed here as part of a London stay for my birthday and it was lovely! We normally keep costs down and use the purple chain, and we now are converted. Lovely big hotel, we had our room upgraded and loved it. The beds were massive, and the wet room/shower were great. Staff were super helpful (thank you Brent!) and the breakfast was an amazing range. Location was really central. Highly recommend!",5,2022,01,13
120,Miss Dimitrova,"I am so grateful and impressed with the service. 
Felt very welcomed. 
The team were nothing short of wonderful, incredibly helpful and diligent. 
The room was sparkling 👏. 
Team member recognition- Sabrina at the front desk, extremely polite. 
Thanks Everyone. You are a credit to the Hilton brand.",5,2022,01,11
120,Rescued from a terrible AirBnB,"I booked interconnecting rooms the day of the stay because the Airbnb we had booked for a couple nights was not good and we weren’t comfortable staying there. The rooms were fabulous, the towels in the bathrooms were huge, the decor is so incredible I’d like to style my own home the same way, and the children’s touches that they provided (tiny robe and slippers, fox blanket and pillow, book, and a take home toy) were so special and made my daughter very happy. Thank you Hilton for rescuing us and giving us a good night’s sleep!  ",5,2022,01,11
120,Great service from Cas,"Outstanding service, breakfast fantastic, great pool.

We had exceptional service in the exec lounge from a lovely lady called Cas. 

We really enjoyed our stay and look forward to coming back.

The room was a little small but we will try a suite on our return. The hotel is modern and the atmosphere is great. Staff all really friendly on reception and the rooms are immaculate",5,2022,01,09
120,Great central London hotel for family trip,"We are just back from spending three nights at this hotel.

It was a great location for a family break.

Main plus points :

5 min walk from Southwark tune station or 30 minute walk into central London 

The family room was effectively two interconnecting rooms which was brilliant so the kids ( 13 and 9) felt like they had their own space.

The breakfast was a hot and cold Buffet arrangement. They will do any kind of eggs you want or pancakes. The choice and variety was great.

The basement pool and gym was nice. This allowed a bit of chill out time for the kids which you won’t normally get in a city centre hotel

The staff were all really helpful

All in all I would definately recommend the hotel and I would stay here again.",5,2022,01,09
120,A jewel in Hilton’s crown,"This 5 star Hotel is located at the north end of Great Suffolk Street close to the Tate modern, and has good transport connections for London’s attractions.

The nearby underground stations are Southwark and Borough which are about 8 and 10 minutes walk away respectively.

The hotel has everything you would expect from a 5 star property; it has full facilities gym, swimming pool, restaurants etc. 

The rooms are well appointed and fully equipped and special touches like the luxury toiletries, bath robes, slippers etc. makes you feel very much at home and valued a guest. 

Breakfast is full buffet which is excellent and of the highest calibre with a chef on duty to prepare eggs etc. Lunch, Dinner, and afternoon tea are also available. A bottomless brunch is offered at the W/E which is exceptionally good value.
The executive lounge is open throughout the day for coffee, tea, soft drinks, and for the evening social with canapés and alcoholic drinks.

The staff at this hotel certainly go the extra mile, it seems nothing is too much trouble for them; they do everything to make guests welcome, and comfortable, whilst keeping them safe.

My stay on this occasion was for business and reception were incredibly helpful; and made sure everything ran smoothly for me.

I can highly recommend this hotel for both business and leisure.",5,2022,01,07
120,Wonderful stay with kids,"We treated ourselves to the interconnecting rooms with our 11 and 9 year old girls. The whole experience was wonderful, lovely rooms with a soft toy for the girls and friendly, attentive staff. Being able to message the front desk from the Hilton app was helpful and response was always very quick. The swimming pool was gorgeous and a big hit with the girls. Would also highly recommend the breakfast. We will be returning!",5,2022,01,06
120,Excellent - single family visit,"All the London Bankside teams really do try to ensure your maximum happiness, with their absolutely terrific customer service.

We upgraded our room on this last visit, but to be honest, there was no real difference, apart from a slightly better window outlook.

Absolutely fantastic breakfast, with a tremendous selection of food. If I were being incredibly picky, then I'd say the bacon quality could have been better as it was too fatty.

The swimming pool is nice; however, it's not the biggest, and the jacuzzi aspect is the same temperature as the main pool - which is on the minimum. 

The rooms are always incredibly clean, and the beds are very comfortable. The housekeeping team does a terrific job. 

I personally had a bad experience with the minibar as when I went to take the cap off the coke bottle, the cap exploded off and really hurt my thumb. They are looking into this!

Overall we really enjoyed our stay and will return in the future. Oh I nearly forgot, the location is excellent as it's only 1 underground stop from Waterloo and is close to many areas of interest. 

P.S. It also has a Tesco Extra and a Sainsbury's Local very close, which is very useful for drinks and snacks for your trips out and late walks.

Thank you.",5,2022,01,05
120,One night stay - executive king with club access lounge,"I really enjoyed my stay at this hotel. I was by myself and I loved that it feels super safe.

Room was super big and clean. I enjoyed the lounge a lot, I was working on my ipad and it was a quiet and relaxing place, with drinks and nibbles too.

The staff member that was at the reception, Alessandra, was exceptionally nice and professional, she has also told me the story behind the ""fox"" theme. I have stayed in many hotels and it's not easy to find such amazing staff members!

The only downside was that the pool was a bit chaotic, maybe they could put some quiet hours?

Overall best hotel I stayed in London so far.

Will be back!
Flavia.",5,2022,01,02
120,Superb stay,Fabulous hotel. Stayed 4 nights in family interconnecting room which was perfect for our 2 teens. Loads of space. Luxurious and comfortable. Reception area beautifully decorated for festive season. Staff so friendly and the gentleman on concierge was very helpful and went out of his way to help us with transport options. Breakfast amazing and the distillery bar a lovely addition for an evening drink. Will definitely come back and the location near Southbank was ideal for us as a family.,5,2021,12,31
120,Amazing stay.,"Hilton Bankside is a modern hotel within easy reach of the treasures of London.  Staff, breakfast, pool all excellent.  Things to note, executive lounge is the best we’ve stayed in with good food and decent drinks.  Breakfast can be cooked to order and the seating area is lovely.  Staff were really friendly…we’ll be back!  - The Baxter’s.",5,2021,12,31
120,Amazing stay,"We had a brilliant, one night stay in the Hilton Bankside. I have always wanted to stay in this hotel after attending an event there a few years ago - and they didn't disappoint. The room was spotless and stylish, the bed and sheets incredibly comfortable, and we luckily had access to the Executive Lounge which was well worth the extra money! The food and drink available in the evening was amazing. And a big thank you to Kacia, who was serving us in the lounge - she was so personable and made us feel so welcome!!! 
Plus the breakfast was to die for. Just wanted to mention that too!",5,2021,12,30
120,Excellent modern hotel in perfect location,"Excellent stay. Very contemporary hotel, everything looked new and clean.

 Great service from all staff.

Room was spacious and modern with a great, large shower.

The bar offered a good selection of cocktails and lunch was very good. 

Pool and gym were clean and very quiet so brilliant for the children.

Excellent location and staff really friendly and helpful.

Usually we stay at high end hotels around Mayfair and this is the first time at a Hilton hotel and we were really impressed. 

Would thoroughly recommend and look forward to staying in the future.",5,2021,12,30
120,Excellent place for a family.,"Room layout was perfect for a family. My kids liked the sofa bed, which was made and pulled out on entry. The bathrooms were great. The breakfast was very nice for an included breakfast. Proximity to the Thames river was a major selling point with just a short walk to the ferry to allow for convenient access to many of the great attractions of London.",5,2021,12,29
120,Another Amazing Stay,"Just returned from another amazing stay at Hilton Bankside. We use this hotel half a dozen times a year since it opened in 2015 and we honestly would never stay anywhere else. The standard and cleanliness has remained excellent. The staff always go the extra mile to make you feel welcome, can’t rate them highly enough. We were dubious about going due to the negative media coverage about London but so glad we did. The pool gym and spa are all open as normal as are the bar and restaurant which was a bonus. Concierge arranged the valet parking and the car was brought back to the hotel within 5 minutes, at £40 per night I thought it was excellent value. Overall an excellent stay and still a great atmosphere, if you are thinking of going in the next week I’d say go 100% 

We will be back in February 🤞",5,2021,12,29
120,"Lovely property, but Diamond member accommodation lacked during Covid","Property was nice and clean…but due to local Covid restrictions we had to depart early.  This was our of our control and the property did not offer an understanding, they charged a penalty to our account.  We were charged for internet when we were told it was complimentary.  ",3,2021,12,23
120,Family friendly,The Hilton Staff really welcomed our family with four young children. The pool was lovely for the kids. The breakfast was perfect. Adjoining rooms were very convenient. We greatly enjoyed our stay. We admired the lovely Christmas scene in the lobby beautifully created by the hotel bakery staff. We would thoroughly recommend this hotel for a family visit.,5,2021,12,22
120,Wonderful stay,"Just returned from a wonderful stay at this hotel. The team were brilliant, we were very well looked after, impeccable cleanliness, great service, great food, and a lovely atmosphere in the hotel despite London being unusually quiet for obvious reasons!

Looking forward to returning next year 

Thank you to all the team, and Merry Christmas",5,2021,12,22
120,One of the loveliest hotels I've stayed in!,"From the lovely warm welcome from Alessandra on the front desk to the superb service by all the staff in the restaurant, first class all round.  
Nothing was too much trouble and myself and my daughter had a wonderful stay.
The room was top class with a large screen tv, rainfall shower, robes and slippers and the bed was luxuriously comfortable.
It was the little touches though that made this hotel stand out, for example an umbrella in the wardrobe for the unpredictable British weather and the night lighting in the bathroom.  We will definitely be back and I'd highly recommend.",5,2021,12,17
120,Another excellent stay,"Our first return since the beginning of the pandemic and I’m pleased to say it’s still as good as it was.  We were warmly welcomed by Head concierge John who took our bags to be taken up to the rooms immediately. It was great to see some familiar faces who came over to welcome us back. 
The reception staff swiftly checked us in to our twin executive and king deluxe rooms, which were clean and comfortable.  I enjoyed the free minibar, especially the local lemonade. 
Glad to see the Executive Lounge is open again, unlike some hotels who like to hide behind staffing issues. I’m sure there are problems here too, but management does a great job in making sure the guests don’t receive a lesser service.  Drinks are served by staff, who amazingly remember what your favourite drink is after one night! 
Breakfast served in Oxbo is still excellent, I would come to this hotel just for it. 
When we wanted to check out reception was very busy, and again concierge John came to our rescue, because my card was on file he said he’d send me an invoice via email, which I received even before my taxi arrived!  
My only complaint, and I mentioned this to reception, was that some towels have a horrible smell when getting wet. It’s a problem I’ve experienced in other hotels which use the same linnen company.  Otherwise it would have been a 5* review.",4,2021,12,15
120,Best hotel in bankside,"Everything were fantastic! They best hotel staffs ever.  Spotless room, wonderful room service, great location, tasty breakfast with lot of options, helpful and friendly staffs, beautiful decors, everything were perfect.  They made cold days in London felt warmer, can’t wait to return",5,2021,12,09
120,Anniversary trip,"We continue to use the hotel, well situated, the staff are helpful and friendly, specifically John Kortenray, head concierge and Verdiana in the restaurant, for her thoughtfulness to make our anniversary stay special. The fruit in the room was a nice touch also.",5,2021,12,07
120,Great stay,"Don’t normally write reviews but we had such a positive experience. 
Stayed in an interconnecting family room for 2 nights, which were 2 nice and spacious rooms and bathrooms.  Fox toys and blankets went down very well with our 3 and 6 year old. 
Breakfast was a good quality buffet, and children ate free.
The staff were so helpful, from reception, to servers in restaurant, to the concierge- who actually ran down the street to get us a cab.
And it’s in a great location, right next to tate modern. 
Will definitely stay again. Highly recommended. ",5,2021,12,06
120,Another great stay,"Another fantastic stay. 
Love this hotel cannot fault it. 
Interconnecting  rooms are fab with family with teenagers. 
We had dinner at the hotel which was great & also breakfast. 
can’t wait to stay again. 

All staff are fantastic & can’t do enough to make your stay great.",5,2021,12,06
120,Best hotel I have ever stayed at in London,"I recently visited with my mum.
We arrived early due to a change in train timetable.
The hotel were very friendly on arrival.We were able to leave our luggage and carry on with our day.
When we came back to check in we were greeted  with friendly staff again.We were handed a glass of Prosecco and explained breakfast and opening times of executive lounge.Which was fabulous and also staff were superb.
Our room was gorgeous only criticism is a little too dark for us.We were treated like princesses on our trip and every single member of staff went over and beyond.We were totally impressed and had a fantastic stay.The breakfast was amazing ! And again staff so helpful.
We have already booked our next trip and this time bringing my sister to enjoy the luxury and this time the pool too.It’s hard to pin point one member of staff as they were all so excellent but special shout out to Sophia in the executive lounge and the guys on concierge.
Well done Hilton fab hotel we’ll be back x",5,2021,12,04
120,Best Hotel experience in London,"Having spent over 10 days in Hilton Southbank, I have nothing but high regards for the hotel and staff...the accommodation, staff and location is idea if you want a vacation in a city.. minutes from the river embankment and central London, I will be returning to this location every time I came back to London...the staff made you so at home.",5,2021,11,30
120,This Hotel is ok,"The trouble when you franchise a global brand is the franchisee rarely has the same values as the brand owner. This is an ok hotel, with ok rooms, ok service and good enough amenities.  Unlike most Hilton Hotels
- the bar closes at 11.00pm
- the only food is basic bar food
- room service ends at 11.00pm
- instant coffee only in rooms
- very basic English spoken by most of staff",3,2021,11,29
120,great overnight stay,"Needed a hotel on the south bank. The staff were extremely helpful, the room was a good size and the hotel pool was fab. The hotel is tucked behind the Tate, so very easy walking to Southbank, Borough Market and across to St Pauls.",5,2021,11,27
120,Excellent modern hotel!,"Great hotel and location.
Prior to check in I had an email from THAIS who wanted to make sure everything was in order. Upon arrival I was upgraded due to diamond membership. Lovely modern room. Excellent pool and gym. 

6 to 8pm was drinks and canapés in the exec lounge and the staff in there were very attentive. 

Will be sure to come back here with my family when not on business.

Well done hilton bankside. A credit to hilton brand ",5,2021,11,25
120,Fantastic stay on this theatre trip with the kids,"The hotel was perfect for our quick trip to London to see a show. The reception was fantastic with a glass of bubbly/sweets for the kids on arrival, and relaxed approach to check in (not stood at the desk for ages which seems standard at most other hotels!). 

The interconnecting rooms were brilliant for our family (2 adults and 2 kids), plenty of space, 2 bathrooms etc. The hotel was fantastically clean, in the rooms and the other areas and the rooms were spaces, airy and quiet. 

Location for us was brilliant, close enough to everything in central London but still felt quiet. Close to the borough market and the shard. 

Would 100% recommend this place, the staff, the location and the hotel itself with first class.",5,2021,11,22
120,Fabulous hotel,Such friendly and helpful staff who could not do enough for us. I could not recommend this more highly and would love to visit again. Great comfortable rooms and just the right balance of family friendly but also a vibrant city feel.,5,2021,11,21
120,Great family friendly hotel,"Beautiful hotel, great staff who were so polite and welcoming. We loved this hotel, we’ll definitely be back.

When we got to our rooms (interconnecting) the children had their own dressing gowns, slippers and kids blankets. They also had a teddy each which was a gift from the hotel.
Swimming pool was great.
Entire hotel was spotless and comfortable.",5,2021,11,20
120,Fantastic Service.,"HH Diamond, I have stayed in a lot of their London locations and Bankside is right up there. Gatwick to Blackfriars by train, then a short walk to the hotel.
Lobby area is very impressive, the service in the hotel is 1st class from check-in to departure.
We had a nice upgraded room, great breakfast choices, and lovely evening in the executive room. Special mention to the staff there Maria and Sophie. I didn't get his name but we arrived back late from a show and the gentleman at reception who went himself to the kitchen and ordered our room service.
Hotel is steps from Tate Modern, a nice walk over the Millennium Bridge to St Paul's. We walked along the embankment to Westminster.",5,2021,11,14
120,Great venue and hotel,I stayed here for a conference over 2 days. Great location and the accommodation was fantastic. Food during my stay was extremely good. From light bites all the way through to full meals. Staff all through the hotel were very professional and very attentive at the right time. ,5,2021,11,11
120,Long weekend in London,"First visit to Hilton Bankside.  Great location and easy access from Southwark U/G station.  Staff very welcoming and helpful. Spacious family rooms and Executive room.
Comfy beds and excellent shower. Executive Lounge much bigger than anticipated with good range of food and drink.  Breakfast in main restaurant - great choice and good quality.",5,2021,11,06
120,Great hotel for Business and Family Stays,"I have stayed here a few times on Business, and I knew the facilities would be good to bring my family down when In London.
Im very selective of where I bring the children, my 10 year old has Autism, so I know the environment he needs and what works for him.
They provided a early check in. - had sweetie bags for the boys which was a very cute gesture.
The boys loved using the pool, which was huge, modern and actually quite serene. Great gym facilities which overlook the pool.
The restaurant provided great meals, and also had a nice ambience for family.
Our last night of stay, my son had a meltdown in the restaurant, I had to remove him from the table so he wouldnt disturb others dining, and take him back to the room. He was very upset, loud and screamed the whole way.
The staff were patient with us, helped me with lifts and doors and provided a safe journey back to our room.
The location is great , we had interconnecting King rooms so all 4 of us could come and go between rooms.
Thanks so much, ill be staying again soon in December :)",5,2021,11,05
120,FANTASTIC STAY: THANK YOU TO THE TEAM,"Just spent a thoroughly enjoyable night at the Hilton Bankside and what a great hotel it is. Many thanks to Raoul and James the management team for organising the stay so well and their operational team for such a great experience: Bar, room service, breakfast all excellent.

Thank you",5,2021,11,05
120,"A great Hilton, especially for a family stay","By far the best hotel we have used in London for a family break, partly as they have interconnecting family rooms but also because of the friendly and superb service offered by all staff we encountered.

In a great location just behind Tate Modern and the Thames, whilst some Covid measures are still in place the hotel is relaxed and offers all services expected.

Our children especially enjoyed the swimming pool, kid sized robes and slippers and the full buffet breakfast.

Highly recommended and we would definitely use again.",5,2021,11,01
120,Brilliant 1-night stay,"My two girl friends and I stayed last weekend (30th Oct) for a 1 night trip away and were really impressed by the facilities at Bankside Hilton. We had a warm welcome upon arrival, greeted with prosecco and smiles. Our room was spacious and had two double beds and a lovely big bathroom. Breakfast in the morning was great and we used the spa until 1pm where we were kindly granted a late checkout so that we could enjoy the facilities a little longer. The staff are all so friendly and professional and we would definitely return based on that fact alone - nothing was too much to ask for them. Thank you all!",5,2021,11,01
120,London family trip,"Great location.Family rooms do not apparently guarantee twin beds for kids! Our 14 hear old  son and 8 year old daughter had to share a double. We did not have adjoining doors but a small corridor between rooms with a lockable fire door, which meant several keys to get between rooms. Reception said this was acceptable as a family room.
Breakfast was good quality but you have to make your own hot drinks, then queue to get separate milk. You also have to queue to get eggs meaning other food goes cold whilst waiting. Plenty if staff stood around not doing much. They would be better providing table service for some aspects like coffee and tea.",3,2021,10,29
120,Fantastic stay,"With a stunning view of the shard and ever friendly and helpful staff on duty, the most amazing atmosphere of calm yet buzzing joy. Not to mention the fantastic breakfast, with anything you could wish for. Staying here feels personal and the attentiveness of everyone there makes it a delight.",5,2021,10,27
120,Getaway,A lovely clean comfortable welcoming hotel. Really warm and helpful staff members. Very comfy bed. Excellent variety at breakfast. Good location to london attractions and restaurants! A good hotel to recharge your batteries!,5,2021,10,25
120,Brilliant Already,"We have just stayed the first of 3 nights in the Hilton Bankside. The staff are fantastic, nothing is too much trouble. 

First impressions as we walked through the door were it was lovely and spacious, the kids appreciated their pick of the sweet trolley to take up to our rooms. 

We have two spacious rooms 602 & 604 which interconnect, they are perfect for families and I consider them well priced for London. They are well presented, all very modern and look newly done, far exceeded my expectations. The bathrooms are beautiful, not a chipped tile or bit of filler in sight! So many London hotels are tired but Hilton have come up trumps with this one. Also, blackout curtains and aircon work well and the beds are super comfy. 

The breakfast was voted, 'the best I've  had in a hotel' by my son, I'm not sure what else you could have asked for, pancakes and eggs were cooked to order and everything delicious and fresh. 

It is a great location, round the corner from Southwark tube and a short walk to Waterloo. Loads of restaurants within easy walking distance for dinner. The area feels very relaxed, but you are only a few stops on the tube to central London. 

Still to try the pool and gym but looks great.

I wouldn't hesitate to book this hotel again. Thanks Hilton Bankside. ",5,2021,10,24
120,Ridiculous Incident,Staff at Hotel were completely ridiculous over the use of a ladder - no common sense prevailed at all.... I have no idea why so many staff had to get involved in what was such a trivial matter - one said yes and some said no - not impressed,1,2021,10,22
120,Great staff and good location,"I used to work in the Bankside area many years ago and was surprised at its transformation from a commercial zone to a desirable residential area.

I found the location excellent with local restaurants, Tate Modern and Borough Market nearby with the rest of the city accessible by Southwark station or by foot.

My reservation was for a King Exec room with lounge access which was selected at online check- in on the Hilton app - something I probably won't do again however.

My flight into London arrived early and I arrived well before the official check- in time, and as expected, my room wasn't ready, however, I was given access to the lounge for a coffee which was appreciated and I dropped off my luggage before exploring the area.

I arrived back at the hotel shortly before check-in time to be told that the room was still not ready which seemed to be the same situation for others sitting in reception who were being offered Prosecco while they were waiting. I don't know what the criteria is for being offered a drink, but it seemed I didn't fulfil it!

Eventually I got the room I selected (apparently the reason for the delay as I had picked a specific room) but another would have been fine, although it was disappointing that no Honors upgrade was offered.

The room was spacious, clean and light and the complimentary (soft drink) mini bar was welcome. If you are expecting views from the room like the Hilton Park Lane, you will be disappointed. That said, the room was quiet as was the surrounding area.

The executive lounge was really good with a reasonable choice of food and drinks and the two staff manning the lounge on the evening I was there were excellent, however, I just wish there was a notice that requested that guests in the lounge refrained from using their devices on loud speaker as I am certainly not interested in the affairs of the couple sitting nearby having a discussion with their friends back home. I was also surprised to see a guest allowed in the lounge the following morning wearing her dressing gown.

Quality of sleep was very good and breakfast was served in the hotel restaurant. It was great to be able to have food buffet style after all of the Covid restrictions and the choice of food at breakfast was excellent with staff to match.

Don't be put off staying here because of location - walking across the nearby Millennium footbridge gives you easy access to the many sights of the city and I would have no hesitation in staying here again.",4,2021,10,15
120,A Great Hotel,"Slight Confusion on checkin as I had two separate bookings, but all sorted. Not much of a welcome as diamond, I had to ask about access to Executive lounge, but to be fair I think the staff member might have been new. nice to have the lounge back open and breakfast, as usual, was excellent. Its very well placed close to Southwark tube and we walked to the West End in around 20 minutes. Still one of my favourite Hilton's.",4,2021,10,14
120,Almost perfect,"We recently stayed at the Hilton London Bankside with our toddler. The hotel is wonderful. We got a very warm welcome, with Prosecco on arrival and sweets offered to the little one. Our rooms were ready early and we’re very spacious and modern. We had interconnecting rooms with a large, comfortable bed in each, bath in one bathroom and shower in another. Facilities are excellent. The pool was lovely. Breakfast was amazing with pretty much everything you could think of on offer.  Staff were very conscientious and even helped us with our over-tired toddler on our last day. We also found the location very good.

Our only gripe would be the use of the pool. Due to covid the changing facilities were closed and we were asked to come to reception in our gowns to get a key. Personally, I found standing in reception in a dressing gown quite degrading, especially when you had to fill in a form too so it’s not just a quick transaction. Also there was no dressing gown provided for my little boy so he was in his swimwear in quite a chilly reception area (towels for the pool are provided at the poolside not in the rooms). This could be improved. 

All in all, an excellent stay and we would love to return.",4,2021,10,04
120,"Modern, Clean, Comfortable, Excellent Service","I chose this hotel because 1) I’m a Hilton loyalist 2) it was pretty close to the Southwark tube station and 3) the reviews were good. I was there for three nights in a king deluxe. The room was clean, comfortable, a good size and well equipped with all the amenities you would need, including some nice extras like robes and slippers. The blackout drapes were very effective. There were ample electric outlets and USB chargers. I especially liked the bathroom because it was a good size and it had a l large walk-in shower with both a rain shower head and a wand. The water pressure was good and there was plenty of hot water. The bed was a bit too firm for me but I slept well. The buffet breakfast was excellent, expansive and the quality was excellent. This included cooked to order eggs. The service from the hotel staff was very courteous and professional. It was also convenient to have a Tesco Express and a Sainsbury Local just a few steps away. The only disappointment was that the restaurant was not open for lunch or dinner on weekdays. Highly recommend this hotel.",5,2021,10,03
120,Perfect stay with exceptional service,"What an exceptionally great hotel. The place is so relaxing so convenient, so organised and efficient. The staff are completely on it, they understand great service. Special mention to the concierge services who helped us with everything as we were getting married in the Globe nearby. I am now a Hilton Brand junky and wouldn’t stay anywhere else in London. Thank you so much for making our stay perfect.",5,2021,10,03
120,Shoddy service. Incompetent management. No Honors benefits,"Two out of four stays here have been absolutely terrible. 
I really want to like this hotel, it looks nice, but the service is terrible and staff are it appears consistently incompetent. 

This time…
- told food was available until 11pm in the restaurant, then told in the restaurant the kitchen was closed. 
- room service doesn’t run later than the restaurant so the opportunity was missed to get any food so went to bed with no dinner
- no upgrade offered for Diamond status despite loads of rooms being available online
- they turned away a walk up customer despite having rooms available
- there was a really really noisy corporate group in shouting and swearing in the lobby bar - staff did nothing
- executive lounge access didn’t work
- no rooms available to extend stay, despite there being loads available online
- you just get the feeling they don’t care",1,2021,10,01
120,Hilton Hotel Bankside,"This Hotel was one of the nicest I have ever stayed in. The rooms was spotless, Staff was just so helpful and friendly and the food and services provided was excellent! The location was also ideal it was around a 5 minute walk from the Southwark underground tube station.

I could not fault this hotel and would definitely stay again.",5,2021,09,30
120,Weekend Break,"Great location, 5 minutes walk from tube station. Hotel was spotlessly clean as were the big bedrooms,very comfy beds. Lovely breakfast with lots of choice and on until 11am. Very friendly welcoming staff, with a glass of Prosseco on arrival and sweets got the children.",5,2021,09,28
120,Return visit- great stay- the staff make this place,"I have stayed at the Hilton Bankside a few times now and their staff are really the best I have encountered at most hotels I have stayed at. There must be a good vibe amongst the staff and the management as it is just reflected in the naturally cheerful and helpful energy that is given off. 

Complimentary prosecco whilst waiting to check in, a lobby that smells divine (what fragrance do they use? They should sell it onsite), friendly staff in the restaurant for their stellar Oxbo brunch at the weekend and doormen who can't do enough for you!

Had to book the pool post covid and they don't have changing room facilities so you get changed in your room and go down in robes- my friend had bought a kaftan with her and that's a great idea whilst it is a little more restricted. The pool seemed ever so slightly over chlorinated which made us cough a little bit- we saw them testing when we were leaving so hopefully it got amended.

The beds are super comfortable but I would agree with other reviewers who commented on the rooms being a bit dark- I think the lighting is style over substance and is the type to be quite piercing in the open style shades. They are also lacking in mirrors for hair styling etc. in the bedrooms- but these are pretty minor quibbles really. Highly recommended. Great location, great staff, great facilities and we had a fab time!",4,2021,09,27
120,Great first time stay - staff are exceptional,"Fantastic gem of a hotel, based on the south of the river - within walking distance of Tate Modern, The Globe, Southbank and Southwark Underground (10 mins walk).  Fantastic quality of public areas including restaurant and bar, matched by the quality of the rooms  - good size, easy temperature control, high spec bathroom.  Would have given it 4 stars, but bump it up to 5 for the staff - they were of an unbelievable high standard - courteous and attentive but unobtrusive - not an easy task at this moment in time with a shortage of staff due to Covid and Brexit",5,2021,09,15
120,Excellent family stay,"Room space, cleanliness and peace and quiet was excellent. Service was very good. A couple of minor issues while we were there but these were resolved on the same day. Rooms were a bit dark and made it hard for getting ready and breakfast with quite pricey, given there are good local options available. But overall would certainly recommend.",5,2021,09,05
120,Lovely family stay,Very welcoming and helpful staff. Immaculately clean. Breakfast superb. Great location only a few minutes walk from the tube. Only slight negative was the chlorine in the pool when the hot tub bubbles were turned on. We stayed in an interconnecting room which was perfect with children. We would absolutely stay again.,5,2021,09,04
120,One of the best hotels I have ever been to in the UK,"Due to the lockdown we needed to come somewhere that had a pool, and connecting rooms. Everything in London is expensive in summer holidays, but knowing how much it would have cost to go abroad with the uncertainty of quarantine etc, this was fantastic value. We travelled as a family of 5 (2 adults, 3 children)

Before I booked, I spoke to one of the mangers Stefania.
She was absolutely brilliant - reassured me about getting connecting rooms, and I was in regular communication with her about booking the pool which was a constant source of worry for us - you dont pay a premium to stay in a place with a pool in London not to use it, and my kids were expecting it from the break. She was kind, reassuring and supported us throughout.

Then we got there. Usually we stay be Edgeware road, so this was a bit more of a trek for us, but I had pre-booked car parking at the National Theatre (was very very well priced through one of the third party booking sites, and allowed multiple entry/exit), and they have a little bay in which you can leave your car til you get up into you room.

A porter kindly took our luggage whilst we went in, and my kids were very excited.  This was made even happier when they got their welcome pack of sweeties !
The entranceway had lots of beautiful flowers, had a beautiful aroma, and lots of seating and interesting things for the kids to look at.  We were able to book our swimming for that day and the next as we checked in.

The rooms: 
We had 215/216 - these had a single door in front of them, and we were able to keep the room doors open.
One room was much bigger, had 2 big beds in it, a sofabed, a TV, a fully stocked (and regularly restocked) minifridge which was very useful for us.
The other room was smaller, having a king bed for the adults, again with a stocked minifridge.  They even happily changed what was in the fridge and gave us loads of water as we needed.
Ice was readily available and they were never slow in getting it up to us, nor did they once ask us to collect it ourselves.
The beds were brilliant - nice and soft, gave us all wonderful nights' sleeps. We were able to put the two beds together so my kids could enjoy it all like one big bed.

Bathrooms: the bigger room had a bath and the kids enjoyed this getting filled also. The smaller room had a HUGE walk-in shower which was brilliant and made getting the kids easily washed so much easier.

The pool: wonderful. a nice size, a small jacuzzi section, deep enough to be comfortable and let my 11yo swim on her own. They had little gowns for the kids and slippers which they loved getting into.   The changing facilities were closed due to COVID, but it was easy enough to get to/from the pool. We swam 6 nights out of the seven we were there. There was a nice-looking gym there too, if I was so inclined and hardly anyone used it, so if you are a gym-goer you would like it too.

Breakfast:  The breakfast area has lots of heads of animals on the walls including a unicorn, a giraffe, zebra, toad, alligator, and bear - they are wonderful and my kids absolutely loved them!

The first day we were there, everything was perfect other then the fact I didnt notice the omlette guy changing pans between the ham one and the vegetarian one that I had ordered. I didnt feel comfortable to say anything that day, but a quick email to Stefania meant this was remedied the remainder of the stay.  The regular omlette guy came on in a few days time (Ali) and he was fantastic.  We had a reserved table every morning - the best table in the whole place, with enough room and away from others when my kids occasionally like to throw a little tantrum.  The food: wow!
-daily we had fresh omlettes, waffles, and pancakes.
-the mountains of smoked salmon were delightful.
-the freshly baked muffins were just so delectable - i gained so much weight due to this!
-there was a little box of lollipops that my kids really really enjoyed also.

Special mention must also be made of the hostesses - Corrina and Lina - they knew who we were, were always polite and happy in the way they greeted us - I am certain they had huge smiles on under their masks because you could tell from their voices. Really really special staff they have here.

Also special mention to the concierge team who helped to organise taxi's for us whenever we needed them, and again served us with a smile.

I cannot wait to be back - its not something that we can do on a regular basis as it is expensive, but having 5 of you always means two rooms, and I cant think of any better then these.",5,2021,09,03
120,Excellent,"Stayed for one night as part of a day out in London. The hotel and staff are excellent. We had messed up the booking (my fault) and they couldn’t have been more helpful in sorting it out. The room was lovely, spacious and faultlessly clean and dinner in the restaurant was good. Breakfast superb - definitely book again.",5,2021,09,03
120,"Excellent Location, Superb Hotel",This hotel is superb and is in an excellent location. We had a family room which was very comfortable and gave us a little extra space. Little touches were left in the room for the kids which was a real nice touch. All the staff were very helpful throughout our stay. Breakfast choice was huge and catered for all family members. I will definitely be staying here again. ,5,2021,09,02
120,Wonderful hotel,"A perfect stay in what is now our favourite Hilton. Everything about the hotel is well done. The rooms are spotlessly clean and roomy. Breakfast arrangements and the huge choice of items available make for a wonderful start to the day.This was our first experience of an executive lounge since becoming diamond members and there, too, everything was perfect. The area is lively without being noisy with many restaurants and pubs within a few minutes walk. All the staff were unfailingly friendly, helpful and welcoming. Thank you to everyone. ",5,2021,09,01
120,Great hotel,This was a great hotel to stay in.  The location was very good being just a short walk to the Tate Modern.  The staff were very helpful and friendly.  The hotel is clean and modern.  The food was really delicious.  Loved having the swimming pool.  I would recommend to others.,5,2021,08,31
120,5 night city break,"given all the challenges with Covid and travelling, we opted for a london city break and are so pleased we did! this is an excellent hotel - brilliant staff, atmosphere, design and service. the GM James and his team make their guests feel right at home and very welcome. The spa facilities are good too and we were able to reserve swim times each day.

Breakfast is superb with a very varied selection and special mention goes to the Chefs on the cook stations and the hosts!  

would highly recommend this hotel - you will not be disappointed and the location is superb for exploring the city (check out the Mercato Metropolitan market at Stoke Newington!).",5,2021,08,31
120,Excellent visit as always,"Hotel in an excellent position for Tate, Globe and St. Paul easy to get around all area’s of London. The rooms large comfortable. The staff are always pleasant and helpful we have stayed many times for this reason. All though i do have to say a extra thank you to Brent Silva for his kindness and help.",5,2021,08,31
120,"It had the possibility of brilliance, which is probably the most disappointing thing!","We didn’t like getting woken up in the night by the fire alarm going off. We didn’t like the cold temperature of the swimming pool and the volume of chemicals in it, so much so that it burnt your eyes. The view of a wall only from the bedroom was disappointing, but it is what it is! We really, really didn't like getting charged £60 for breakfasts we didn't have! And not being funny but also getting charged an additional £100, which comes out immediately, as a deposit but then that not coming back for up to a couple of weeks is just ludicrous. It should come back as fast as it goes out! On the plus side the staff are very friendly, the location is great and the room was comfortable and clean.",3,2021,08,30
120,Superb Family Stay,"Stayed here for 3 nights to celebrate two special family birthdays. Location is excellent for attractions. We walked to the London Eye, House of Parliament, Tower of London, crossed the river over the Millennium Bridge to go up to the Sky Garden in the Walkie Talkie building. The south bank river walk is beautiful, lively and plenty to see and do. The hotel staff couldn’t have been more welcoming and friendly, in reception, the restaurant and bar. A special mention to Stefania on the front desk who went out of her way and the restaurant breakfast crew who helped us celebrate special birthdays. The hotel facilities are excellent, very comfy beds, great showers, lovely pool and fantastic breakfast - you couldn’t ask for more.",5,2021,08,29
120,Our favourite hotel in London,"We always stay in this hotel when visiting London and have never had any complaints. With not being able to go abroad this year, we have chosen to visit London instead and stay at this hotel three times in the last three months. The hotel is in a great location, decor throughout the hotel is modern, beds comfortable and bathrooms are amazing.  As for the staff - attentive and friendly - and always a lovely greeting when arriving and “Concierge John” helpful always. Looking forward to our next trip in September.",5,2021,08,27
120,6 Night Break at the Hilton London Bankside,"The hotel is in a great location from exploring the South Bank and an easy walk to many of the major London Theatres.  We were given an upgraded room on the 4th Floor which was very clean and comfortable.   At Check in they gave us a choice to have our room serviced daily or to a schedule that suited us - we chose every other day which worked very well.  Breakfast was served until 11am which was fantastic as we never felt under pressure which is exactly what you need to relax.
The staff were fabulous! so kind, attentive and friendly.  Being a Diamond member I have complimentary access to the Executive Lounge.  The lounge was is very spacious and the service there was first rate!  Overall everyone at the Hotel did a brilliant job to help make it a very memorable, relaxing and wonderful break.  In particular Sofio Veliz went out of her way to make us feel at home in the Executive Lounge.  It was very pleasing to see that it was not just us she was so attentive to - she worked hard to make sure all the guests in the lounge were well looked after.  Thank you Sofio and all the staff at the Hilton London Bankside, see you again soon!",5,2021,08,26
120,Super family break to London,"We had a very enjoyable stay at the Hilton for 2 nights with our two kids. 

We booked 2 family interconnecting rooms (346 and 348). The rooms are connected by a private passage meaning that we could leave our room doors open at night but the kids room was not directly open to ours (there is another door from the private passage into the main hallway). The rooms are very spacious, very clean and quiet. Super comfy king beds. Large, clean bathrooms (each room has its own) - ours had a large walk-in shower and the kids had a bath with shower overhead. 

The staff were extremely friendly, and went out of their way to make our stay enjoyable. Kids got a packet of sweets on arrival and their own bath robes which made their stay. 

The hotel has a large indoor heated pool which we used on both days - the kids loved it. 

The location was good - a short walk to the south bank and walking distance from Waterloo and main Southbank attractions.

All round this was a great stay and I would definitely stay again.",5,2021,08,26
120,Backside base,A warm welcome and safe comfortable room. The excellent executive review has made a welcome return. The tasty breakfast sets you up for a days sightseeing. The nearby South Bank has many interesting places and many stops for the river boats and trips on the river.,5,2021,08,23
120,Lovely Stay in Great Hotel,"Stayed at the Hilton London Bankside Hotel for one night on a Saturday whilst in London to celebrate our Anniversary.
First impressions of the Hotel were great, looked modern, felt comfortable and inviting too. We were greeted by the warm friendly receptionist who offered us glass of champagne, water or sweets.
Our room was 611 and was great apart from the view out the window which was a brick wall but that didn't bother us. The room was modern, spacious, clean and had all the facilities you needed. The bathroom had a lovely big walk-in shower which was great!.

We visited the on site bar, The Distillery, which was great and where I proposed to my girlfriend (She said yes). I did mention it to the man behind the bar who was friendly and wished me well. We received two glasses of champagne which were not from the hotel but a couple behind us who witnessed it which was lovely.

Overall, it was a great Hotel to stay at and definitely felt and looked like a 5 star hotel! Will definitely have to return for another Anniversary as its where I proposed so will always be in our memories!",5,2021,08,22
120,Best stay ever,"We arrived early and the penthouse was not yet ready (As really early) the staff made sure we was looked after before we even got to the room. Wow wow wow thats all we can say, if you get a chance to stay in the penthouse, it is worth it. 
John was amazing as well as Xaverie and Luminta Mucanu at breakfast. The scrambled egg is amazing, wish we could make it like that !!!
Thanks again to all the staff that made our stay cation so wonderful.
Hope to see you again soon Danny and Des 
",5,2021,08,22
120,Great for families and well located,Just spent a very happy week at the Bankside Hilton with our two young children.  Adjoining rooms very well suited to families and children made to feel welcome via some nice touches on arrival (which I won't spoil!).  Staff were all uniformly friendly and accommodating.  Breakfast buffet options were comprehensive and of a high standard.  A word on location: Southwark/Bankside may not be an immediately obvious choice but it's actually a good base from which to attack most of London's top attractions... And at a reasonable price in comparison to Central London.,5,2021,08,21
120,Nice But........,"It has taken me a bit to write this review. The stay was February 2020. 

I had a meeting in London on a Monday and decided to take the weekend off and travel to London with my wife. We flew in early and our room was all ready for us. Early check-in was very much appreciated. We were also given refreshments whilst we checked in. 

The room was a 1 room upgrade. We were Gold Hilton Honors at the time. If I am being honest it was dark and I really did not like it. I also hated the piece of art work that is attached to the wall (a foxes head). The room just is another typical London hotel room without a view. 

Breakfast was the highlight of the hotel. Great selection of food with eggs to order. The staff and two Greek managers were super. 

The pool was small but nice. It would be nice to have a proper jacuzzi after a long day in London. 

The location is okay. It is a walk to anywhere, but it also has an Underground stop close by. 

Overall it was not spectacular and it was not awful. It was simply medium. I am now Diamond HH's and when we stay in London, I would probably choose a hotel with better rooms. We tried the Tower Doubletree 2 weeks after staying at the Bankside and preferred the upgraded room as it was full of light, had a nice view and we gained access to the Exec Lounge as a Gold member. The DT looked after us far better in terms of upgrades than the Bankside.",4,2021,08,21
120,Fabulous family friendly hotel,"Fabulous hotel in a great location. Staff were so welcoming and friendly throughout our stay. We had a family interconnecting room which was great with two teenagers, giving everyone their own space, each room had a fabulous bathroom/shower with complimentary toiletries. . Facilities in the room were also great, refreshment tray and chilled water in the mini fridge. Buffet breakfast was great, plenty of choice from fruits, cereal, continental, cooked breakfast and pastries, hot drinks machine. We had dinner in the bar on our first evening which was delicious and great service, on other evenings we enjoyed desserts, drinks and coffees in the bar, very friendly service each time. We used the pool several times, this needed pre-booking due to Covid, very clean and plenty of comfortable loungers to relax on. Hotel is in a fabulous location, 5 mins walk to Millenium Bridge and 5 mins walk to Southwark tube station. Nice little pub on the corner, The White Hart, where we enjoyed several drinks and an evening meal one night, really friendly atmosphere and service. Look forward to staying here again next time we visit London.",5,2021,08,19
120,"Modern hotel great location, RUBBISH infotainment system","Great location, modern nicely done Hotel. Staff good. My biggest gripe is the infotainment system it is useless and so out of date. Cant watch/stream netflix or prime etc on the in room tv. Can't share content from your phone. They say its blocked because they use an out sourced provider....rubbish ! is that why they charge £13.50 for one of their in house old and so out of date movies. I didnt think this would matter but when you get in from a flight and just want to chill but there is nothing to watch especially your own favourites on your netflix etc it really shows up the hotel and their policy to customers...poor. Any other Hotel we stayed in you could easily share and stream any content you wanted for free !!!",3,2021,08,19
120,Great hotel and Staff,"The Hilton Bankside is the best hotel I've stayed at in London. We booked the interconnecting family rooms which were brilliant, very spacious, well presented and quiet. The check in experience was superb, complimentary drinks and sweet bags for the kids and a really friendly welcome from the front of house staff. The children's activity bag in the room with the fox soft toy made our daughters day. We used the pool both days, it was easy to book a timeslot and the pool itself was modern and stylish. The hotel is perfectly located for the Tate Modern and Borough Market. Southwark tube is a short walk away which makes seeing the rest of London really convenient.",5,2021,08,17
120,Family room visit ,"Booked a family linked room, this was great as the rooms had their own lobby so we could let our daughter have her own room in perfect safety linked to ours but away and off the main corridor. Rooms were great loads of space and set out and decorated really nicely.
",5,2021,08,17
120,Overnight stay,"From the moment we got to the Bankside Hotel, we were so impressed. We turned up early to leave our luggage,  our room was ready and we were able to access it. 
My 7 year old son was given a slinky and a cuddly toy, which went everywhere with us. 
We were visiting to celebrate my husbands birthday, and a cake and fizz greeted us when we got to our room. 
The room was everything that we needed for our trip. Beds were comfortable and the tablet came in very useful when planning what to do.
The following morning we had breakfast at the hotel which was delicious and we could even find something for our very picky son to eat. 
The staff were so helpful, friendly and polite. I really could not fault the Bankside Hotel. 
We will be back.",5,2021,08,17
120,Loved it,"I picked this hotel at the last minute after cancelling another due to last minute bad reviews, so glad I did. Every staff member was friendly and couldn’t do enough for you. The hotel was in a perfect area close the Tate modern and all the riverside restaurants, breakfast is amazing, beautiful bar and restaurant area. Next time we are in London we will be back",5,2021,08,16
120,Another jewel in Hilton’s crown,"This 5star Hotel is located at the north end of Great Suffolk Street close to the Tate modern.
The closest underground stations are Southwark and Borough about 8 and 10 minutes walk away respectively.

The hotel has everything you would expect from a star property; it has full facilities gym, swimming pool, restaurants etc. 

The rooms are well appointed and fully equipped and the special touches like the luxury toiletries, bath robes, slippers etc. makes you feel very much at home and valued a guest. 

Breakfast is full buffet which is excellent and of the highest calibre with a chef on duty to prepare eggs etc.  Lunch, Dinner, and afternoon tea are also available. The executive lounge is open throughout the day for coffee, tea, soft drinks, and for the evening social with canapés and alcoholic drinks.

The staff at this hotel certainly go the extra mile, it seems nothing is too much trouble for them; they do everything to make guests welcome, and comfortable, whilst keeping them safe.
My stay on this occasion was for business and Natasha at reception was incredibly helpful, made sure everything ran smoothly for me.

I can highly recommend this hotel for both business and leisure.",5,2021,08,16
120,House keeping,"I've been staying at the Hilton Doha  On an extended stay. I was very impressed with the housekeeping staff especially Teddy, She was very professional always asking if there was anything the room needed  And she always left the room in excellent conditions.

120,Hilton at its very best,We recently stayed at the Hilton Bankside for 2 nights & from the moment we arrived to check out it was just a superb experience. All of the staff were truly excellent in all departments. The range & choice of food at breakfast was truly spectacular. Great location just 200mtrs from Tate Modern & a short walk to the truly inspiring and mouthwatering Borough Market. Can't wait to return.,5,2021,08,15
120,Fantastic hotel/location,"Fantastic hotel, staff excellent all around, clean, modern. Suite with lounge access very spacious with great bathroom. Lovely breakfast with great choice. Will definitely return. Parking easy nearby if needed.",5,2021,08,14
120,Little haven in London,"Great location, very quiet, large adjoining rooms perfect for family of 4 especially with teens, excellent pool (so nice to swim again) and breakfast . Helpful friendly staff. Highly recommended.  All felt very safe and clean. Thank you. ",5,2021,08,14
120,Simply the Best Hilton ..,"Been here a few time during lockdown when it was very quite. Came here today with our grandkids and it was like “we are so pleased to welcome you back”. A fabulous welcome. It was good to see the executive Lounge open again, which is the best Exec Lounge in the Hilton Group. The high standards we are use to at the loverly hotel are just perfect. Best hotel in London.",5,2021,08,11
120,Very clean hotel and comfortable rooms,"The hotel is well located less than 5 minutes from the South bank and the Tate modern and about a 7-10 minute walk to Southwark tube. 

The hotel itself is spotless inside, still looks very new. 

Very warm welcome from staff on check in.

Good sized pool in the basement - have to book but we had no trouble getting a good slot and no concerns about capacity when we were using it.

Good nights sleep in the room which had a huge bed, good blackout curtains and a very nice bathroom with large walk in shower.

Nice enough area with a few bars, pubs and cafes around it for breakfast / drinks etc if you do not use the hotel for that.

Would stay here again.",5,2021,08,11
120,Good clean hotel with Friendly staff,The hotel staff were very polite and friendly. The hotel is modern which suits us. Breakfast was very good as good choice & nicely laid out and staff cleaning and replacing items promptly. The hotel is only 5-10 minute walk from Borough Market & the Shard and 5 mins from Southwark tube station. ,5,2021,08,11
120,Excellent London Hotel,"Stayed for one night towards the end of July. Managed to check in early. Check in was very efficient. The lobby is very nice. Rooms were nicely decorated and very spacious, including the very large shower. Lots of amenities including an iron and ironing board. We made use of the bar which was nice (but pricey) and took our drinks to our room. The bed and pillows were extremely comfy. 

We used the pool in the morning which was a perfect way to start a relaxing, Sunday morning. Location is good - not too far from Waterloo Station. We were able to leave our bags until we left London. All in all, an excellent hotel and I'd certainly return.

120,"Excellent Hotel, Great Location","Just spent 5 nights at this hotel and was very impressed. Very clean and modern. The staff were attentive as expected from a 5 star hotel. Breakfast was nice, plenty of selection. The pool was nice, could of done with a separate jacuzzi with warmer water. Loved the executive lounge. The location was perfect right behind the Tate and plenty of restaurants nearby. We used the TFL bikes everyday and the location of the drop off for these was 1min from the hotel. Real hidden gem of a hotel, would recommend.",5,2021,08,08
120,Just perfect,"Just perfect really. Although I didn’t use any of the restaurants or bars, the atmosphere in the hotel was amazing. I used checkin on the app but the staff were still super friendly. The design and size of the rooms was really great and the hotel’s location is ideal. Would love to return.",5,2021,08,08
120,Nice one! 🇬🇧,"This was our first trip to London in over ten years and we couldn’t have picked a better hotel and location for us. 

The online ‘app’ experience from room selection to ease at check-in was superb. The interconnected rooms, robes, breakfast was all 10/10. The location was walking distance from some of the best sights including Tower Bridge, the Shard, City Hall, two minutes from the Tate and short walk to underground and Waterloo. 

So many supermarkets, eateries and pubs in the area. 

We used the gym, pool and bar - honestly, fantastic. 

Wouldn’t hesitate to recommend and return. 

Keep up the awesomeness team H.",5,2021,08,08
120,Super friendly staff make this Hotel a must in a great location within London,We wanted our grandchildren to experience the 5 star feel of a London Hotel but it was the friendliness and efficiency of the staff that made our stay very special. The Hilton Bankside is located within 20 minutes of great London attractions and theatre land. The Hotel swimming pool is divine and Covid secure as far as it can be. Overall we will return!!,5,2021,08,05
120,Hilton London Bankside - Sofia Veliz,"We’ve just had the most wonderful staycation and week away in London at the Hilton Bankside. Huge thanks to all the team at The Hilton Bankside who have looked after us but a particular shout out to the truly divine Sofia Veliz who has been an absolute star. We are so very privileged to have experienced your hospitality, service and professionalism and you are a truly great asset to the Hilton family, and we look forward to seeing you again real soon.

Thank you, thank you, thank you  - John & Nick from Edinburgh🙏",5,2021,08,05
120,Amazing Family holiday,"Hotel was fantastic, great location, all the usual facilities and spotlessly clean. What really made a difference was the staff, they could not have been more helpful, friendly and welcoming.

We would definitely recommend and we will stay there again on our next visit to London. I would like to make specific reference to Frederica (reservations team) who assisted when I had made a mistake in our initial booking. She really made the right impression as our initial contact and that friendliness and professionalism continued throughout our stay.

Very family friendly and cannot recommend highly enough.",5,2021,08,03
120,One of my favourites!,"An absolutely amazing hotel! 

My partner & I visited here and we both loved it! 

From our greeting at check-in to the second we left, everything was easy, enjoyable and stress-free. The staff were friendly, professional and 100% dedicated to doing more than needed. 

We were able to contact them through the Hilton Honours app and had astoundingly fast responses and the best room service. Everything we could have needed was able to be sorted efficiently; extra towels, cotton buds, info about their pool, everything!

The hotel has an excellent location, within 5 minutes of our favourite restaurant! Our room was clean, modern and really spacious. 

We stayed when restrictions were lifting so were able to use their pool. We managed to reserve it the same day and the process was very easy. The staff were so helpful and recommended us a time where the pool would be almost empty. 

A reasonably priced hotel with excellent amenities and impeccable service from the staff. Definitely will be staying again this year!",5,2021,08,02
120,Fantastic staff,"We thoroughly enjoyed our stay at the Hilton Bankside. From our greeting as we arrived to the moment we left all staff were attentive, friendly and always trying to help. We had the Saturday brunch in the restaurant and the Prosecco glass was never allowed to go below half before it was topped up by the efficient and enthusiastic staff. One member of the lunchtime staff called Shaleah made the occasion fun and jolly and couldn’t have been more helpful. The executive lounge staff also made our stay special with their friendliness and attention. Well done Bankside can’t wait to come and stay again.",5,2021,08,01
120,5 night trip to London,Fantastic hotel. Excellent location close to all tourist attractions. Staff are really freindly and professional. Breakfast was fantastic and bar area was chilled. Bedroom was quiet. Stayed in a 2 bedroom family room which was ideal. Complimentary water and mini fridge was a bonus.,5,2021,07,31
120,Date night perfection!,Loved this little hotel! Modern clean bedrooms were fab! Breakfast was amazing. A reasonably priced hotel in a perfect location. We ate out elsewhere for dinner but menu seemed fine. Would like to go back when restrictions have lifted to try the pool.,4,2021,07,30
120,Excellent service,"10 night staycation in London with the family. Staff were courteous, helpful and attentive and it is the excellent helpful staff that are the main making of this hotel. It is also clean and the breakfast is excellent. Good sized swimming pool and gym. We had interconnecting rooms for the kids and us which worked very well. The hotel is also very kid friendly with extras like a ""search the foxes"" activity. There was even a petting zoo came to the hotel on one day we were there.
I cannot recommend this hotel enough.",5,2021,07,30
120,Excellent stay,"I had a 3 night stay here last week ( Wed arrival). As a Diamond member I  was upgraded to a  King Executive Room on the 7th floor ( top  floor). At check in I was offered  a bag of sweets and a cup of water ( I did notice that guests arriving on Friday appeared to have been offered sparkling wine or prosecco ( maybe a Friday thing and was minor) I was able to book a couple of pool sessions ( a health form also had to be filled in each time) for 45mins each.
I was delighted to be advised that the Excecutive lounge has reopened. The lounge is excellent and offers juices, soft drinks and tea/coffee  with savoury crisps  during the day with an excellent range of hot and cold items in the evening  together with alcoholic and non alcoholic drinks served by fantastic staff. The lounge and food were better than in other Hilton hotels I had stayed in the past week ( Conrad and Park Lane Hilton)

The room was large, well appointed and quiet ( courtyard facing) and had slippers and bathrobes as well as a minibar with soft drinks, water and apple crisps -very nice and was complimentary for me) Air conditioning was excellent.
Bathroom was large and well appointed although it was hard to stop some  water from flowing onto the floor  ( bath mat got soaked with water though) Bed was very comfortable.

Breakfast was  self service ( pancakes also available to be made fresh) with lots of hot and cold items with some unusal items ( Prawn cocktail and  Coconut milk) which I had not seen before in other hiltons.

The bar ( Distillery) was excellent and had a great drink ( #149) that was very refreshing on thursday after a hot day sightseeing and a great attendant. Unfortunately on Friday as I wanted another one, I was advised that they were out of the necessay syrup.

All the staff were excellent and friendly.

The location is very good being close to Southwark underground station for the jubliee line ( and access to waterloo east) and a few minutes from the Thames at The Tate Modern ( took me back as my first job was at Bankside house ( now LSE accomodation) and the Millennium  Bridge with great views across the Thames to St Pauls and the City.

There is a Sainsbury's local and Tesco express close by. ( whilst in Tesco one early evening I did overhear that a shopper had attempted to assault a  sainsbury staff member ) but did not see it.  Even coming back later at night  I did not see anything in the area that made me feel even slightly unsafe.
Wifi free for HHmembers.

The pool is excellent and is in the basement. The gym is beside the pool and looked very good  but did not use it as i had spent most of the day sightseeing
Overall an excellet stay with  fantastic facilites ( lounge and breakfast) and great staff and atmosphere",5,2021,07,29
120,Checked out at midnight,Checked out at midnight as it was so bad. Awful hotel. Rude staff who genuinely are “computer says no” and don’t care. Facilities close earlier than advertised hours. Worst Hilton in London with Travelodge standard rooms. Location is also a bit dodgy at night and wouldn’t stay here again.,1,2021,07,28
120,Fabulous hotel,"We stayed for 4 nights at this hotel to spend some time in London. What a wonderful hotel - the staff were incredibly friendly, helpful and welcoming, the room was spacious and immaculately clean and the breakfast was second to none. ",5,2021,07,28
120,Luke & Charlotte,"Fantastic experience! Would highly recommend staying here! Everything from the decor, accommodation and the food quality to the level of Customer Service was extremely satisfying. My Wife had a lovely Birthday! :)",5,2021,07,26
120,The best Bartender ever!! Anne the Bartender,Anne is a great company and excellent bartender! You just have to come to see her in action and taste her drinks! I tried espresso martini and mojitjo! It was fantastic. She is a lovely person with a great mixing skills. Keep up the good work Anne.,5,2021,07,26
120,Beautiful hotel and location,"It was a beating and peaceful hotel, with excellent and super friendly staff that were super accommodating to all my needs. The neighbourhood was full of character, we enjoyed exploring such a fun part of london in walking. The location is perfect for good food and many activities, as the Tate is just next door. Highly recommend staying eg here to enjoy London in both short weekend stays as well as longer!",5,2021,07,26
120,Amazing family stay,"Amazing family stay. We stayed for 6 nights and had a connecting family room sleeping two adults in king room and twin beds in the other room. We had two bathrooms one with a massive walk in shower and the other with a bath and shower. Both rooms were immaculate, water and fizzy drinks, biscuits all restocked every day. The rooms were cleaned every day and everything felt really clean. Due to COVID you had to book a slot for the pool and gym but always managed to get a good slot. The pool is lovely and has a jacuzzi and relaxing area. The gym was immaculate and great equipment. Breakfast set up in a buffet style, so much choice for everyone and always really tasty. We had cocktails inside and outside in the patio area which also had a ping pong table. The hotel location is great and a 8 minute walk to Shakespeare’s Globe and restaurants. The hotel is a bout 10 minutes walk to either Southwark or Blackfriars tube station and 15 minutes walk to Waterloo.",5,2021,07,25
120,Wonderful hotel,"This is our second time staying in Hilton Bankside and I hope it won't be our last. The service is fantastic and the rooms are clean and stylish. We used the pool, which had to be pre-booked due to covid restrictions but we had no issues getting the times we wanted. The breakfasts were excellent with a good variety on offer. This is a beautiful location for a trip to London and we thoroughly enjoyed exploring the area.",5,2021,07,22
120,First and last time,"I’m half way though our week (a few colleagues also staying) and up till now we were mildly pleased with our stay but it has now been ruined. We’ve got executive rooms and Natasha was very welcoming and spoke to myself directly explaining the changes to the room rates etc due to the lounge being shut and also made arrangements to accommodate the most appropriate room that would meet my needs. It’s been really appreciated Natasha, however we were given vouchers to use in the bar for two drinks between 5-9pm, which was much appreciated, although last night spent 15/20 mins sat in the bar before anyone came over to serve us only to then be informed the lounge was open so the bar was no longer accepting vouchers. But then also that the lounge has reduced hours compared to the vouchers that we have been given. So what exactly have we paid extra for? Absolutely nothing, we’ve got 4 more 1 week stays in London this year on business and we will now be looking for somewhere else to stay. Happy to take the money but no customer service since.",2,2021,07,22
120,Incredible stay - loads of lovely touches,"We stayed as a family (2a, 2c) over the weekend of 17 July 2021. The hotel was faultless. As soon as we entered, we were met by Jefferson Camacho (the concierge who was outstanding) and were made to feel incredibly welcome from the outset, giving the children little welcome gifts. When we got to our room, it was hygiene sealed and very clean for our arrival. Our children had fox themed additions in their adjoining room and there were even kids dressing gowns. We used the pool which we had to book but managed to get two 45 minute sessions whilst we were there. There was a fox hunt around the hotel for the children to complete whilst we were there too. Perfect location  too - 5 minute amble round the side of the tate modern to the Thames where you could walk in either direction - to Borough market one way and all the way down the river, past the Globe to embankment and the fun of the Southbank the other way! All in all a wonderful time and I would highly recommend a stay.",5,2021,07,21
120,"Very clean, lovely welcoming team, lovely breakfast! Did I say very clean?","Great stay with the kids! Great welcome! Clean! Only down side not good view in 4th floor of other hotel walls not the city. The choice of breakfast was yummy! From pancakes, waffles, omelettes, very polite and friendly chef and his deputy. ",4,2021,07,18
120,"Family oriented, highly recommend","This is not your average faceless Hilton.  It’s boutique in style, modern, clean, and the service is outstanding.  The concierge made a point of making our 4 year old feel super welcome.  We visited as a family of 3, having booked a family interconnecting room.  We had a corner suite with loads of space and all required amenities (only thing missing was a Nespresso machine, but I’m being fussy!).  Excellent touches includes a welcome bag including soft toy, a child’s robe and slippers for the pool, and complimentary soft drinks in the mini bar.  Location is superb for exploring the best of the capital.  Highly recommend, we will be back!",5,2021,07,17
120,Great hotel!,"Great hotel! Exceptional service, great rooms, great breakfast and gym! 5 star! Have stayed in several rooms and all rooms are great. Restaurant and bar is really nice and the art vibe is very contemporary",5,2021,07,16
120,Fantastic 5 Star Hotel,"Arrived at reception and immediately offered a glass of Prosecco before booking in for my 4 night stay. Full Covid 19 protection with screens and hand sanitiser throughout the hotel. Maximum number of people in the lifts.
Advised at reception regarding the procedure of cleaning the room and for booking the gym and leisure pool.
Breakfast on all 4 mornings was well set out with individual cereal/bran flakes boxed, porridge and hot items served by the chef. Fried and poached eggs cooked to order.
I didn’t have any evening meals as the choice on the hotel doorstep is enormous, Borough Market 400 yards away with restaurants with every type of food available.
Overall a great hotel.",5,2021,07,14
120,An Excellent stay and hotel,"I and my wife stayed at the Hilton London bankside, this weekend, and I have to say the reviews of it from previous guests were spot on. 
From the moment we arrived to the moment we left, the service was excellent. We were offered a glass of prosecco on arrival, I had used a voucher scheme to reserve a king room, that was quickly sorted, the bedroom, the restaurant for breakfast was so well organised, not only did we feel safe, the service exceeded our expectations. 
location was 5 minute walk from Southwark tube station, and nice walk to Borough Market or across the river, was really happy to stay at the hotel and would love to visit again.",4,2021,07,12
120,Weekend break,"Stayed over the weekend at the beginning of June. Not much to say as it was everything I expected from a hotel. Superb location, great room, attending and happy staff. Managed to book a pool slot ( Saturday afternoon) and really enjoyed the breakfast- especially that it was not a table service only - was missing an old fashion good buffets.",5,2021,07,11
120,Fantastic Experience,"I dont think I have ever had as good an experience from a customer service perspective.  The amenities were, albeit not ""over the top"" luxurious, very comfortable with one of the most comfortable beds and well thought out layouts of a room I have experienced (simple things like reading lights, power plug placement, light switch arrangement, etc.  were very well thought through.  During breakfast, everyone was exceptionally friendly, and the front desk staff was happy to help with any request.  The pool was a perfect temperature, and there was water and disinfecting wipes provided daily.  I would happily return on my next business trip.",5,2021,07,11
120,Wonderful stay,"Absolutely spotless, friendly staff and perfect location near Tate modern.
The room was beautiful, bed very comfortable and the staff on reception was nice and chatty. I had a delicious breakfast and very relaxing time.

Thank you for a wonderful stay",5,2021,07,10
120,Beautiful Hotel with lovely staff,"I would like to thank all the staff who looked after us while staying here. The hotel is beautiful, our rooms were lovely and the concierge staff, the reception team, and restaurant staff were so friendly, helpful, and lovely, also room service was fantastic!!
The pool was great also. 
The only one thing missing was I asked for a nice wee touch in the room on arrival for my mums birthday, we did get some complimentary soft drinks which didn't meet my expectations so that was a bit of a let down.",4,2021,07,08
120,Amazing stay at Hilton Bankside,"We - a family of four, with a 5yo and 8yo - had the most fabulous time at the Hilton Bankside. Every single member of hotel staff could not have made us feel more welcome.

Upon arrival the children were given a bag of sweets (after checking with us, of course) and we had a glass of Prosecco. We immediately booked in for the swimming pool (sessions are 45mins on the hour atm) and ten minutes later there was a knock at the door with mini bathrobes and slippers and an activity bag in time for our swim. The slippers and robes were even the right sizes for the children. They were in their element! The swimming pool is really, really nice and the experience will be further improved when COVID requirements are lifted.

The rooms are very large (especially by London standards), quiet and immaculate and the hotel adheres to all COVID requirements. The interconnecting rooms we had were perfect. Breakfast is bountiful and you couldn’t ask for more. The bar is really nicely situated, with both indoor and outdoor options. 

In terms of location, it’s so impressive. We came down from Scotland and the traverse from King’s Cross to Blackfriars is four stops and a short walk to the hotel - it couldn’t have been more convenient. You are also short walks from Southwark station, Waterloo station, St Paul’s,  spitting distance to the Tate Modern and there are dozens of restaurants and cafes on your doorstep. Had it not been for the children I think we would have walked everywhere we had wanted to go and not taken the tube at all.

The stay at Hilton Bankside was one of the most positive hotel experiences I’ve ever had and I wouldn’t hesitate to stay here again. If you’re considering booking I would  book ASAP while the rates are stupendous for what you get. The staff really want you to be there and genuinely want you to have the best time ever. Thanks guys :)",5,2021,07,07
120,Excellent,"Quality oozes from every aspect of my experience of Hilton Bankside.

Friendly and professional staff, beautiful decor, immaculately clean. Amazing bar and restaurant. Also - housekeeping only when you ask!",5,2021,07,05
120,Superb location,Really peaceful hotel right in the heart of things.  Lots on the doorstep and the heart of the city a quick walk across the Thames.  All staff were brilliant and I felt genuinely welcomed.  Shame that the exec lounge was shut but this was made up for with a most enjoyable bento box and drinks.  I’ll be back!,5,2021,07,05
120,Covid Break,"+ve 

- Centrally located - walking distance to Borough Market, Tate Modern etc. 
- Decent breakfast options with attentive staff who all observe Covid protocols 
- Gym was reasonable, we had to book 45 min windows to use the gym which meant you get the gym floor yourself.
- Rooms are spacious with very comfortable bedding. 

-ve
- Would like to see elimination of the small plastic bottles of toiletries. Such a waste of plastic.
- Fire alarm went off at 2am and required evacuation which is totally fine, but we were unable to rerun to our room as the fire door to our corner room would not open and required drilling through the lock. Malfunctioning fire doors isn't very reassuring. 

Subjective
- Generally a very nice city hotel but lacked a little atmosphere.",4,2021,07,05
120,Hotel bankside,"Very welcoming on arrival and offered  a glass of Prosecco as we had a delay getting in our room we got offered another glass.  

Hotel nice and clean all staff helpful and friendly.

Rooms are spacious and the bed is very comfortable.

Complimentary robes slippers and an umbrella.",5,2021,07,04
120,You won’t regret it! SUPER FAMILY FRIENDLY,"You won’t regret booking here. Our stay was beyond our expectations. The rooms were really clean, spacious (especially for it being in London) and modern. Since we stayed with our 2 young children, They had little welcome baggies for the kids with a cute fox and other things. Not to mention a robe and slippers for our little girl, which was a great touch. Also the crib they provided was a clean, proper wooden one. Every single employee we came in contact with were beyond helpful and nice. During these times, they’ve taken all precautions and made our stay feel safe and enjoyable at the same time. The breakfast was great with a lot of variety! Can’t stress enough how great this hotel is.",5,2021,07,02
120,5 stars ,"We are so glad we booked this hotel. The room was a great size, the bed was so comfortable. We didn't book breakfast but we did go to the bar for lunch and the food was really lovely. 
The location was great, so much nearby. We are glad we managed to fit in a visit to the pool it was relaxing after a busy few days. 
All the staff we encountered were so helpful and polite, we even got late checkout which was a little added bonus.
Would definitely return. ",5,2021,06,29
120,Quality Stay,"First visit  and definitely not the last. Staff and facilities deserve a 10 out of 10
We were very happy with the rooms. Very spacious and quality bed. Best sleep every
Power shower to die for could have stayed for ever ",5,2021,06,28
120,Family friendly nice hotel.,"Super family friendly hotels.  Located just behind Tate Modern, about 10 minutes walk to nearest tube station across Blackfriars Bridge. 

Offered prosecco on check-in and children given a large bag of sweets (although would say that these were not the most appropriate treats for 3 and 5 year olds, haribo type things would have been better better hard sucky sweets but a nice touch).  Check-in was perhaps biggest let down of hotel as we were stood waiting for about 20 minutes. 

We had a family connecting room, so a king and twin with adjoining door, two bathrooms, one with shower and one with bath.  Rooms modern. Clean. Not that large but big enough.  Beds comfortable.  Quiet. Minibar with complementary water, lemonade and some artisan cola which was pretty grim! Tea and coffee making facilities.   Hilton gold member, not offered upgrade even though room was available :( but as far as I understand lounge closed at moment anyway.  

Breakfast was a covid friendly buffet.  Hot options including made to order eggs and pancakes, sausages, bacon, potatoes and beans.  Cereal and yoghurt with individual sealed pots of nuts/dried fruit/seeds/fresh fruit.  Pastries were a bit of a let down.  Overall excellent. 

Swimming pool in basement, good size.  Could be a touch warmer.  Has to be booked on arrival but we managed to book twice in our 2 night stay with no problems.

Staff all very friendly and chatty. Asset to hotel. 

Very child friendly.  Size appropriate dressing gowns and slippers delivered to room along with a bag containing a fox toy, colouring, jelly beans and children's toiletries.  Colouring also delivered to table at breakfast. 

Would definitely stay here again. ",5,2021,06,27
120,Hilton backside,"Lovely place to stay, all staff very helpful. Jefferson extremely so. Highly recommend and I will stay again for sure. I would also recommend the bottomless brunch, staff are very friendly and couldn’t have done anymore for us.",5,2021,06,27
120,"A good hotel, some improvements to be made","This trip started off so well, the Hilton app allowing you to get a room key and communicate with staff is excellent. I forgot my toothpaste, some was brought to the room within minutes. I booked a swim nice and easily, check in was fine although we were disappointed to have booked an executive room with lounge access only to learn the lounge was closed. I also stupidly left my mobile in the room which the team were excellent at resolving, thank you.  

The pool is wonderful and clean and I would like to stress I would stay here again, but perhaps not when the football is on 🙄

The negatives:

1) we asked last minute to book a conference room to complete some work, the team seemed very disinterested in this and after about 45 minutes we abandoned cause and worked in the work space in reception. A large group then checked in who had clearly been drinking and brought their own speaker which was blaring and made it impossible, again the staff were ineffective in handling this 

2) the bar - I am not sure how this is linked to the restaurant but we went in, we’re rudely told we had to go and sit down (fine, covid) we then waited twenty minutes before even brought a menu and eventually had to abandon it. 

3) breakfast services was excellent but the food wasn’t great. There are a lot of options however and we only tried it on the last day.",3,2021,06,27
120,Great Hotel,We really enjoyed our stay at the Hilton Bankside. We especially liked Domenico from the in room service dining! He was very accommodating and brought us room service at our connivence. Highly recommended!,5,2021,06,27
120,Amazing family weekend away,"We spent one night here for Father's Day and had the most wonderful 24 hours! From the minute we checked in, we were made to feel so welcome with prosecco on check-in (including top-ups!) and biscuits and sweets for the kids - they felt so special!

Natasha in particular was absolutely brilliant, so accommodating with our requests to have rooms near our friends and to book a pool slot at the same time, and she also moved our brunch booking the next day to enable us to have time to get changed after our swimming session.

Nothing at all was ever too much effort and we absolutely loved our family interconnecting rooms too - the best we've stayed in so far as a family. The  arrival of special goodie bags, dressing gowns and slippers for the kids later on in the day was the icing on the cake!

Thanks so much for such a wonderful weekend, we will be back.",5,2021,06,25
120,Staff are amazing ,"WOW I have been to many Hilton stays as a gold member this was far the best service. Very good welcome on arrival and wished me happy birthday straight away and a lovely room upgrade and it was a lovely room, bar, breakfast very nice. Good Covid policy. So would recommend to stay very central to travel around London,  Borough Market, Thames for river cruise ",5,2021,06,25
120,Another great stay,"I am a returning customer to this hotel and can’t find fault in any way. The staff on arrival were polite and professional and met us with a drink and a treat.

Checkin was fast and simple and they even found some superglue to fix my partners shoe.

The room was clean and tidy as expected and felt very comfortable. Gadgets in the room included a Bose speaker system and a large tv as well as a fridge and hair dryer. Couldn’t ask for too much more.

Made use of the bath robes supplied in the room and booked a pool session at reception. The booking was socially distanced with plenty of space for those who booked the slot. Clean towels were available at the poolside for use after the swim.

Staff in the hotel bar were friendly and polite and the drinks delivered to the table in good time. 

Happy to return to this hotel for another stay in the future.",5,2021,06,24
120,Dissapointing,"We stayed here on Saturday 20th for fathers day, it was a surprise booking.  The hotel informed us that it has ample parking for disabled blue badge holders and that it was free.  Upon arrival we learned there is no parking at the hotel and it down the road from the hotel at £40 per night.  We checked in fairly easy, room was ok, but not what you come to expect for a 5 star hotel.  I had informed the staff that my son is autistic and would require certain foods which they told me is fine as they have a range of foods on offer for kids.  The restaurant was CLOSED, we had to go to the bar area for our meal, no kids menu at all and the staff in there were rude when i asked if there was a kids menu.  There were no time slots available for him to swim until gone 12pm which is check out time.  All in all not a great experience at all.",1,2021,06,21
120,Family Friendly Trip,"From the moment we arrived the gentlemen in reception were attentive to the children and gave them a drink and colouring sheet to occupy them whilst we checked in.  We were in an interconnecting room and everything had been thought off.  The curtains were totally blacked out, there was a nightlight in both rooms, it was clean and quiet.  There was a lovely shower room in our side and a bath in the children’s side.  There was plenty of choice at breakfast and everything was fresh.  We used the pool which we booked on to easily and the children loved it.  I think the booking system is good as it was never too busy.  Wonderful to have superb customer service in a lovely setting.",5,2021,06,20
120,Worth the hype,"This hotel is always raved about on the Hilton Forums and typically rated as the best Hilton in London.  I was attending an event on Park Lane and thought I would see what all the fuss was about. 

Hotel is a 5 minute walk from Southwark station (which is a direct link to Green Park station).   On the way to the hotel, you pass a couple of lovely pubs and both Tesco and Sainsbury’s local stores.  I was recognised as a Diamond Honors member on check in and upgraded to an executive room.  Beautiful room.  As others have said, the executive lounge is closed but was given a couple of drinks vouchers for the bar and a ‘Bento’ box of snacks.  Great alternative.  The bar was lovely with a great outside space. 

Room on the 2nd floor had loads of space, comfy bed, free minibar (no alcohol though) and great shower.  Breakfast buffet in the restaurant was brilliantly done.  Every member of staff I came into contact with was exceptional and a credit to the hotel. 

Will be back when the lounge is open but in the meantime, I highly recommend this hotel.  Worth the hype.",5,2021,06,15
120,The best Hilton in town:,"Not just the best Hilton, but our favourite hotel in London by a good stretch. Always at a sensible price despite being a luxury experience from the moment you arrive to the end of your stay, which always comes too soon.

We chose to spend the weekend here to celebrate my 30th and we couldn't have been better looked after. Between the head concierge, John, and their front desk lead Zusanah, the team really couldn't do enough for us. They met us with fizz on arrival, arranged for an upgrade to a lovely suite, sorted our car and luggage seamlessly, and even remember and left a little surprise with breakfast on my actual birthday. They've even got a couple of very decent bikes you can borrow instead of renting a ""boris bike"" which are a far nicer way to get around when simple got to nip out for a bit of shopping.

Having a booking system for the pool and gym means these are still available despite the ongoing covid regulations, and whilst the Executive Lounge is still closed (no alcoholic buffets allowed until stage 4!) they have recognised this and offered up some vouchers for the bar instead. It's not the same, but it's a nice nod towards what was often a free perk in the first place. 

There are plenty of bars and restaurants locally that will suit most tastes, if you fancy a change from the lovely surroundings of their own ""Distillery"" bar and patio space, and the rest of the Southbank with Shakespeare's Globe and the Tate Modern is few minutes walk away, and only a short stumble home when your night is over.

My other half has already extracted a promise of a weekend here for her own birthday later in the year, so I can definitely say we'll be back! ",5,2021,06,14
120,Not 5 star experience,"For a 5-star hotel I can only give 2 stars right now. When we arrived the keys weren't working for any person/room. It took more than 5 hours for them to fix it. Then, during the night, at 2AM, the fire alarm of the entire hotel activated. This woke up me, my wife and our baby, who couldn't sleep for 2 hours after that. We left the hotel worse than we arrived. It was supposed to be a relaxing time. The hot water makes huge noise when you open the tap... Ah, about the pool, people will just book all slots available in advance so that you can't book a slot even for next morning. We had to go late in the evening to ""enjoy"" that. The brunch is not so bad but very expensive for what is offered there. The outdoor pub ""doesn't"" have highchair for children it seems...",2,2021,06,14
120,Very Good Hilton,"Hilton Bankside is one of my favourite hotels in London. It is clean, modern and staff are accommodating, warm and friendly.

We was offered a glass of fizz upon check in and our room was ready early. 
Beds are large and very comfy and room was very quiet.
Breakfast is fantastic and stands out from many other Hiltons
Unfortunately the executive lounge is still closed and the 2 vouchers which offered a very small glass of wine or a single shot of spirit and one bento box to share was very disappointing.
We like to use the gym and swimming pool and a slot was booked for us by the friendly front desk staff, this  was great as we practically had the place to ourselves.
Overall another fantastic stay big thank you to all the great staff especially Zusana and Kim.",5,2021,06,14
120,Hilton Bankside - what a disapointment,"I have been to Hilton Bankside many times and always was impressed, especially with the Executive Lounge,

on my recent visit on May Bank Holiday we booked 3 nights again in an Exec room.
while i appreciated that the experience during COVID would be different, i wasn't prepared for just how poor the experience would be.

We were offered a voucher for 2 drinks each per evening in the bar (fair enough) however the quality of the wine was disgusting and undrinkable. The other vouchers we didn't bother using.
food was a Bento box, which we didn't eat. it consisted of  small portions of some olives tuna and other bits. (absolutely terrible)

Hilton would have been better to offer us a voucher to spend in the restaurant, as it was we eat out and Hilton lost out",2,2021,06,12
120,Lovely weekend break,"We really enjoyed our Stay here. The room as lovely, clean and modern. 

We were welcomed with a glass of fizz and a quick check in. We attended brunch at Oxbo bank side which I can’t recommend enough.
Hotel was clean but didn’t feel abnormal in these COVID times - it was nice how they’d managed to implement safety without it overbearing on our experience. 
Breakfast was great in the morning with lots of choice. 
Every member of staff was helpful and friendly. 
Can’t wait to stay again! ",5,2021,06,07
120,"Very family friendly, nice hotel in great location ","Stayed for a weekend. Great location - a few mins walk to the Thames and 20 mins or so in either direction to London eye/tower bridge, but in a nice calmer, quiet pocket of London. Breakfast was fab - lots of hot and cold buffet choices and friendly, efficient staff. 
Extremely family friendly but still luxurious. Stayed with a 6 year old and he was delighted with the sweet treats on arrival and fox teddy in his room. The interconnecting rooms work well for a family stay too. Rooms were on the small side, but very comfortable, modern, quiet and well equipped. 
Friendly, polite reception/door staff that always had a welcome smile and chat with the 6 year old. 
Had a couple early evening drinks on  the terrace of Oxbo bar. Very pleasant - a sunny, post lockdown weekend and all the thameside pubs were ridiculously busy, but Oxbo was relaxed and roomy! 
Highly recommend and would book again if staying in London. ",5,2021,06,06
120,Great hotel for a family visit to London,"Great weekend stay at the hotel. One of the best family room set-ups we have experienced, especially with older children (10+). Super comfy beds. The goodie bags for the children were an extra special touch. No problem booking a slot for the pool, and it was enjoyed by all of us. Tasty breakfast with plenty of options for everyone. Super friendly and helpful staff throughout the hotel. Would highly recommend and hope to visit again soon!",5,2021,06,06
120,Great hotel in Bankside,"Stayed here with my wife after a night out in London. 
The check in was smooth and efficient, especially liked the complimentary glass of Prosecco! 
The bar is great with outdoor seating available. Service was a little slow here, but drinks were good. 
The hotel is very model. Excellent appearance and ambience generally
We found it hard to find any faults at all at this place. Recommended",4,2021,06,06
120,Great stay,"We had a great stay. Such comfortable beds, great bathrooms, good black out curtains. Breakfast is top notch and all the staff are friendly and kind. Makes such a huge difference. The complimentary Prosecco for adults and sweets for the kids on arrival is a lovely touch. My only (slight) niggle is that some families seem to receive toy foxes, child size robes etc in their rooms but we didn’t have any of that. Perhaps an oversight?",5,2021,06,06
120,Wonderful 100% !!,"Wonderful service throughout. The staff can't do enough for you, nothing is too much trouble. The pool is wonderful. You get a slotted time of approx 1 hour. You can book this on check in. We had a family room, which was two interconnected rooms, lots of space and absolutely lovely. The fridges were great for storing food and there were complimentary beverages. The breakfast was superb. All in all...would highly recommend and looking forward to our next stay. Southwark tube is approx 4 min walk away.",5,2021,06,06
120,Great family minibreak,"We stayed here for a mini break with 2 young children. From beginning to end the staff were fantastic, little touches like drinks on arrival, sweets for the kids and fun bags with fox toys in.

The staff made us feel really welcome and gave the children lots of attention and accommodated. 

Facilities are top, family adjoining room works well. Bar area great in the evening and breakfast was really good too.

Will be staying again!",5,2021,06,06
120,Great to be back,So nice to be back at this hotel which is one of my favourites in London.  The staff here are just wonderful. Special mention to Zuzana who is an asset to the hotel. The room - one bed suite - was excellent. Housekeeping was exceptional. Bar staff - especially Anabella - were great. Please just open the lounge up again. There’s no need for it to still be closed and I’d be interested in management feedback here - you can still social distance just as much as you can in your bar. Let’s get back to normal please Bankside! Overall a great stay.,5,2021,06,05
120,Relaxing stay,Stayed a couple of weeks ago. Very friendly staff and very helpful. The breakfast wasn't great but the staff were very good about sorting it out. The pool is great and the rooms spacious .super comfy beds,5,2021,06,05
120,"Hotel nice, booking experience poor","Booking experience was one of the worst when trying to book a linking family room plus another room. However, the hotel is lovely, staff helpful and bathrooms are lovely. A bit more plush than your typical Hilton,  Does the job for a couple of days in London,",4,2021,06,05
120,Perfect weekend,The Hilton Bankside is in a brilliant location just minutes from the Tate Modern and the Southbank. It really feels like an oasis of calm as soon as you step inside and the design is beautiful. The hotel manages to create an intimate boutique atmosphere but at the same time offer all of the facilities you would expect from a 5 star hotel.  The staff are super friendly and attentive and can’t do enough for you. The Covid protocols are spot on but don’t compromise the experience in any way. All in all a fab weekend - my kids can’t wait to return.,5,2021,06,05
120,Best Hilton in London !!!!,"Totally fantastic !! From reception check in , breakfast service ( Maria ), hotel bar (Alex from Bulgaria ), bar supervisor , hotel manager .. amazing staff , all of them so professional and welcoming .. what a team !! 
Hotel immaculate , nothing too much trouble , beds amazing , rooms spotless .. and what a location .. the south bank is fab , restaurants and bars all walking distance , the Tate and south walk tube .. excellent place .. must be the best run Hilton in London .. massively recommend .. you will not be disappointed .. what a wonderful break away we have had !!!",5,2021,06,01
120,"Clean, comfy, modern great hotel","This was our 4th time staying with 7 of us. Each time we have had a really good experience but would
say this time the staff have been the friendliest. They have gone above what is expected on arrivals, helping with taxis, talking to children etc. 
Even with current restrictions we have really enjoyed the stay. 
We used the pool which the children loved I would say try to book early to avoid disappointment as limited availability. 
Room service was great. And staff in the bar were so friendly especially one man - not sure of his name but he was from Marseille France. Shame the lounge wasn’t open but the bento boxes, and comp drinks were nice, would have been good if had an different bento box option for kids as not really great for them. 
Rooms were really clean and tea, coffee etc well stocked. Beds were exceptionally comfy! They are all feather pillows, duvets and we needed to move my mother in law to a room due to allergies which was done so quickly and without hesitation so that was very appreciated, as I hadn’t even thought to check.
Overall would really recommend this hotel it is modern, clean and staff are great. It is also in a lovely area, right next to some supermarkets, loads of restaurants and a short walk to a lot of attractions.",5,2021,06,01
120,The staff are amazing,"We have stayed in this hotel lots because the staff really look after us. Nothing is ever too much trouble and are needs are always met. The bar is child friendly  and the club sandwich and burger are a must. The staff are attentive and very friendly. If you are in need of help David at reception is your man. He is very knowledgeable and helpful. 
Would definitely recommend this Hilton hotel.",5,2021,05,31
120,Still a favourite,"I used to stay in London a lot with work and always tried to stay here if I could because it was one of my favourites.
I’d not been for a while and wondered what it would be like since covid and I’m pleased to say it’s still as good as ever.
The staff are all very friendly and helpful, the rooms excellent, the location great on the South Bank. 
The pool was open and was most welcome - Even the loud screaming kids couldn’t ruin it.
Sadly the Exec lounge isn’t open yet but there drinks vouchers instead.",5,2021,05,30
120,Good but could have been great,"It’s really disappointing when hotels use Covid as an excuse to not offer service. Asked about upgrade on check in and was told nothing available as all rooms booked (contrary to what the site said). I then asked about paid upgrades and was given several options (all more expensive as an upgrade than it would have been to book the whole room price directly). Such a shame as everything else was so good. 

Room was very comfortable. I loved the pillow so much I asked if I could buy one!

The bar staff were good and the Bento box was the first time a Hilton has properly made up for an exec lounge being closed (although hopefully it’ll re-open soon).

Staff were generally super nice at breakfast, reception and the bar, although the concierge was no more use than an internet search. 

I’d stay again although fingers crossed the exec lounge is open and there’s no more covid as an excuse for poor service nonsense. I’m already looking forward to another good nights sleep.",4,2021,05,27
120,Good location,"This hotel offers  a good location and the rooms are average .  In additions, the pool was fully booked which was very disappointing as we were made to believe it would be and we could book a time on arrival . Food was not good value for money ",3,2021,05,25
120,Commendable service and accmmodation,"We had our wedding reception at this hotel. That was the first day after UK covid restriction was ease up a bit that they allow a number of guests for indoor events.
I would like to thank their events and management department and reservations team for the exceptional service they offered us.

Rooms: CLEAN, decent price, spacious, and excellent location ( near convenient and grocery stores as well)

Just highlight and thank Mr Atkinson (who handled our event flawlessly), Mr Zul, Mr. Spinelli (who was serving us on the day of the reception) - these guys are amazing.

Could not wait to stay more!",5,2021,05,24
120,Exceptional we can not wait to return,"Exceptional we can not wait to return! 

We arrived on a Friday morning for the weekend, I am 7 months pregnant and not the most comfortable, David at the front desk very kindly provided us with a diamond upgrade so that I had a bath available which made all of the difference after miles of walking each day.

Our room was excellent, immaculate, the bed was extremely comfortable and it was very spacious. Breakfast was perfect, great choice very friendly staff and chef and a wonderful restaurant and atmosphere. 

The business lounge has not yet reopened, however we were given two drinks and a bento box each, which we could enjoy in the bar or our room between 5pm and 9pm which was a great alternative. 

We booked our pool times each morning for the next day and had a great hour in the pool with a limited number of people making for a relaxing experience. 

We have been staying at Hiltons consistently for around 6 years. Since becoming diamond members, we have stayed in a range of Hiltons from home2suites to the Waldorf line and I can honestly the team at this hotel are one of the best we have come across. We originally booked the Waldorf London but the staff were so obnoxious and rude at booking a few days later I asked my husband if he minded a change to bankside as we wanted pool facilities but planning a break from a high pressured day to day job and life I certainly did not have the paitence for rude staff, and I am so glad we changed. 

On top of everything I have already mentioned the gentleman Shenun (I am so sorry if I have the spelling incorrect, and the concierge who's name we unfortunately did not make a note of also made our stay extra special. They were so attentive with our 7 year old, chatting to him, providing him with sweets when we arrived and even brining him a children's robe for his pool visit it made his stay extra special and meant the world to us as it was actually a birthday treat for him. 

The running of the hotel during these strange times was excellent, wonderfully executed and very much appreciated, we felt a sense of relaxation and normality for a few days. 

Thanks to an awesome team it really did enhance our stay and make for a perfect weekend. We can not wait to return.",5,2021,05,23
120,Fantastic,"Perfect! The hotel was lovely, as soon as we arrived the staff were so welcoming and informative. The general hotel decor is lovely, modern and clean. Our queen deluxe room was spacious and comfortable with more than enough space, the amenities were generous and particularly the room had a lovely big shower. Breakfast was fantastic and to finish of a lovely stay the pool was the icing on the cake. Thoroughly enjoyed our stay and can’t want to return!",5,2021,05,23
120,Great family hotel in the centre of London,"recently stayed at Bankside with my wife and son and had an amazing time. The communication was excellent, the room was perfect and the breakfast was diverse and wholesome.

Our son loved the little fox teddy bear they left in the room for him.

Love staying here, it is always my 1st choice hotel in london.",5,2021,05,19
120,"Great Hotel, Brillant Location","I am a seasoned traveller, favouring Hilton hotels for my stays whenever possible and I must say, this is one of the best ones I stayed at. The hotel is well situated and quiet. The staff members were willing to go above and beyond to make guests feel welcome and safe. The room was clean and room service excellent. I would highly recommend this hotel.",5,2021,05,07
120,Really good hotel,"Stayed there on a business trip in March 2021 as a Diamond member. I have received a warm welcome on my arrival and was offered a deluxe room upgrade which was the best room the hotel has offered at the time. Zuzanna and Vanessa from the receiption team were really friendly and helpful.  

The room is quite large for the London standards and the king bed was really comfy. The desk was really good as a working space with enough power plugs around the whole room. Bathroom was really clean, but there was a large shower in the place of a bath.   

Due to Covid-19 restrictions, I did not get any opportunity to try out the exec lounge or the pool. Breakfast was very limited and the hotel only offered some pastry with a bottle of orange juice. I found it very poor compared to a warm breakfast offered by Hilton Metropole during my stay there a couple days later. 

The hotel has some good transport links around, but they all require some walking (Southwark - 10 mins, Waterloo East - 15 mins, Blackfriars - 10 mins, London Bridge - 15mins). All of those stations are accessible. 

All in all, I really enjoyed my stay at Hilton Bankside and I would definitely return there again, even for a leisure trip when all Covid restrictions are lifted.",5,2021,05,03
120,Excellent on all fronts,"Stayed two nights on business and thought this a great hotel. Ticks all the boxes- location tucked behind Tate modern is very convenient, room well designed, spacious and comfortable, powerful and roomy shower and excellent breakfast- photos attached- during my stay room service only due to the pandemic. Hope to return soon. ",5,2021,05,01
120,Very good - more could be done for customer loyalty ,"I’ve stayed at this hotel a few times before and it is always one of my favourites in London. 

During my stay in mid April, the lounge and restaurant are still closed; however they do have a nice outdoor terrace which is open and the staff working there were great. 

Room service was excellent and thanks to Domenico who was very friendly and courteous. 

I’m a Diamond member and I was left curious as to the benefits available during my stay: paid to upgrade to a suite as only a very basic upgrade was offered with no real difference in room quality, which I thought was unusual given the hotel was so quiet. No premium WiFi offered, no drinks vouchers for the bar, nothing. 

Breakfast offering is very poor - a pastry, orange juice and an apple delivered to the room in a paper bag. I think more could have been offered, even under the circumstances. 

Thank you to Thomas on the front desk who was helpful and did his best to make my stay an enjoyable one. 

Hopefully on my next visit to the hotel, more will be offered to loyal customers as I found this inconsistent with other Hilton chains. 

I’m looking forward to the Exec Lounge reopening as it is truly a wonderful lounge and way ahead of the competition. 

The room itself (King Junior Suite) was very clean and comfortable. 
",4,2021,04,16
120,Unsatisfactory,Wasn’t what I expected view wasn’t nice smelt like cannibis on the second floor where we resided also door banging smell of food from deliveries outside doors my toilet didn’t flush properly also pubic hair on seat receptionist was rather abrupt overall not valued for money as facilities weren’t available to use ,2,2021,04,11
120,Great one night stay!!!,"I checked in for one night due to having no water in my apartment. Really pleased with my choice of hotel - what a nice surprise. 

Receptionist really friendly, the room service guy was so nice, shower big and good water pressure and the bed was comfortable. 

Tip - ask for a room that doesn’t face the wall and has some view. No drama for me though ",5,2021,04,08
120,Great Hotel,"I stayed in this hotel as it was near a work interview but if your after a quick trip into the west end you will need to taxi its central but but not that central and was so pleased, service was fantastic from check in to check out and was everything I look for in a hotel which is  quiet and a decent shower ( im pretty tall ). I liked the hotel that much I booked again for end of April and plan on asking my gf to marry me there",5,2021,04,01
120,Seven flawless days,"I came to this hotel because I am moving home and the new house is not ready yet. The structure is good, the rooms clean and spacious, but I noticed that the difference is made by the staff which in my opinion is the strong point of this structure. I found them all available, empathetic and attentive to my every request. In particular Domenico from the Room Service was fantastic in the attention to detail, in the way he served me and even advised me when I had doubts about the menu. The breakfast is always abundant. Thanks to all",5,2021,03,28
120,Visit,It was lovely visit it would have been better if there was entertainment for my children or something to get them out of my hair for abit  and enjoy the time with my wife . Other then that  I would highly recommend the hotel to friends .,4,2021,03,03
120,"Come for the Breakfast, stay for the experience.","Personally have found the Hilton chain has responded rather poorly to the service they offer in this covid era.

Clearly things need to change but I genuinely can’t see why Hilton’s can’t offer basics like a cooked breakfast.

So it’s this that attracted us to this hotel.

Located just a few minutes from the Tate and River Thames. A short walk from Blackfriars, Southwark and Waterloo stations this hotel is located close enough to everything BUT not in a massively busy part of London.

Handful of local supermarkets, M&S foods and chain coffee shops, there are also a few eating locations within a short walk. London Bridge and Borough markets are a short walk / bus ride away. As are the hospitality along the Thames between Blackfriars and Waterloo.

Plus of course the hotel has its own restaurant.

Arrived and was greeted by a cheerful staff member. Hand sanitiser, face masks, screens are all standard in this era and were evident. Greeted with a cup of mulled wine and a mince pie we were quickly checked in and on our way to our third floor room.

Things were explained, breakfast in the morning, need to book swimming.

Being a 5 star hotel, the expectations are the rooms are of a good standard. This didn’t disappoint. 

Being located in a semi residential, semi office, semi tourist area you won’t get a fantastic view from your room, we had an inner view.

Room was spotless, as is the minimum requirement and still had the toiletries supplied. Couple bottles of water in the largish fridge.

Tv with a good range of tv channels and decent WiFi round off the rooms.

Breakfast, the reason for our stay was well organised. Staff attentive and place was spotless.

You help yourself to drinks and cold items and all hot food was supplied by the kitchen staff. Only minor gripe is if you wanted your eggs anyway other than scrambled you had to wait. But it’s a minor gripe. The food was hot and tasty. The portions the staff give you are plentiful. Quality of food was in keeping with the 5 star hotel. And yes the scrambled eggs were tasty.

I really don’t get why the rest of London’s Hilton’s can’t offer similar. Maybe they should visit here when it reopens to see how it can be done safely.

And sadly, that’s the finale. Since our visit london has gone into Tier 3. I walked past the hotel (work in the area) and found it closed for a few days.

I hope that it reopens soon, and the staff - who are a credit to the management - are all well. 

When things improve and trips can resume, would love to come back and hope to be back as soon as Covid is in a retreat in London.

",5,2020,12,18
120,Nice hotel but don't bother with a lounge access room,"The hotel is really nice, I'd definitely stay there again but there were a couple of minor issues. Everything is new and clean. The bar/reception area is nice and the staff are friendly. The only downside is the lack of lounge access because of Covid. I understand why it's closed, but they shouldn't be selling 'lounge access' rooms when its been closed for weeks with no sign of re-opening any time soon. Its closure wasn't mentioned on the Hilton website, only when we arrived at the hotel, at which point we we're given six vouchers in lieu of lounge access - each voucher entitled us to two house drinks and a snack box in the hotel bar. This is a nice gesture but I'd rather have saved the money and downgraded our room type because I imagine all of their rooms are nice and the difference in room price may be more than what the six drinks are worth. We weren't asked if we wanted to downgrade, we were just given the vouchers and that was that. Also, make sure you ask for some kind of view when you check in. I know it's in a relatively quiet area and surrounded by office/apartment blocks, but if you don't ask, you run the risk (like us) of facing a brick wall. Without exaggerating the view was like looking out on to a prison exercise yard where your surrounded by high walls and all you have is the sky above. This obviously won't be an issue if your room is on the outside of the building, but I'd just recommend you ask when you check in. The hotel is about a 10 minute walk from Borough Market. There's also a Tesco Express and Sainsbury's just outside the entrance. If you're not having breakfast at the hotel, there's plenty of places to get something within a minute's walk.",4,2020,12,15
120,"Hotel is nice, don't book Executive rooms","Hotel was nice in general, however I book Executive room with access to Executive lounge, however it was closed due to COVID-19, which is understandable. Received voucher for cold snacks in the box and for couple of drinks with very limited availability. Complained, but no one got back. 
There was no single word at the time of booking a room that lounge is not available, however they sell it at a normal price.",2,2020,11,25
120,Great location in my old stomping ground,"A visit during stage 2 covid in London. With family. Managed to book the pool for 7am . Great facility. Rooms very good to Hilton standard . Restaurant closed but eat in bar very nice. A handy location to get around London,",4,2020,11,10
120,A great hotel !,"We stayed at the Hilton Bankside for one night before lockdown for our last night out in London for a while. We had adjoining rooms for us and our 2 children. The hotel was great ! The staff were super friendly at check in ( a lovely lady on the front desk ) and made us feel very welcome. The rooms were really nice and comfortable large beds and well equipped bathrooms. We had drinks in the bar and had a really nice time. Breakfast was excellent, really good quality food and again the staff were so so friendly and helpful. We also managed to book in a morning swim
With the kids. If we could we would have stayed for longer and will definitely return for a weekend stay as soon as we are allowed !",5,2020,11,06
120,GOLDEN WEDDING CELEBRATIONS,"We have just returned from the London Hilton, Bankside hotel.  Our Golden Wedding was celebrated here in real style!  From check in to check out we were treated exceptionally well.  

The staff are trained to a very high standard, they all go the extra mile to make the stay perfect.

We would like to make a special mention of the following people.  Raoul, Joshua, Michela, Domenico.  There are other team members who deserve a mention so hope we haven't missed anyone out, by simply not recording their names.

Lee and I will certainly return as soon as we can and will not hesitate to recommend this hotel.",5,2020,11,02
120,We love this hotel,"We have visited this hotel several times and we love it, so it was an obvious choice for my birthday break.  The hotel is pricey for what it is, but consistent. The beds are super comfortable and the staff always excellent. The breakfast is first class, but certainly over-priced. The chef was brilliant and happy to cook whatever we wanted. The hotel was very clean and Covid-secure measures were in place. Sadly, the pool (obviously working at a reduced capacity) was booked out as there was a half term splash promotion on that we weren’t aware of. It would be nice if our loyalty to this hotel was rewarded, which it wasn’t, but we will return anyway.",4,2020,11,01
120,Lovely hotel,"Enjoyed staying here, staff were excellent, but couldn’t use the pool as it was already fully booked for most of the day when we dropped our bags off at 9:20am (and one of the reasons we booked this hotel). A couple of other minor issues whilst there, but would stay here again!",4,2020,10,31
120,Fantastic stay!,"Had 2 rooms when we took my elderly mum away for a short lockdown break. 

Great location, superb facilities really helpful staff.  Not normally a fan of corporate hotels but we would certainly stay here again. Couldn’t really fault anything (actually a couple of really minor things that I am sure would have been put right if we had asked). 

Thank you and thanks again for helping out with finding a room with a bath for my mum’s 83rd birthday. She was so delighted with that and has been telling everyone!",5,2020,10,27
120,Not one single complaint,"Stayed here as a surprise birthday present for my husband. 

First time at the hotel and I loved everything about it. Excellent service, amazing breakfast, beautiful rooms. 

Didn’t get a chance to eat in the the restaurants, but have decided to come back again in 2 weeks with the children as it seems like a very family friendly hotel. 

Location is perfect for the southbank it’s just a 10 minute walk to all the attractions. ",5,2020,10,27
120,Amazing,Had a fantastic 3 night stay here to celebrate my 40th birthday. Hotel is in a really good location and the hotel is superb. Breakfast is super too. Love the bathroom and the speaker in the bathroom so you can listen to tv while getting ready. Staff can’t do enough for you. Would definitely return,5,2020,10,23
120,Lovely place,"Great Hotel and also very good location within walking distance from London Bridge and Waterloo stations. Our rooms were spotless clean and very comfortable ,  deco is very modern . Hotel is very covid safe!!!! Hand sanitiser we found everywhere - temperature check on arrival. Extremely nice and helpful staff , and appreciate to all staff members  to keep every corner of the restaurant, room , corridors, lifts in perfect cleanliness! Well done !!!!!! Also  thanks to Kristina from the reception who did everything to make us feel special!",5,2020,10,21
120,Great hotel ,"Hotel was spotless as expected. The welcome was warm, friendly and efficient. Our room was comfortable with high quality furniture and decor, a fantastically comfortable bed and a massive shower
 The breakfast was very good, the hotel manager visited every table and was again very friendly.
We genuinely could not find fault with the hotel or its excellent staff
We shall definitely be booking in for a longer stay next summer. ",5,2020,10,11
120,A great staycation night in London,"I had visited the hotel earlier in year for brunch with friends and was impressed at that time therefore decided to choose this hotel for a celebratory night away with my Mrs.

Hotel is in a great location near Tate Modern and also has good access to the river and Borough Market.

I felt very COVID secure with staff ensuring proper social distancing and hygiene perspective.

The room was modern and very luxurious.

Excellent value for money!",5,2020,10,11
120,Very good,"I had an excellent time at the Hilton.  I stayed in an executive suit which was very spacious and extremely clean.  The wifi was excellent and I was also amazed at how quiet it was in the room - you couldn't hear a thing which is just how I like it.  Also, some people have suggested that the decor is a bit dark but I personally liked the decor.  

Breakfast was also a delight.  They have the usual cereals, yoghurts, pastries, muffins etc and they also do a hot full-English breakfast as well including sausages (vegetarian ones too), toast, potatoes, mushrooms, eggs and baked beans.  Because of covid-19 you have to order your hot items at the kitchen (like a canteen) but it takes them only a matter of minutes to make your plate for you.  And they definitely don't cheap out on the portions!  My hot plate was full to the brim.  

Overall, I would definitely stay in this room again.  Also, and in case this is important for anyone, I felt as though they adhered to Covid-19 safety practices really well.  All staff members wore masks and there was hand gel everywhere.  

There were some cons though: I found the day staff at reception to be slightly frosty although the night staff were really nice.  I also asked to check in early and was told that this couldn't be guaranteed.  However, when I got to the hotel, they informed me that they were able to check me in early after all.  I wish they would have called/emailed me to tell me that as I would have come to the hotel earlier!! Lastly, I called reception from the room on three occasions during my stay and no one answered.  In the end, I had to call the cleaning department and ask them to pass a message on to the reception team.",5,2020,10,10
120,Great hotel again - during Covid,"We’ve stayed here before and had a superb experience then and just as good, albeit in different circumstances this time.

Due to C19 restrictions, the little touches like having duvet turned back and slippers laid out can’t happen.

But, the rooms are luxurious in an understated way, extremely comfortable beds. We didn’t have time to use the pool this time, but it really is a great Spa! 

The hotel were accommodating with allowing an early 0900 check-in and responded quickly via the message function of the Hilton Honours app. Complimentary glass of Prosecco was well-received as was the service in the bar. They’re still operating a buffet breakfast (delicious with loads of choice) but everything is in portions covered with cling film over them- making it no different to going to a coffee shop. Loads of hand sanitiser around and the constant cleaning of touch points. 

Highly recommended! ",5,2020,09,28
120,Wonderful break ,"From the moment we arrived to the time we left, this was truly a great and wonderful three night stay at a great hotel with amazing staff 
The team thoroughly deserve a pat on the back
We were upgraded to a suite being diamond members which was well designed and decorated 
We are at the restaurant twice, for lunch and an evening meal and the food was very good
The breakfast was amazing, this through Covid
Each day for breakfast there was a different procedure due to current restraints and every time the food was perfect and the staff were amazing in their delivery
The bar team delivered great drinks including cocktails, bourbon and various gin
They also very kindly offered two glasses of champagne for our celebration, which was a very nice touch
Great well stocked minibar of soft drinks in the suite rooms
This hotel is on the south side of the river and very close to some great bars and restaurants in borough market
Well positioned near the wobbly bridge and Tate Modern 
Great pool as well which was also well run with Covid on the agenda
We will definitely be back soon
My personal thanks to Anthony Watson for his kind help prior and throughout our stay
Well done the GM and his team
Go visit this hotel and enjoy J

120,Recommended!,"I've stayed here previously as it is one of my preferred hotels in this part of London. This latest stay was for three nights on business.

The hotel is well located, near Southwark Station, the Tate Modern, Borough Market and St Paul's Cathedral and the city. There are also a plethora of decent pubs, bars and restaurants within walking distance.

On check in, despite being a HH Diamond member, no upgrade was offered. The executive lounge, (which is very good when open, by the way) was closed due to COVID but I was given a drinks voucher for two drinks from the bar for each night of my stay, together with a snack box.

All of the public areas such as the lobby, bar and restaurant are modern and contemporary, which gives a feel of quite an upscale hotel. My Deluxe King room was a good size and nicely furnished. The bed was huge and very comfortable, with the usual, awesome Hilton pillows! The bathroom had a large walk in shower. The room and bathroom were spotless and can be cleaned daily on request.

The gym is small and the amount of equipment has been reduced to allow more social distancing, but there was enough there for a basic workout. The indoor pool and jacuzzi is a very nice area. Both the gym and the pool are limited to a handful of guests at a time and time slots have to be booked.

Breakfast in the restaurant has been reduced and there is no hot buffet. Instead, all hot food is made to order, which isn't a problem unless you are short on time. The tables are well spaced due to COVID. Equally, the tables in the bar are spaced well, so it all feels pretty safe. All staff were very polite and offered great service. All were wearing face masks 24/7, which was reassuring.

Overall, a really good hotel, which I would definitely recommend.

",5,2020,09,24
120,Superb Hotel,My husband and I stayed for two nights. First thing we noticed was how welcoming the staff were and how Covid safe they had made the premises. Rooms were spotless and the restaurant and bar areas also impressed. Would definitely recommend. ,5,2020,09,20
120,As good as ever ,It’s always a treat to come here so I was a little nervous about how it might have changed post lockdown. I needn’t have worried:  whilst appropriate safeguards were in place they weren’t intrusive and the staff were as charming and helpful as ever. ,5,2020,09,20
120,Luxury stay,"I booked this hotel as part of my partners birthday surprise to London. Upon arriving at the hotel the staff are absolutely superb and you get that 5 star feel straight away. We even managed to bag an upgrade without even asking due to the nature of our stay.

Upon going to our room on the third floor we were really satisfied with it. Very spacious living quarters, well lit, comfortable bed with bedside tables and charging points, bathroom was superb too! 

My only negative criticisms would be the room had a through way door to the next room which really compromised on soundproofing and even though the guests next door were quiet, we felt as if they were in our room when they opened or closed doors. The lighting was a bit odd as you couldn’t just have certain lights on, it was either all of them or nothing. 

Apart from that our stay was superb and we’d come back again should we have a cheeky getaway to London any time soon! 

Thank for the hospitality.
Jordan & Megan",4,2020,09,19
120,Excellent hotel,"We visited as a couple celebrating our wedding anniversary and were not disappointed. Atmosphere is relaxed but the hotel feels covid safe. Hand sanitiser everywhere in reception, temperature check on arrival and masked areas and staff. 
On arrival we were kindly offered a glass of Prosecco. We were afforded an upgrade and check in was actually enjoyable with lovely and friendly staff. 
Room was absolutely spotless, bed was very comfortable and extras were great. 
We had breakfast - again no issues with covid with a one way system and food wrapped or served to the individual. Great meal with plenty of choice, cooked food fresh and hot. Restaurant area was really relaxed with interesting and well thought out decor. 
The hotel was quiet, calm, enjoyable and in a great location. We will definitely recommended and come back! ",5,2020,09,15
120,Delightful,"Just had a two night stay at Hilton Bankside and extremely pleased with the entire experience. With Covid  restrictions in place, not the usual amenities and service but what was on offer was very adequate. Hilton Bankside is a  oasis in the area, very quiet and relaxing after a day out sightseeing, walking or touring London.
The staff were all friendly, helpful and concerned for our wellbeing.  Rooms spotlessly clean with extra precautions taken at this time. Breakfast was wonderful with all the choices usually associated with Hilton but served differently. Hot or cold, cereals, fruit juices, cooked or just plain continental all readily available. To my delight, even vegetarian sausages! 
Constant cleaning throughout the public areas so a feeling of safety and security was gratifying.
Hilton Bankside is close to the Tate and across the bridge to St Paul's if you want the City so very central to all that London has to offer.
As for the bed, so wonderfully comfortable and a great nights night's sleep at the end of a busy day.
Will definitely be returning in the future without a doubt. Thank you for a very enjoyable stay.",5,2020,09,15
120,Great Hotel,"This is my favourite hotel in London. Near the Tate Modern and South Bank attractions. Rooms are spacious and modern, breakfast (even in Covid times) is excellent and the staff are always helpful. The bar is comfortable and the food is good. When open, the exec lounge is impressive.",5,2020,09,15
120,"Amazing hotel, amazing service!","I recently stayed at the Hilton London Bankside with my fiance and what a beautiful hotel! 

On arrival, we were greeted by extremely friendly and helpful reception team members. Our temperature was taken and were offered a glass of prosseco and a bag of candies. So sweet.

Our room was huge, very modern and spotless.

Room service was fanastic.

Parking very close by. 

I just cannot fault this hotel. 

My fiance and I are due to get married in Chelsea next month after our wedding in Barbados was cancelled and will stay at this hotel during our festivities!",5,2020,09,13
120,Wonderful hotel,"A perfect stay in what is now one of our favourite Hiltons. Everything about the hotel is well done. Breakfast arrangements, working with the current restrictions, were excellent. The area is lively without being noisy with many restaurants and pubs within a few minutes walk. Staff were unfailingly friendly, helpful and welcoming. Thank you to everyone. ",5,2020,09,13
120,Continues To Be Excellent,"Stayed here in a post Covid world on 31st August - check in was exceptional, with a glass or Prosecco on arrival, and an upgrade because of my Hilton Status - fantastic. 

The hotel is as spotless as it always has been, and breakfast, whilst not self serve for hot dishes (a chef does this for you) is just as it was before - exceptional. 

The swimming pool is now bookable in 45 minute slots, rather than just turning up - a Covid victim I guess.

Exec room was, as always spotless. The exec lounge is closed but they do give you drinks vouchers and a small bento snack box to make up for that - this was lovely too.

Location is walking distance to everything you need. The parking isn't available anymore so I used an app called your parking space and parked round the corner. 

I'd also like to call out David on front desk for EXCEPTIONAL service - upgrades, late check outs, looking after our bags, pool bookings - NOTHING was too much trouble for this guy and I really hope he's recognised - I was so impressed I wrote to Hilton UK to give the guy a mention.

This Hilton in my mind sets the standards for Hilton worldwide",5,2020,09,07
120,Beautiful Bankside stay,"I chose the Hilton following a really positive stay during Covid at the Hilton Malta in July.

I (normally) visit London fairly frequently to meet with friends after living there for 7 years. However, this year things have been very different. It was important to me to choose a hotel that would be of a high standard, in terms of comfort, location and in these times, Covid-safe measures. My stay here definitely ticked those boxes, with ease.

The hotel has an excellent location, within a few minutes walk of Southwark station (Jubilee Line) and within 15 minutes of Blackfriars, London Bridge and Waterloo. Much of London is actually walkable without the use of public transport from this hotel (managed to walk all the way to Kensington!). 

The hotel has a number of health measures  in place with regards to Covid-19. On arrival, a temperature check, masks to be worn in public spaces in line with government guidance and social distancing clearly marked - including in elevators. Rooms are marked with “Clean Stay” stickers before entering for the first time. Housekeeping will be done on request.

The design of the reception area and rooms is in fitting with the local area with an urban chic vibe, which works very well.

Rooms are spacious and very comfortable. Bathroom was very modern and shower was excellent.

Breakfast was still a buffet, but not all is self serve. All hot food is served by chefs behind screens. This makes sense in the current climate and works well. Food was of a very good standard and is well worth including breakfast in your stay.

I’d definitely recommend the Hilton London Bankside to anyone visiting London, be it for business or leisure.",5,2020,09,06
120,It's a good hotel,"Raul the manager has is eyes full on everything,
The reception staff are excellent, friendly and helpful, 
The room we stayed in had a walk in shower which was sooo nice,
The Bathrobes are AmaZing,
Our room was large so we weren't turning sideways to get round things, 
The bed was very comfortable, 
Loads of power sockets, good WiFi, 
Bottled water provided in room, 
The hotel has focused on  art hung  around the hotel
Location is perfect for the south Bank, and Borough Market etc. 
Definately will stay again",5,2020,09,03
120,Bankside Bliss,"Perfect stay, cannot fault anything, the staff are super friendly and Raul was the perfect Manager, seeing to all hotel guest's needs.  We stayed in a deluxe guest room 233, overlooking the beautiful architecture of the area.  Highly recommend, lots to see and do in the area and lots of small restaurants near. Borough, it is not an over touristy area and we prefer that.  We look forward to our next stay",5,2020,09,03
120,Affordable stay under unusual circumstances,"The Hilton London Bankside is located in London's Southwark neighbourhood whose architecture mix of historical brick and modern glass and steel add to its urban charm. Even though Waterloo Station, London Bridge, the Shard, Borough market, Tate Modern, Globe Theatre, the River Thames, Millennium Bridge, Saint Paul's Cathedral and the City of London can easily be reached on foot, the location may not be the most convenient for leisure travellers. This is especially true due to the Southwark tube station closure in the evening and on weekends, which was linked to the early stage past the Covid-19 lockdown.

The welcome at the hotel was friendly, which is generally true for the service and staff members, who swiftly and effectively reacted to requests of any kind. Nevertheles, despite a Hilton Gold Membership we did not get a generous upgrade. Still our room's size was very decent, especially considering London's usually limited hotel room size standard. Also, our room rate had been very affordable at a time the London's hospitality industry seems to suffer from the absence of tourists and business travellers.

Unfortunately, the matress felt already very used, the general cleanliness of the room left room for considerable improvement and the shower left the bathroom flooded if not closely observed. After some days, a very unpleasant smell from the shower's gutter forced us to move to another room because no cleaning took place after our complaint. The new room was OK, but despite the information we placed at the front desk, the broken safe was not repaired.

The breakfast was fine with a good selection  of high-quality cold cuts, freshly made eggs, sausages and pancakes. Nonetheless, the bread was a disaster.

In general, we were happy with the price for value ratio and the staff's friendliness, but see quite a path to meet perfection.",4,2020,09,02
120,Hilton - you've done it again!  Amazing!,"Our family of 5 (in 3 rooms) have just enjoyed a 2 night stay at this hotel and we loved it.  As regular Hilton visitors we were utterly impressed with this hotel and it is now our favourite London hotel by far.  The staff were amazing throughout and we were particularly impressed with the covid-19 checking and cleanliness measures.  As other reviewers have said it is so close to the Tate Modern but is also close to other attractions and the walks to the London Eye, St Paul's, Borough Market are great.   We appreciated the drinks vouchers in place of access to the Executive Lounge but the Bento box offered was really poor - Hilton you can do better than that!   Finally, we thought breakfast was superb and well managed and a credit to you that you have it in full operation (when other Hilton's in London are offering you breakfast in a box in your room - why????)",5,2020,09,01
120,Beginning of lockdown UK,"I write this a little late as the madness that ensued our visit took precedence, obviously.
We arrived on the 20th March, travelling from the Middle East into the UK just as lockdown began ( that night actually, all bars, restaurants were closed).
I would like to thank the management and staff of The Hilton Bankside for their fantastic response to this pretty traumatic event for all.
Their courtesy, common sense, humility and humanity moved me deeply. They cared for us, made in the spot, sensible decisions in what was unknown territory.
I will not forget this anytime soon and when this is all settled I can assure you that my business is now forever yours when I am in London.

Thank you all and I hope that The Hilton Group have taken care of you as you did to those of us that were fortunate enough to be in your care at a time of need.

Xx",5,2020,08,30
120,Amazing hotel and service,"I stayed here in August for two weeks before heading into France.  Full disclosure - I am a Hilton Diamond member.  I have stayed at plenty of Hilton’s in London, and this hotel has to be the best.  The location is awesome, right next to the Tate Modern on south bank.  It is easy to walk to pretty much anywhere in central London, and I logged around 5-7 miles a day seeing the sights.  

The service here is exemplary.  From the team checking me in and getting me situated, to Raul (the hotel manager) making sure everything was ok and taken care of.  He and his team are among the best I have seen in the world.  And I stay in hotels 125 days a year.

The hotel had great Covid precautions in place, and only 3-4 people could work out in the gym at one time.  The pool is open as well, so that is a nice benefit during these uncertain times.

If you’re in London, definitely give the Hilton Bankside a stay.  You will be glad you did!",5,2020,08,29
120,Excellent ,"Stayed with my family including a 5 and 8 year old who are well behaved. 
Very welcoming staff, very friendly. Offered the children a bag of sweets on arrival (they did ask me first if that was ok). 
Very clean rooms, which were above our expectations. 
We were fortunate enough to use the pool which was fabulous. 
Good location, easy enough to find parking. It’s literally behind the Tate Modern so easy access to the river. 
All round fab stay-cat! ",5,2020,08,29
120,A warm welcome - genuine hospitality,"We stayed for one night at the end of August - I chose the hotel because of the pool and I was not disappointed. We felt very welcome from the moment we arrived - and for the 24 hours we were in the hotel we were well looked after and felt very safe. Although quiet - we did not feel out of place - there were enough people in the bar and restaurant to create some atmosphere. Staff were lovely - helpful and chatty. Pool was the highlight - I swam twice. Strange times, but the Hilton has risen to the occasion. Top tip - there is table tennis to play outside!",5,2020,08,27
120,Lettuce sandwiches on white bread? Curious!,"As a Hilton Diamond member thought I'd be brave and try a hotel stay for the first time this year. I have stayed here in the past and been bowled over by the quality of the lounge and service.  The room this time was clean enough.  Good Diamond upgrade (but missing a coffee machine). The lounge was closed (possibly COVID related, possibly cost-cutting).  Offered 2 drinks vouchers in the bar plus a mystery snack.

The Diamond paperwork promised the snack would be a canape (singular) in the lounge. Given instead a Bento box.  Bento box very pretty but not suitable to sterilise thoroughly.  Bento box contained 2 salad tomatoes, 1 carrot fragment, 1 slice of raw red pepper, 1 slice of cheese, spoonful of houmous and a handful of pretzels and 2 crackers.  Also 1 sad clingfilm wrapped ham & cheese sandwich.  I don't eat ham so asked for a vegetarian substitute.  I received (accurately described by the waiter) a small sandwich  of lettuce in white bread!  The Hilton Bankside used to have wonderful food. I guess the chefs all left when lockdown started?",3,2020,08,24
120,Friendly & clean,We highly enjoyed our stay at the Hilton London Bankside. Staff was friendly and helpful across the board (e.g. Thomas from the front desk). Room and facilities were clean and in good shape. Well done - we will come back! ,5,2020,08,24
120,Short Family Break,"We stayed here last week as a large family group as a last minute short break. The hotel was spotless and very modern with staff dealing with the COVID situation remarkably well whilst still maintaining an elegant, classy atmosphere in this beautiful hotel. Breakfast service was superb with the Manager being very welcoming.  Happy Hour between 5-6pm was also very well received.  Lots of places in vicinity, namely The White Hart for a drink, The Refinery restaurant and many supermarkets down the street. Well done and we will be back!",5,2020,08,24
120,Great hotel,"We stayed here for my sons birthday as it was close to the aquarium etc.... we had a one bedroom suite... which was huge for the price and in London! Very clean and well presented - the only downside was the lights - you either had to have them all on or all off.... no side lamps on.. which is odd! 
We had tea and a coffee machine with biscuits, the toiletries were nice - however no where to dry towels... or swimwear after we had a swim! 

The pool was a good size but very loud... sorry to the couple who were trying to enjoy a swim with our noisy children! 

The breakfast was great - a Buffet style but socially distanced and a great variety! 

We received free drinks and nibble boxes early evening as part of our honours club! 

All in all a great hotel - would stay again for sure!! ",5,2020,08,20
120,Amazing - If I could give a higher rating I would,"Myself and my partner stayed here a couple of days ago and it was amazing. 
My partner booked this as a surprise and it didn’t disappoint. From the moment I walked in the doors I felt so safe and relaxed. Covid 19 protocols in place are  extremely reassuring, everywhere was spotlessly clean and all staff we came into contact with were so welcoming and helpful.
We ate in both the restaurant for breakfast and the bar for an evening meal. Breakfast was a delight. So well laid out, staff were extremely attentive and the breakfast itself was delicious. Our food in the bar was also very good and again staff really provided outstanding service. 
Our room itself was on level 6 and it was spotless. All public corridors and lifts were also extremely clean at all times. 
We used the leisure facilities and for us it were the highlight of our stay. You book your 45minute time slot and you have the leisure facilities entirely to yourself, amazing! 
I cannot recommend this hotel enough. Thank you for a wonderful stay 💕
",5,2020,08,19
120,3 Nights ..,"Checked in today. Unfortunately Lounge is closed, but we got drinks voucher and a glass of fizz when we checked in. Very much miss the Concierge, Valet Parking and assistance with Luggage. There is parking just along the road at £30 a night. But that’s all understandable during this time. As always the hotel is spotless and smells nice. This is now the best Hilton in the U.K. by a long way. Park Lane, Glasgow and Trafalgar are just a patch on their former selves .. Bankside Hilton should provide U.K. Hilton Training to show the others.",5,2020,08,14
120,Never Hilton again.,"Found my stay at Hilton bankside somewhat unpleasent . 
This hotel would rate better in my book I Think as a mediocre 4-Star hotel. 
On weekends the bar and lobby area is transformed into a Big private event and one can hardly enter for drunk people. I find it undesirable to ‘live’ in the middle of someone else’s private bash, and prefer a quiet hotel. 
Rooms didnt smell fresh, although they did try their Best and provided an air purifier. Beds were not very comfy.",2,2020,08,04
120,Faultless,"Superb customer service from the moment we arrived. Carried out all of the Covid checks in a polite and professional manner. Offered us a glass of prosecco on arrival which was a nice touch. Room was clean, spacious and comfortable. Breakfast was spot on as well. Even extended an already generous checkout time by a few hours. Thank you for making our stay special in these difficult times.",5,2020,08,02
120,Superb - Perfect example of how to adapt,"Having had a recent stay that did not go well at a hotel near to this one (Marriott) I was concerned how this could go, but Hilton Bankside demonstrated hot hotels can adapt so well to the current situation.

They were in touch prior to arrival to advise what they could offer and how things had changed.  The arrival was great quick temperature scan, glass of sparkling wine and off to the room, which was a very nice upgrade.

As a Hilton Diamond member I would normally have lounge access, but currently the lounge is closed. You get vouchers for drinks and a complimentary snack box at the bar in the evening, a very nice touch.

Breakfast was excellent, you select your table and it is then set, they have a selection of sealed items in the fridges and coffee/tea available.  You then go to the counter and order what you wish from the chef.  All the major options you can think of were available.  Better than a buffet any day of the week!!

The main thing however was just how inviting and helpful all the staff were while at the same time maintaining excellent standards of cleanliness and distance.  

Despite these difficult times the hotel has a helpful and welcoming attitude, with a huge thanks to Cristina who is doing an amazing job!

Can't wait to return later in the month!",5,2020,07,22
120,First visit but a really pleasurable one ,"Stayed here for one night on business. Offered a glass of Prosecco on arrival following the temperature check and hand washing station. Lovely upgrade to an executive room and lounge closed (expectedly) but a voucher for 2 drinks and a bento box of snacks and food- well thought out. Room clean and lovely facilities and a range of teas. Breakfast quiet (expected) self service for some things and hot food served and made to order. Poached eggs cooked to perfection, nothing too much trouble for the waiter or breakfast chef and ingredients really good quality. Well done to staff in unusual new circumstances but same old Hilton warmth hospitality and service shone through - actually relaxing in this odd time. Well done to the team!!",5,2020,07,15
120,Great Visit!!!,"Stayed here for 5 nights.  From start to finish, it was a great visit.  Nice and easy checkin.  We had a nice spacious room in a quiet location on the top floor.  Executive Lounge was great.  Very nice and comfortable to sit and relax there.  Both food and drink were great.  The buffet breakfast in the restaurant was also superb.  The hotel is in a great location.  Short walk to the Southwark underground station, about a 10 minute walk to Borough Market and Tate Modern is just one block from the hotel.  There is a great pub right down the block from the hotel called the White Hart Pub.  Also, a special thanks to Adeshola who is a Concierge Team Member who was incredibly helpful.  ",5,2020,03,16
120,Impressive Value for an Excellent Property,"This is a beautiful hotel in Bankside. I booked because of the central location and the price, but was pleasantly surprised that it was a 5* hotel. Loved the fox motif tied to the construction of the hotel.

Check-in was a breeze. We arrived at noon and were thankful for a room immediately after a long journey. Bell staff took our bags immediately and delivered to our room promptly. Desk staff asked about our plans and were willing to offer suggestions if needed.

The room itself was beautiful. Modern with dark wood and nice lighting. Very comfortable bed and wonderful rainfall shower. Comfortable robes, with turndown service.

Location was great for us, 7 min walk to the Underground and a 10 min walk to Borough Market. Convenient grocery stores located downstairs.

Highly recommend, a great property at an even better price.",5,2020,03,16

Starting from the warm check in with the friendly and professional Melania who answered every question i made with a smile and good knowledge. Customer service excellent my compliments to Stefanie witch she delivers it in the best manner. 
Hotel rooms were clean and cozy, bar and lounge area was amazing and with good atmosphere, same as the breakfast great delicious food and staff as well helpful 10/10.

120,Great Hotel with excellent standards,"Great hotel with excellent standards, all staff we encountered were friendly and polite, that included check in, the  distillery bar and the executive lounge. The hotel is modern and clean and just a stones throw away from the Tate Modern and a short walk to the vibrant Borough Market . We stayed in one of the executive rooms which gave us access to the executive lounge which is one of the best lounges we have used , great area with very good food and very efficient and friendly staff.

120,Almost Brilliant all Round!,"WE stayed here for a week to see London as its close to the river and has lots of things to see nearby.
You can walk to so many attractions from the hotel for example The Shard, Tower Bridge, Millennium Bridge, ST Pauls, The Globe etc. The underground is also very near and easy to get to.
The hotel is modern and classy with a good restaurant and popular bar. There are usually specials on most days too.
The staff are wonderful at the hotel. Melania on the front desk was amazing and helped us so much!
We checked in earlier and because we had an executive room with lounge entrance included, we could use the lounge area as soon as we arrived. This made us feel relaxed and at home. The food was extremely good as well as the service. The lounge staff are super, especially the breakfast staff!
The rooms are very spacious with nice bathrooms and modern fittings including good blackout curtains and a desk area. The beds are very comfy which we usually find at a HIlton.
The only small complaint we have is about the spa and gym area. The gym is well equipped, although quite small and the spa area only consists of a couple of treatment rooms, and you have to book and pay in advance. It would be good if they had  proper spa area with steam and sauna rooms. My first massage was not good, however my second one was really good. I had to different ladies treating me.
We look forward to staying here again when in London. WE highly recommend it.",5,2020,03,02
120,Hilton Bankside,"Best Hilton I have ever stayed in.  That says a lot as I have Diamond status.
Every member of staff I met, from check in, to Sorin in the leisure centre, Anna at the bar and James the general manager went above and beyond to be friendly, professional and courteous.
You have a fantastic product- be proud.
This is now my go to Hilton for London.",5,2020,02,28
120,Super clean modern hotel in a great location.,"We were really surprised at how good this hotel was for the price. Stayed in a King suite with access to the lounge. Room was a good size, bathroom nicely appointed. Spotlessly clean .Everything is modern and thr staff are really friendly. Bed was super comfy and the breakfast was excellent. Very close to the Tate and couple of restaurants nearby. Would definitely return.",5,2020,02,26
120,Excellent Hotel,"Excellent property. Only negative was my room window was facing a wall, but I didn’t spend much time in the room. Room and bathroom are spacious. I had a billing issue which was quickly resolved and they sent up a bottle of wine because of my inconvenience. It’s worth getting the breakfast included with your visit. Thank you Anthony Samms for your professionalism. I highly recommend this place.",5,2020,02,24
120,Great Option for Central London Stay,"Not all Hilton's are really good or even decent these days, but the Bankside is excellent.  Proper doorman and bell services upon arrival, inviting lobby, and warm and welcoming check-in service.  The basic room was spacious (particularity by London standards), modern in design with no signs of wear, proper amenities and a very well designed (and even more spacious) bathroom.  Management provided small extras and ensured all of our needs were met.  We found the location to be a good ""middle"" choice from a tourist perspective.  Not in the middle of an overly loud and crowded area, but also not removed for tube lines and good food and drink. After a week, we had nothing to complain about and much to praise.  This is now my new preferred hotel when visiting London.",5,2020,02,23
120,5 pounds for using a fork,"stayed here for 3 nights like couple of weeks back. this time staying here for 12 night at around 270 pounds per night. sure, facilities are as they say. nothing out of the ordinary if one's rating is 5 star but here's something.
i called reception requesting one fork be sent up to my room. i wasn't buying fork from hotel. just using since they had spoons in my room already but no fork. i was told to use a fork it'll cost me 5 pounds. i'd say penny wise pound foolish since obviously i'm a return customer, obviously my stay is longer and certainly there are chances i'd be back (if i so choose to)
been a traveler a long time and traveled all over the world and always had the pleasure of staying at nice hotels. First time a hotel, 5 star at that, asked me that they charge for the luxury of using 1 fork. for one night i'm paying around 270 pounds and i was told we can't loan you 1 fork unless you pay us 5 pounds :D",3,2020,02,19
120,Excellent hotel in a great location,"We stayed here for 3 nights and found everything about this hotel first class. The staff are attentive and friendly, the room was modern and spacious, and the hotel facilities were excellent. It is only a five minute walk from Southwark tube station which made it very easy to get around London, and is just a stones throw from the Tate Modern.

We had a super king size bed which was extremely comfortable (if a little squeaky). The bathroom is large and of a high standard with an excellent shower and complimentary toiletries. It even has a speaker if you want to hear the TV in the bathroom. You are provided with robes and slippers which we used in the hotel's indoor pool, which was heated to a nice temperature, complete with an area that had water jets. They also have turn-down service in the evenings which was nice to come back to after a long day. There is a safe and adequate wardrobe space is provided. Breakfast was expensive (~£25) so we didn't bother. Instead there is a costa coffee and pret just around the corner. There are also 2 supermarkets just outside the hotel.

We did use the hotel bar once which has a lovely ambience and a range of different drinks.

Overall a top stay and wouldn't hesitate to stay here again when we return to London.",5,2020,02,17
120,Impressive hotel amenities ,"Stayed here for 4 nights and I absolutely have no complains except for the minor hiccup where the room we were first assigned, had a loud noise when we switched on the water tap. We had room switched immediately after we provided the feedback. 

Other than that, the hotel provided us baby crib and baby necessities such as shampoo, doll, blanket. The king sized room was spacious and cleaned. We did enjoyed our stay here.

I would say, the only thing is the subway is about 10 minutes walk from the hotel. ",5,2020,02,16
120,One of the best Hilton’s I have used.,"I have focused on using Hilton properties exclusively over the last 2 years and this has been the best hotels in my experience. The attention from the staff is without question superb. Whether it was the ladies who came to the room, the attendants in the restaurant, or the person greeting you at the door, everyone made you feel special. The rooms were large, clean and comfortable. I cannot complain about anything. ",5,2020,02,15
120,Great hotel ,This was my second stay and cannot fault the staff or the facilities. The hotel is in an excellent location very close to the Tate. We chose as we were visiting the Shard. Great breakfast with so much choice. Really friendly staff and great service. Rooms are spacious and the walk in showers are amazing! ,5,2020,02,09
120,Forthcoming Experience,"Friendly and detailed support, especially for general questions, like tourist spots. Concierge, Mr Zalan, took careful care of our needs. Appreciate also that receptionist found a solution for us to extend our stay another 3 days in the same room (same category), which saved us a lot of hassle. The Gym and swimming pool are superb, and feels very private (not crowded). The breakfast in the OXBO restaurant (part of the hotel) is just sublime, and the service personnel there are very friendly and helpful. It is also nice to have simple conversations with hotel employees. Overall, a wonderful experience, thank you.",5,2020,02,08
120,Nice Start to a Trip,"Decided last minute to use Hilton points for this property and am I glad I did. As a Diamond I was given Amazing Front Desk Service, a Nice Executive Lounge with good breakfast, afternoon tea and some evening drinks and food. The Breakfast in the restaurant was as good as it gets.  Nice variety of hot and cold items. Nice upgraded room with a Bathroom that had 2nd Best shower behind Hilton Tokyo. Definitely would stay here again",5,2020,02,04
120,Very good modern Hilton though lackluster service in restaurant and bar,"Had a very good 4-night stay here. After arriving at Paddington Station via the Heathrow Express it was a 17 pounds cab ride to the hotel. This is definitely one of the more modern and chic Hiltons in London. As a Hilton Gold I was upgraded to a King Deluxe room which was more than enough for 2 of us and our 4 suitcases. Room was modern as evidenced by the abundant number of USB charging sockets and the daily complimentary water and soft drinks were welcome. 

Location-wise it is not the most convenient for getting around London given that it was a 6 minute walk to the nearest Tube station but it is situated next to the Tate Modern and we enjoyed walking around the bankside area. Staff-wise the front desk and bell staff were great, always welcoming and helpful.

The hotel loses a star mainly because of the breakfast and bar. While it had a decent range of food and I really enjoyed the various made-to-order items I was very surprised that a breakfast called the ""Full English"" (25 pounds) does not have baked beans. Staff were also very lax in clearing our table even as the empty glasses and plates were accumulating on our table. We had the same lax service when we had an afternoon drink at the bar where we did not get any service and eventually had to walk directly to the bar to make our order. 

And finally, while I am sure the hotel has good intentions, I was disconcerted by receiving a welcome letter in simplified Chinese upon entering the room. Presumably,   the hotel was being helpful as I am from Hong Kong according to their records, but we use traditional Chinese in Hong Kong. I am not sure whether visitors to the hotel from other nations get the ""native language"" treatment, but at least do it properly.

In any case, despite the minor quibbles we enjoyed our stay in the hotel.",4,2020,02,02
120,Excellent health club,"I visit the health club regularly as I am a member and live in London -  I am not writing as a hotel guest with a room. I was delighted to find this club, as its membership rates are excellent value for money considering the very high standard of the facilities. The changing area is always spotlessly clean, the air fresh and the staff are very friendly and helpful. Lots of nice touches, like lovely soft white towels for every visit, good quality liquid soap and body wash, good sized lockers and an effective swimming costume dryer. The gym has fresh filtered water and fresh fruit available too that's refreshing after a swim. The pool is a good length for a hotel pool and just the right temperature, not too warm so more like getting into a bath and not too cold so you can't stay in for very long. It's welcome too that the pool's filtration system does not use harsh chemicals that dry your skin. The shower cubicles are particularly well designed and well equipped - separate rooms with a lockable door where you can take a decent shower in privacy. Everything is very well maintained. Perhaps it's busy at times, but whenever I go during the day the pool and gym area is quiet and relaxed, with a mixture of hotel guests and external members like me, who all behave very respectfully to one another. I don't use the gym, so can't comment on the equipment, but I hope to start exercising on the rowing machine soon - my New Year resolution!",5,2020,01,27
120,I would stay here again.,"Location is great. Area has lots of restaurants and pubs, plus wonderful shopping. Walk to Borough Market, The Tate Modern, The Globe and also several different tube stops. Navigating London from this hotel could not be easier.

Hilton Honors program is strong here! Executive Lounge has great food, and wonderful service. You could make a meal out of the happy hour buffet, which is ideal if you are catching a play at the Globe, or a show in West End, and are looking for something light, pre-show. Also, the drinks are free. Best of all, they literally come to your table and offer you dessert, which they bring to you with a smile. Everyone here was so friendly and customer focused. 

During our stay, we walked past at least 4 other Hiltons, and every time we commented on how glad we were to have chosen the Bankside. You really cannot beat the location, the staff and the amenities. ",5,2020,01,27
120,Short Break,Family of four. Had a lovely time at this hotel. Very modern and bright decor. Reception team all very friendly and welcoming. Room spotlessly clean and good facilities. Comfy bed and pillows. Breakfast excellent and had a meal in the restaurant which was lovely. All staff encountered very friendly. Hope to return soon.,5,2020,01,26
120,(Another) Birthday Weekend visit,"This is my 4th or 5th time at this hotel. The hotel itself is well placed you like being just outside the busy streets of central London, whilst being just an easy 15 or so minutes walk into town.
Whilst this is my preferred London hotel, what is always a disappointment is the breakfast. As a vegetarian who also doesnt eat eggs, theres not a lot to choose from, especially in terms of hot food.  Rather than having the usual hash browns, Bankside opts to have fried potato cubes which are always, always undercooked and hard.
If I did eat eggs then the omelette station looks good, but it's not an option for me, so it's really just grilled tomatoes that are hot that I can eat.
What's more of a shock is that the hotel has a dedicated 'vegan' bedroom, so why not up the game at breakfast to cater for vegans and vegetarians???",4,2020,01,26
120,Niece’s birthday ,"Thank you to all the staff involved for making my niece’s birthday stay so enjoyable, including the unexpected birthday cake! She was really pleased, her friends were impressed and I am a very grateful auntie. ",5,2020,01,25
120,Perfect for weekend break,"Stayed here on a recent weekend trip and cannot rate the hotel high enough. Only booked last minute after switching from another hotel and so glad we did! Very friendly staff at all times, very tasty breakfast, room was very spacious and the bed was so comfortable!! Within 5 minutes of Southwark tube station and 10 minutes of Blackfriars too. Will definitely book again",5,2020,01,23
120,Very nice hotel for business,"Very nice hotel for business and vacation stays if you need to be in the London Bridge area. Hotel is very nice, staff is excellent and they have a nice gym and pool as well. The area is full of nice restaurants and shops. ",5,2020,01,21
120,Snazzy Choice in Bankside,"Very modern and stylish choice in an incredibly convenient location, just steps behind the Tate Modern.  The area is really interesting, full of unique shops and restaurants (and plenty of chains too of course) and just down the road from Borough Market and the buzz of that high street.

The hotel lobby is comfortable, although a bit small.  The executive lounge was fantastic, one of the best I've seen.  The attached restaurant and bar were quite appealing, and we ate breakfast every day in the hotel and really enjoyed it.

The staff were very accommodating and helpful.  We had to choose a second room as our first looked at a wall, and then we were upgraded on the second night of three total.  The rooms are really well appointed, simple but elegant-modern.  The beds made for a great sleep, and the bathrooms well designed.

I would absolutely stay here again as an option in the Bankside area of London.",5,2020,01,20
120,Exceptional Service,Its not often I write reviews and I stay in a lot of very good hotels. The Hilton and specifically Daniele really went the extra mile on service. I was able to sms anything and the reply came almost instantly to resolve and action. I couldn't ask for more. The room was as you would expect. I would stay here again because of the outstanding service.,5,2020,01,20
120,You can bank on this hotel,We stayed overnight here after a theatre visit. What a great hotel and worthy of their five stars rating. A casual mention that we were celebrating my birthday elicited complementary glasses of Prosecco and on returning to our room a ‘Happy Birthday’ note and beautiful gateaux from Melania and her team at the front desk. Bedroom was super once we had found the wardrobes (!) and the bed very comfortable.,5,2020,01,19
120,All round great stay ,"The location is perfect for tourists and in particular families. Bankside is humming with activity and the hotel sits within a few minutes walk of the area. Southwark underground station is a short walk to/from the hotel (less than 10 minutes). The rooms are modern, of good size and stylish. We had interconnecting rooms which were perfect for two young teenagers to have their own space.  The staff were very helpful and friendly.  We will definitely stay at the Hilton Bankside again.",5,2020,01,15
120,A beautiful hotel with some issues,"The rooms and hotel were comfortable and beautiful. Our included breakfast as Hilton Gold members was fantastic. Unfortunately, we encountered a couple of issues during our stay that detracted from an otherwise great stay.

The first was a plumbing issue in our room. Turning on the hot water caused a racket from the pipes, almost like a ship's horn. It made using the hot water in the evening difficult after one of us had gone to sleep. To their credit, they seemed to have fixed it by the end of our stay, but it was very bothersome the first couple of evenings.

The second was poor service at Oxbo during breakfast. On one of the mornings, there were about 4 or 5 staff members standing and talking amongst themselves instead of attending to guests. While they mingled, we had to stack multiple plates on our table as no one bothered to come clear them. We had to flag someone down in order to get water and utensils. We noticed a couple at a table next to us looking around, hoping to get a server's attention, to no avail. It was a very frustrating experience.

That said, the chef who handled orders for eggs/waffles/pancakes was wonderful and very friendly. And as said, the food was great.

Location-wise, there isn't much around the hotel to speak of except the Tate, but the Tube is about a 5-minute walk away, which will quickly whisk you away to all the tourist sites in London.",4,2020,01,15
120,Amazing,Beautiful hotel with a nice design touch. Loved the sea bass at the restaurant.  Exceptional service - staff graciously helped me deal with a plug/ transformer issue even though it was very late. Will definitely stay again!,5,2020,01,13
120,Amazing staff,"My family stayed at this hotel at the start of January.  The welcome from the staff at reception, the bar and in the lobby was so warm and they made our two small children feel really welcome.  Congratulations Hilton Bankside - that’s how you do customer service ! ",5,2020,01,12
120,Best Stay of 2020 So Far...,"This has been my favourite property whenever I stay in central London for the past 3 years. 
To start the New Year, I decided to bring my family here and we enjoyed every bits of our time.
You can’t beat the breakfast here with freshly made waffles & pancakes plus the omelette station (a bit of smile from the chefs would be awesome). 
This is our first time to use the swimming pool and we really enjoyed it. 
The Executive Lounge was the cherry on top as we were taken care very well by the team who worked there. 
We were here to see Olafur Eliasson exhibition at Tate Modern and we use this property as our overnight base. 
Looking forward for our future stay here next month!!! Job well done guys!!!",5,2020,01,11
120,Short Break,"Excellent hotel, location, staff service all round. Room service with breakfast excellent. Room very clean and attention to detail. Would find it difficult to be critical in any way.  From the first contact on arrival to the last on leaving, whilst not maybe the cheapest it’s great value for money. ",5,2020,01,11
120,Exceptional,We stayed here as part of a wedding group and had two interconnecting rooms. They were modern and had all the services you needed including a fridge you could use for your own use! The staff were friendly and food options extensive for breakfast. The price was great value and we got instantly recognised as gold members at checkin.,5,2020,01,11
120,Christmas getaway- brilliant ,"What a great weekend.  The hotel staff were brilliant with Christmas jumpers and complimentary mulled wine at check in. 

Lovely room and the executive lounge is one of the best Hilton do

Such a great location and what a great hotel",5,2020,01,10
120,Visiting Tate Modern,"Hotel, including executive package was Reallohn Great, as always. Roms are very comfortable and cosy.  Breakfast and lunch haf been recommendable as well as the cream tea. 
Situated next the Tate Modern you can make several stops there.",5,2020,01,09
120,Good stay,"Newer hotel and very clean, helpful people. Pricy break fast but good quality. I would return to this hotel next time I come to London again in the future. Location are also near the subway and railway. Lots of places to eat near by.",5,2020,01,08
120,Amazing hospitality!,"I tend to stay at this hotel for business trips, and am always welcomed by the lovely staff. In particular, during my latest trip down to London, I was looked after by Alioune, who made sure things were in place for me throughout my stay. I was met with a friendly smile, and felt at ease at the hotel with staff like Alioune ensuring everything was in place!

Thank you to the staff & Alioune for making my trips down to London the easiest they can be :)",5,2020,01,06
120,Lovely stay in the heart of London!,"My husband and I recently spent the night at The Hilton Bankside and must say it's a real gem of a hotel. Having stayed at numerous Hiltons all over Europe I must say this might be one of the best. Everything was to a very high standard from the moment we set foot in the hotel lobby. The room was large, modern and clean. The staff were all welcoming and helpful. The location is fantastic - right behind the Tate and not far from Borough Market. We will definitely visit again!",5,2020,01,05
120,Excellent as Always,"Bankside never let us down! Stayed for just one night with our children. Executive lounge was lovely, staff is welcoming and friendly. We were offered bowl of penne pasta with tomato sauce and cheese for the children in the lounge for free, so we didn't have to drag them in the restaurant or outside. Kids loved the christmas decoration and they loved searching for hidden foxes everywhere. Buffet is great, could have more healthy options but we still thought it was fab! Swimming pool was great and kids had tons of fun! Rooms are spacious, clean and comfy. Thank you Bankside! ",5,2020,01,05
120,Family London Christmas Vacation,The Hilton Bankside served as a base for my family’s stay in London over the Christmas holiday.    Very close to the Tate Museum & walkable distance to the London Eye area.  Very clean hotel and the room sizes are similar to hotels in larger cities like New York and Paris.    We were able to book one of the family interconnected rooms which worked great for us.     The tube is close but given my family of four it was just as easily $$$ wise to Uber to places we couldn’t walk vs. buying individual tube tickets.    My Hilton status allowed my family to access for their breakfast buffet which was a major plus.    Definitely will stay here again.,5,2020,01,04
120,"Fantastic hotel, flawless service","Had a four night stay here with family members aged 12-70. What a pleasant experience! Friendly and professional staff, spacious rooms and bathrooms, all fairly new (I was told the hotel us 4 years old), excellent restaurant and even the spa was a treat. Will definitely return ",5,2020,01,03
120,All new and clean. Friendly,"Hotel was very nice condition. Location was so easy to approach anywhere. Not too busy area.
Staffs were super friendly.
Room was nice and clean. All new.
We will go back here.We had new tear celebrations at the bar. People were good.",5,2020,01,02
120,Excellent stay,Excellent stay. Stayed in room 610 from 26 to 30 December 2019. Very comfortable bed. Spacious room for London standards. Excellent breakfast. Nice ambience. On of best hotels in London! Will definitely return.,5,2019,12,31
120,"Great hotel, attentive staff and a decent bar","Have stayed here a few times now, and quite like the design of the rooms, which are kept very clean.  The staff are attentive without being intrusive, and there are some fun characters in the Bar and restaurant to make the experience all the more pleasant.",4,2019,12,30
120,Christmas 2019,"Hector excellent attention on the breakfast in the Hilton LONDON bankside.
UK employees too much arrogant in special people on the front desk.
Tanya sent me a lot messages but never answers my suggestion. 
In summary people is very important in all business and of they don’t collaborate you have problems.
Happy new year 2020",4,2019,12,29
120,London stay made great by Panos (Reception Supervisor),"Had an amazing stay on the 8th of December!! Mainly thanks to Panos for going the extra mile, offering an upgrade and a lovely welcone amenity!! Also, offered me one on the lovely fox dolls to give to my niece!! Great stay and lovely hotel!!",5,2019,12,26
120,Christmas 2019 family vacation - London,"Overall we were happy with our stay at Hilton London Bankside.

Pluses
- we had to get a family suite since we were 2 adults and 2 kids...  room had 2 rooms with 2 tv’s, 1 full bath with tub/shower and another shower and 1/2 bath in other room.  We liked the room.
- housekeeping was very good
- concierge surprised our son with dessert and balloons on his birthday
- Christmas stockings left on door
- lounge was nice amenity, but sometimes hard to find seating 
-lobby decorated for holidays which was nice 

Negatives
- purchased movie bundle but movies had to be restarted several times and maintenance had to visit room
-  maintenance came to “check room fridge” unannounced and entered room while my wife was in the other room and he did not apologize for indiscretion.
- oxbo restaurant was not cleaned up for dinner service post lunch 
- distillery bartender not aware of seasonal drinks posted on their Instagram page 

We would stay here again...",4,2019,12,25
120,Stay at the Hilton London Bankside,"Stay here people! It is easy to get accommodation in London wrong. Too expensive, old, too small, too far out or a combination of all of these... This is NOT Hilton London. Great value, great location, helpful staff and a large modern room (with a soft snugly bed). SO happy with my stay",5,2019,12,25
120,Amazing family escape,"Wonderful experience at the Bankside Hilton, and very helpful and friendly staff that really made an effort to make us feel at home. We were really taken care of by all the team during the visit, will be back again! ",5,2019,12,24
120,Second time here,Really love this hotel. Came for a night last year and came for a week stay this year. Staff is really friendly breakfast is a great value. Probably best executive lounge I’ve seen at a Hilton. Great location ,5,2019,12,24
120,Excellent and warm welcome,"Once you've been to the Hilton Bankside not many other hotels will meet the same expectations... We love to stay at the Hilton Bankside. Excellent welcome, excellent service, polite and attentive staff. Well designed and decorations adapted to season. Breakfast is as always a walhalla. So thank you to the Hilton Bankside for giving us a very pleasant stay again and again. Last stay was very special - a 5 star treatment because our room was specially decorated. Highly recommended.",5,2019,12,24
120,"Excellent service, nice pool","Nice rooms, excellent service, nice bar and good bar food. Really enjoyed the leisure pool. Only real criticism slightly mean with shower gel etc.

Good value if you are looking for a base rather than just a room for the night.",5,2019,12,23
120,Pretty Good - Service at breakfast needs improvement,"Hotel is pretty good. Breakfast in the restaurant was good, but the service was not compared to other EU Hiltons. I’m a diamond member and you can order a la carte from the menu as a part of breakfast, which is great. After being shown to our table, most of the time there was no one to get our drink order or a la carte order. We would wait for a few minutes before usually flagging a staff member who seems to be in charge of our section. Only in one morning (out of 5) did someone ask us right away what we would like. Refills for coffee also required having to flag down staff, which makes it feel like you are interrupting them as they clean plates instead of feeling like they are there to help serve you. It was just very different compared to how other EU Hiltons serve and seemed less “proactive” in the customer service. ",4,2019,12,23
120,Hilton at its best,"This is my second stay while traveling through Europe. This is an excellent hotel with great staff. Check in was easy, front desk staff are very friendly and efficient. We stayed in a Jr club level suite that gives you access to breakfast , snacks and drinks through out the day. Rooms are a great size with modern touches. This a great hotel and would recommend.",5,2019,12,21
120,Always enjoy my stay at he Hiton.,I always enjoy my time at the Hilton when I stay there. The staff are friendly and the room service in on point. The rooms are always clean and if I have an issue they try to solve it as soon as possible.,5,2019,12,19
120,"Great: Location, service and fit out ","Location is great: a few minutes from Tate Bankside and the river; a few minutes from the Jubilee line (so Westminster, green park, bond street, canary wharf). A few pubs and borough market not far.

Service was great, people were friendly and tried to help. I’d take the bar over the restaurant anytime though.

Rooms and hotel are new. Lots of plugs, clean, good bathroom/bed. I did have a view of a wall, so don’t expect stunning vistas but do expect a really comfortable modern hotel in a great area with great staff.

I’ve been going to Hiltons for years and for a Long time was a Diamond member but got a bit disenfranchised with the hotels and the brand, so moved on to other brands (lost my status). Honestly hotels like this make me want to come back. Highly recommend it for anyone who wants to visit Tate or be on the Jubilee line.",5,2019,12,16
120,Value for money,"Check in was instant and friendly. Room was immaculate and I got upgraded as a diamond for a day member. The room had a fridge with free soft drinks, fruit and big walk in shower. The bed was comfy and the room was totally quiet.

The executive lounge is much better than others I’ve been too. In the evening they served buffet food and drinks including champagne and smoked salmon, prawns, quiche, sausage rolls and cheeses. It was stylish and peaceful. Hopefully this model can become the benchmark for other Hilton’s in London to aspire to. I’d happily pay full price for an executive room if I knew it could be this good across the Hilton London range.",5,2019,12,16
120,Excellent stay at Bankside,"This is a newer hotel located in a relatively quiet business district. Its proximity to the Tube, 7 min walk to Southwark station, makes it a great base to see all of London. The front desk and management was very professional and efficient. The breakfast offerings were excellent with many options to suit all tastes. Highly recommend the Executive lounge as it offers a host of benefits; among which is a Afternoon tea, and a nice selection of wine.

120,Hilton Happiness,"Wonderful two night stay in this well appointed and beautiful hotel located near to Tate Modern, five minute walk from Southwark Tube. Could not fault service all round, particularly food and beverages. Fantastic breakfast, great choices. Enjoyed the complementary wine and we will be back. ",5,2019,12,13
120,Yasmina’s exceptional customer service ,I stay in Hilton’s in London on a regular basis and the bankside location is one of my favourites. I’d like to especially thank Yasmina for her excellent customer service. I had an early check in and business meetings that I had to attend in the afternoon. Yasmina took my bags for me and when ready made sure they were in my room and text me when room was ready. Thanks Yasmina. ,5,2019,12,09
120,Return Customer- Highly Satisfied,"Have been coming here for years, a beautiful and well maintained property and my favourite in London. The service on this occasion was five star. Yasmina, her manager, the gentlemen who helped with luggage and G at the bar went out of their way to accommodate a high maintenance request 😀 and make my stay enjoyable. That’s rare so they deserve recognition for the kindness, attention to details and care. Thank you all. I would return without a doubt.",5,2019,12,09
120,Sanctuary in the Middle of London,"The Hilton Bankside is a wonderful retreat. The décor is modern but still feels warm and welcoming.  Reception was friendly and efficient. Porters are there to assist the minute you arrive.

We decided to upgrade to an executive room and it was worth it.  Rooms are large and include all kinds of extra snacks, sodas and water in the mini-fridge.  King bed was comfortable but could use better pillows.  They would go flat quickly.  Bathroom had a good shower.  This room included access to the lounge which is one of the best we have ever experienced with Hilton.  Food and drinks were excellent both in the morning and evening.  In the afternoon, tea and scones are offered as well.  The lobby also has a nice bar and restaurant.

Only disappointment was the knowledge of the staff when asking questions.  Servers in the bar did not know the items on the menu.  Concierge also had to look up simple directions to popular landmarks within walking distance.  At this level, you expect the staff to be well versed in their positions.  Needless to say, even if they did not know the answers, they would always try to get you the information.

Overall, this hotel was excellent.  Cannot wait to return to London to stay at this Hilton.",5,2019,12,08
120,Excellent,"My family and I really had a great time there. The room was nice, comfortable, clean and warm. The breakfast is excellent with very friendly staffs. Afternoon tea and happy hour in the lounge was also great. Finally and most importantly, the front desk is very helpful and kind all the time. I will definitely be back in my next visit to London.
房間非常舒適寬敞，早餐餐廳餐點多樣化而且美味，行政酒廊的餐點也很棒！每天都不一樣。最重要的是，不論是前台或是餐廳的員工都非常樂於助人而且友善。我們享受了一個很棒又難忘的假期，下次我還是會選擇這裡，謝謝你們。",5,2019,12,07

The room was spacious, clean and comfortable.Good size bathroom, excellent shower and towels are soft (important). Always enjoy my stays here and it is my first choice when staying in London.
Lounge offers a good range of food, especially in the evening with salmon and prawns. Wines are OK, inoffensive. Staff professional and courteous.",5,2019,12,07

120,Not as expected,"Not a family hotel, seemed more for business. 
Not helpful in room allocation, although I booked early to secure a good room (connecting) but ended up with two rooms with a shared corridor. Was not convenient. 

Beds are comfortable 

Rooms are small

No views 

Breakfast is ok

Staff at the Lounge were very courteous.  Will definitely come back.",5,2019,12,04
120,An excellent Hilton,One of the better Hilton properties in London and I have tried most! Not much recognition as a Gold member and never seem to get an upgrade but it’s a newish hotel with great size rooms lovely friendly staff and great breakfast. TV reception was terrible in our room 127 reported on check out so I am sure it will be sorted. Room service was delivered quickly and also of good quality.,4,2019,12,02
120,An excellent stay,"We only stayed one night, wish it had been longer.  For a London hotel a very nice sized room, very clean, and all the amenities one would expect from a Hilton. The staff were super friendly too.  Will definitely be back.",5,2019,12,01
120,Excellent! Superb service and very comfortable.,"Had a great night at the Hilton Bankside - stayed overnight and attended an awards event too.  Rooms were a good size, had everything you'd need, comfortable bed and great shower.  My only negative was the drinks at the bar were very expensive. Location is great in walking distance of the Tate Modern, Millenium bridge, St.Pauls etc.",5,2019,11,30
120,The Best Hilton in London. ,"I’m a Hilton Gold member, and have stayed just under 60 nights this year alone in Hilton properties both in London, Europe, USA & Indonesia - this one is by far one of the very best, and absolutely the best one on offer in London. Hilton should use this as a model hotel to build others on. 

Rooms are spotless and a good size, staff are exemplary, breakfast is fabulous, the pool is beautiful (if not a little cold), and the location couldn’t be better. 

I took advantage of the concierge parking, for £40 an evening, which whilst is expensive (I don’t care what Hilton say, this is expensive), was convenient for my situation. 

I’d absolutely stay here again, and I’d encourage anyone else looking at London Hilton’s to give this one a try. ",5,2019,11,27
120,Our new fav in London,As Hilton Honors Diamond members we almost always stay at Hilton properties. This has become one of our favorites. We have stayed in at least 5 different London Hiltons and this is one of their best. The hotel and rooms are spotless. The staff is great. The location is good being within minutes of both Northern and Jubilee line underground stops. The Tate Modern and the Borough Market is close by as well. We will be back. ,5,2019,11,26

120,Excellent service,"This is our 4th year at Hilton Bankside, we're Diamond and had to ask for a better room, but they accommodated us, everything was great.  Special shout out to Guest Relations Manager, Anthony Samms.  He went out of his way for us, I trust he would do this for any guest that needs assistance in any way.   Rooms are always clean, restaurants are good, excellent location.  We are loyal to the brand, this property doesn't disappoint.  For 10 years stayed at Hilton Tower Bridge, glad we switched to this property.",5,2019,11,22
120,Brilliant staff,"Not only is this hotel beautiful!! But the staff were so helpful and friendly. Wanted to sort a surprise out for my husband and Angelo, Stefania & the concierge team couldn't have been more helpful in sorting this out for me. Thank you so much ",5,2019,11,19

120,Best Location for Walking to EVERYTHING ,"From this hotel I walked to; London Tower, Tower Bridge, Shard, Gherkin, Soho millennium bridge, London Bridge, St Paul's Cathedral, Coca Cola Eye, The Mall, Waterloo station and many other amazing Lonond sites. I didn't want to leave honestly.",5,2019,11,16
120,Got engaged here,"Excellent hotel, clean good staff and even offered prosecco as we checked in

Good location and excellent breakfast 

One downside was that the pool doesn’t have a sauna or steam room and the whirlpool bit isn’t heated more than pool",5,2019,11,14
120,Always a great stay,"As always staying at Hilton Bankside is a pleasure. Everything is as you would expect it to be with polite, helpful staff, comfortable rooms and good food. It is ideally located for either business or pleasure. Use of the Executive Lounge is ideal and Simona Dragut cannot do enough to ensure that you are properly looked after, she is a real credit to Hilton Hotels.",5,2019,11,14
120,Great hotel and great service ,"Lovely hotel with clean, spacious and comfortable rooms. Nice bathroom and excellent service. The breakfast was of a high standard and lots of choices.

120,Mr B W Andrews,"Warm welcoming and very friendly reception staff. Offered glass of Prosecco each on arrival . This was a nice touch. My wife and I have traveled extensively and stayed in some great hotels but this was right up there for style and comfort.Seamless check in. Room was beautiful and comfortable, complimentary bottles of water plus tea and coffee making facilities,  lovely hotel easy and convenient location. My wife and I are already planning our next stay.",5,2019,11,12
120,Good choice but mind your distances,"Very Nice Hotel. Comfortable and spacious room, and all the equipment and necessities you could expect from a 5 star hotel. The only  caviat would be that except from the Tate Modern, it seems a little far from everywhere (about 1km walk more or less) so when it rains it can be somewhat uncomfortable to walk that distance.",5,2019,11,12
120,"good service, very comfortable stay","Staffs were very nice. We requested an extra bed and they prepare a king size and very comfortable one. Also very good location, we went for a walk along the River Thames almost everyday. Indoor pool were very good too. Only a few more things to be perfect. Breakfast didn't change at all during our 5 days of stay. There was water leak from bathtub (the seal between bathtub and glass was not good enough) every time we had shower.",4,2019,11,10
120,Great stay and wonderful service!,"My colleague and I had a great business trip to the Hilton Bankside and we were thoroughly impressed by the accommodations and service. Our room was cozy and had great amenities, and the service provided by the staff was stellar. In particular, Alexsandar Kanev provided amazing service that really stood out. I highly recommend this hotel for it's quality in rooms and service, as well as its great location! Thank you for a great stay!",5,2019,11,07
120,Perfect,"An absolute beaut of a hotel, staff are very friendly & cannot do enough for you. Great location. Great facilities. Bought my mum here for 2 nights for her birthday & we will definately be returning.
A gem of a hotel",5,2019,11,06
120,happy to return,"We enjoyed this hotel so much in 2018 that we returned in 2019.  This is an excellent hotel in terms of service, location, or anything you could think of to measure it.  We arrived a couple of hours prior to check in and were fortunate enough to get an early check in.  The room was quite nice, as it had been in our previous stay.  I am not sure if I noted in 2018's review that a room card is necessary to use the elevators to the rooms, which gives an extra layer of security.  Breakfast was excellent each day.  The chef makes a fantastic omelette.  I highly recommend it.  There were always such pleasant people working to greet us in the hotel.  The Executive Lounge was also quite nice.  I stopped by for Afternoon Tea on one occasion and the scones were as great as I remembered.  My only suggestion in the lounge would be to add caffeine free sodas.",5,2019,11,04
120,Another wonderful stay at the Hilton London Bankside hotel,"This was our 3rd stay at the Hilton London Bankside. We love the located in Southwark, right behind the Tate Modern and Southbank, Thames: walking distance to The Tate Modern, Millenium Bridge & St.Paul's Cathedral, Blackfriars and The Globe theatre.",5,2019,11,03
120,Great Stay!,"Stayed here for 8 nights in the middle of October.  I was tagging along with my mother who was there for work in the Blue Fin building so it was chosen due to the location.  It was a lovely hotel with beautiful fresh flowers, great amenities, nice gym and a great location out of the hustle of downtown London.  Much more relaxed, which was appreciated with all the ""demonstrations"" going on.  Very nice bathroom and bedroom.  Loved the treats that housekeeping left a couple of afternoons. Very close to the Tate Modern and Borough Market.  Would definitely recommend.",5,2019,11,03
120,Very comfortable stay,Attention to detail in this hotel is very evident. Rooms are fantastic and staff are very helpful and professional. Deluxe rooms are a good size and the hotel has plenty of open areas to sit and relax. Nice bar and restaurant.,4,2019,11,03
120,Loved the Energy,"Our family of 4 stayed in the executive room for 2 nights. It is a modern hotel with nice decor and a very good executive lounge. Right next to the Tate Museum. Lots of places to eat nearby. 

The room was spacious and modern. It was great to have two toilets for 4 of us. The couch bed was not quite comfortable as the lower part of the bed was sagging. 

We also ordered room service one night and had some Asian inspired rice noodle dishes, which was almost inedible..... 

The personnel was all friendly, smiley and eager to meet your every request. Excellent!

I would take two rooms next time as the couch bed was not comfortable and would skip the room service but other than that, I would highly recommend this Hilton!",4,2019,11,02
120,A Hilton Gem,"Not sure if there are better Hilton's in the Greater London area (I've tried most of them).

Fixtures and furnishings still felt new. Service was excellent. Very, Very, did I say Very comfortable bed with lovely high quality bedding 

Breakfast buffet was very good and the wifi worked flawlessly.

Wouldn't hesitate to return.",4,2019,10,28
120,half term break,very good hotel overall.  southward tube station is close by.  lots of interesting places to visit in vicinity.  plenty of places to eat nearby.  hotel staff were friendly particularly the concierge and some of the staff in the executive lounge.  hotel rooms are spacious and clean.  our room looked in to a central courtyard so no view.  room was however quiet and temperature was good without using air conditioning.,4,2019,10,26
120,Perfection,"As a Hilton Diamond member, I've stayed at 100s of Hilton family hotels (including five other Hilton's in London) and this may be the best.  It's very modern and stylish with decent-sized rooms.  The staff is amazing and bent over backwards throughout our stay to consistently exceed expectations.  From the front desk, to guest relations, to restaurant staff, to executive lounge staff, to housekeeping - everyone was exceedingly friendly, helpful, and had an incredible attention to detail.",5,2019,10,25
120,5 star hotel. 3.5 star food,"Beautiful hotel. The nicest Hilton I’ve ever stayed in. Rooms are lovely. Huge comfy bed and bedding. Soft Towels. Robe. Proper hairdryer. Everything looked brand new. Staff excellent too. Didn’t have breakfast but did eat an evening meal and conference food. All Ok but way too salty and greasy for my taste. 

V near to Tate modern, Borough Market. and the globe. ",5,2019,10,24
120,A perfect place to tour London,The place is absolutely suited to tour London. It is walking distance to historical sites and places. It is also a quick access to public transport like the tube and buses. The hotel itself  is well maintained and looks absolutely elegant and well furnished too If I may add. Breakfast is great with good choices of food. From the hotel we toured Boroughs Market which was a very interesting place with plenty of good buys. Definitely recommend the place...,5,2019,10,23
120,Great hotel with superb Executive Lounge,"We stayed in a one bed suite for 3 nights in October. 
Room - very modern, perfectly clean and with all the nice bits you’d expect. Good inclusive mini bar too. Huge bed which was really comfy with crisp sheets. Lush. 
Exec lounge - fantastic!  Great breakfast and eggs cooked to order too. Afternoon tea was lovely with warm scones. Evening snacks and free flowing wine/beer/bubbles/ spirits was a real treat. Simona Dragut looked after us so well - she’s a credit to the hotel. 
Hotel - great location, right next to Tate and with loads to do all along the river. 
Will definitely return. ",5,2019,10,23
120,Very nice hotel!,"Centrally located and modern hotel. We had a room with a very narrow and small window, it felt very claustrophobic. They were very nice and immediately switched our room to a larger and airier room. The buffet breakfast was terrific!!",4,2019,10,22
120,the best Hilton ever,"Professional and kind staff--every single person we came in contact with was polite and helpful. Hotel was well staffed, clean, and nicely laid out. Food was great too. We will not stay anywhere else in London. It is the BEST!",5,2019,10,22
120,Amazing ,"I’ve stayed at many Hilton’s in my time, but I have to say that the service I got here was the best. 

My husband and I arrived at the hotel to be greeted by very friendly staff and a glass of champagne. We were then upgraded as a gesture of goodwill, which was very welcomed as it was my husband’s birthday. 

The room was clean and spacious and the bathroom was gorgeous. 

The locality of this hotel to where we needed to go was super. 

Great hotel, great staff and an amazing bar. ",5,2019,10,22
120,Great stay,"Very helpful staff, felt very welcomed when we arrived. The hotel looks very good, very clean and cool. The restaurant and bar are on the expensive side, as you can expect as for hotel services. Rooms are very well equipped and the rooms excellent..",5,2019,10,20
120,Absolutely amazing hotel,"The hotel staff are all very polite, friendly and could not do enough for you. The hotel itself was very clean and and welcoming. The room we stayed in was clean, comfortable and everything we need for our stay. We opted for the valet parking and the concierge staff remembered our names, what car we had and nothing was ever a problem. We left our luggage in the boot as we got there around 9:30am (check in is at 3pm) and at 10:45am we got a text from the reception staff saying that our room was ready and our luggage was in our room waiting. 

Definitely worth a stay here you will not be disappointed!",5,2019,10,20
120,Top Choice for London Stay,"I chose this hotel based on a good long weekend rate.  While it might not seem as central as other hotels, the location turned out to be very workable… it's a short walk to either a tube station or two train stations for exploring the city and beyond.  The area around the hotel seems to be up and coming, with some good restaurant choices nearby and small variety stores for picking up snacks and drinks.

After a five-night stay, I can say that the room had every amenity you could want and the service from hotel staff was excellent.  I was amazed at the size of the room, compared to the last shoe box size room I had in London.  There was a king size bed, which was incredibly comfortable with high end linens, a desk and long table and still plenty of room for suitcases and walking around.  There was a mini fridge, a large safe, an iron that actually worked and a new TV with a good selection of channels.
  
Even better was the bathroom, where everything worked, with enough space to move around and a large walk in glass shower.  The only negative to the room was the view, which was of an inside court with a brick wall. But considering the low height of the building, I don’t think a room facing the street would have had a much better view.

The check in service was very professional, with Stefania helping to find us this good room, even at an early arrival time. She gave us a complimentary pass to a couple of London tourist sites, which was a nice perk.  When my North American travel adapter blew a fuse in the room, not only did the electrician fix it right away, but he loaned us a spare converter for the duration of the stay.  All the staff said hello whenever they saw you and could not have been more welcoming.

This is one of the top Hilton’s that I have stayed at in awhile and I absolutely recommend it for your next stay in London.",5,2019,10,19
120,"Modern, Pricey and luxerious in great location","Great hotel, very nice room, super service and fantastic location, central to everything.   There is a nice pub on the block, Tesco experess and 5 other restaurants nearby.   Got the rate that includes breaksfast, very good breakfast, everything from cook to order eggs/omletts and pancakes and tons of fresh fruit, great health options too!    My only complaint is that you can not get coffee before 6:30AM when the restaurant opens and you can not get your own ice.   Very annoying that I have to call room service to get ice, for todays world, this is not acceptable anymore.  The hotel bar does have 100 different gins, but I would go to the Charlotte and get a real double for half the price.",4,2019,10,14
120,Wonderful stay in Bankside,"Traveled to London several times, but this was the first time we stayed in the Bankside/South Bank area.  The hotel had a modern touch, was well-kept and the staff were very friendly and attentive.  The room was clean and bed very comfortable.  Big window let in a lot of light.  Location is tucked away on a quieter street, yet only a couple blocks from the bustling bankside shops and restaurants.  Would definitely stay here again!",5,2019,10,13
120,"Strikes the Right Balance - Cost, Value, Luxury, Location","When planning this trip I had a heck of a time trying to decide where to stay - soooo many great name brand hotels and most are over in another area of town. When I really took a look at the prices and what a small room I would get - I decided to take a chance on this Hilton.

For less money than the other hotels, I was able to have a room 2x the size, breakfast/afternoon tea/evening cocktails included. Quality of the room, the food, service - outstanding.

Location - although not right in the middle of it all - I was able to easily access all via the Tube. Very manageable with an Oyster card.

Child friendly location - swimming pool, even received a lovely fox stuffed animal :)",5,2019,10,12
120,Location Location Location,"Hilton Bankside one of the best Hiltons i've ever stayed at.  Top notch from start to finish, location, value, property and staff.  Way to go Bankside, and one of the best included breakfasts i've ever had in a Hilton.",5,2019,10,11
120,Another great stay at my favourite Hilton in London,"As a Hilton Honors member I have stayed at lots of the Hilton properties across London and the Bankside is my favourite. The staff are really friendly from The GM James to Vlad at the bar. The hotel is in a good location by the Tate Modern and a nice walk across the Millennium Footbridge to St Pauls. Rooms are nice, bathrooms are excellent with really large showers and there are leisure facilities with a pool. Although the executive lounge and bar are really good, there are lots of other dining options nearby. Good transport links from Blackfriars and Southwark stations.",5,2019,10,08
120,Fab hotel,"This was a gem of a hotel to stay in. We stayed club level and heartily recommend this option. Rooms were spacious and well furnished. Beds very comfy. Staff helpful and location great, near to Borough Market and tube stop a 5 min walk away. Would definitely stay here again",5,2019,10,07
120,value for money,The staff were very friendly. Breakfast was very good with a wide selection to choose from. The In-room dinning was served promptly as promised. i requested for vegetable salad to be added to the prawn cocktail and this was graciously done even though it wasn't that way in the menu. I was served by Alexsandar Kanev and he was very courteous and quite good face of HILTON. I will recommend this hotel without hesitation,4,2019,10,07
120,Like home,"The best staff in London bar none. From the GM on down,they truly care about the people who come to stay in their hotel. The Executive Lounge is great, the room was great and the location is ideal. Trust me, you want to stay here when in London. ",5,2019,10,07
120,Great Customer Service,"From Check-In to Check-Out, the service here was exemplary.  The concierge was very helpful.  Very good breakfast with a lot of offerings, of course starting with a full English Breakfast.  Custom egg orders.  Lots of selections.

Bar area was inviting.  Wait staff very friendly.",5,2019,10,06
120,Just the best Hilton around,"I stay in Hiltons alot and have been a Diamond member for years. All Hiltons are of a good standard, but I can safely say this hotel round the back of Tate Modern is exceptional. Whether with Business or with the family it’s just great and has a lovely homely atmosphere. 
There are too many members of staff to call out for exceptional service, but Ali who mans the egg station in the morning is worthy of a mention, a true gent and just the best at omlette chef ever.
Have meant to write a review for years but never got around to it, the picture shows what prompted me.
Like I said just a fantastic hotel, would thoroughly recommend. ",5,2019,10,01
120,We had s great stay.,We had a great stay. The rooms were cozy and modern at the same time. Clean as expected. Service was great all over. They catered well for allergies and the executive lounge staff were amazing in all regards. We will be back for sure.,5,2019,09,30
120,Beautiful hotel!,"A top Hilton Hotel with amazing service, attention to details, food and location. You can walk everywhere and enjoy the city life of London.  The turn down service is bonus  and the staff was amazing.  Rooms are new, nice and modern.  Love the location near the river. Executive longe is the best one. ",5,2019,09,29
120,Wonderful Hotel,"We stayed here for a week and really have very few complaints. This is a wonderful hotel with attentive staff.  The executive lounge (and its staff) is remarkable.  Decent continental breakfast, and beverages throughout the day, and topped off with wine and cocktails and appetizers in the evening.  The hotel is located close enough to the river front to enjoy a leisurely stroll to Tate Modern or the Bankside Pier for transport, or to the many shops and restaurants located in that area.  There is a tube stop about a 5-8 minute walk (Southwark) from the hotel.  The millennium footbridge takes you right to St. Paul’s and it is an easy walk to Borough Market, Globe and the Shard.  We have been coming to London for over 20 years and have stayed in many different hotels and neighborhoods but can honestly say that this hotel is the best we’ve ever stayed in. To be fair we did upgrade to a one bedroom suite and having a separate sitting area (and a bath and a half) made the stay more homey and comfortable.  We had a separate bedroom with a connected full bath and a sitting room with a hallway of closets and a half bath. The only cons I would list is:  the lack of a view—in fact we were overlooking train tracks but the soundproofing is such that we were never disturbed by train noise.  The other side of the hotel would probably give you a slight view of the Thames.  The 2 restaurants in the hotel were fine though a little bit of a sparse menu if you aren’t looking for bar food however we were able to get a sandwich to share the few times we stayed in for lunch or dinner.  The one restaurant/bar caters to lovers of Gin and has an interesting drink menu. All in all, I recommend this hotel highly!  We’ll be back!!",5,2019,09,28
120,Best Hilton at London,"I’m a such Hilton fan and one of my favorite things when I visit a place is my stay at Hilton hotel . This time I choose Hilton Bankside for celebrating my birthday and I had marvelous time there! Great room and delicious breakfast! My special thanks for Jhiye, and the guest relation team - You’re made my day special and I’m very glad for it.  Best Hilton at London ever!",5,2019,09,26
120,Beautiful hotel in a great location,"The hotel feels like it is brand new inside - it has a great feel to it, in the public areas and in the rooms.

As gold members, we were upgraded to an executive room with lounge access, which was a very pleasant surprise. Although the lounge food and drink selection wasn't overwhelming, it was a nice quiet spot to recharge before heading out in the evenings.

Location-wise, you are just a moment's walk to Tate Modern, the Millenium Bridge and all the other visitor attractions in that area - it's all very easy to walk to and around, and there are a number of restaurants and pubs within a few minutes walk.",5,2019,09,23
120,All hotels should be like this,"Had a weekend in London and stayed at this extra special hotel. Had a long drive to the hotel so decided to use their car park at the last minute and was greeted by an friendly doorman who happily parked my car, lovely receptionist checked us in with a smile and glass of champagne. Hotel rooms are large for London and very comfortable, breakfast is very good and the basement pool was lovely. It’s a great location near the Southbank and although not the cheapest place to stay is worth the money. Will be staying here again.",5,2019,09,22
120,"excellent service, great food, beautiful accomodation","excellent service, great food, beautiful accomodation
All the staff was helpful and we asked a lot of questions as it was our first visit to London.  There is a small grocery and a pub on the same block.  Two blocks to Tate Modern.  ",5,2019,09,20
120,Exceptional find!,"This Hilton exceeded my expectations. I found it on Trip Advisor by searching traveler-ranked but was pleased to see it was rated even higher for value. Both ratings well deserved. 

Room was extremely clean and cared for.  Really liked the layout across from the bed: frig, coffee set, drawer and chair under a long surface that could accommodate our suitcases, backpacks, etc.  

Staff was consistently attentive throughout: front desk; concierge; Josh & Taighe and Jess at the bar. In the restaurant Alessi, Timo and Alvaro made us feel like treasured guests every meal. Breakfast was a good variety. 

A block or two to the Tate Modern and the Millennium Bridge and two or three to the Southwark tube station.  I believe what we saved on this room versus others I considered more than covered any longer taxi rides. And London being such a large place, nowhere you stay is close to all the sights.

120,Leisure and comfort,"September 9-14 - checked in around noon but room not yet ready (was ready at around 230 pm).  Room was on 3rd floor quiet side of hotel away from elevator (as requested).

Room was incredible.  Interior room (so not much of a view but I did not mind).  Bedroom was a nice size with king bed and beautiful bathroom with dual shower heads (traditional and rain).  Room felt new and clean.  

I had small issue with housekeeping not providing extra towels when requested with room cleaning each day.

Hilton honors breakfast amenity the hot food was not that great but the breakfast options were decent.

This hotel also has a pool.

The hotel is a little far from closest subway (about 10-15 minutes walking).

For the room I’d stay at this hotel again.  It’s a sanctuary after a long day of touring.

120,Weekend in London,"This is a great hotel, not the cheapest price, but not bad value for London. Great location, easy access to the tube. Room good quality and very clean / new. Staff very customer focused and friendly and helpful. We had an evening meal in the restaurant that was very good, but pricey. We had breakfast at Starbucks opposite the Tate gallery, a 2 minute walk away - nicer surroundings, no que's and much better value and coffee!",5,2019,09,18
120,"Excellent Gem of Hotel, Great Location for Tourists","Here is my review to Hilton about my stay: 

I found this hotel by accident, using a online hotel service.  The price was right, discounted because I ordered months in advance.  After 3 weeks of touring Europe, this hotel was a DELIGHTFUL experience.  The greetings by multiple staff when we arrived was unexpected, and felt very sincre. ( We had been hiking in the Alps, and looked like scruffy Boomer back packers, boots and all.)  We loved the design and appointments of the hotel and our room.  The bathroom was exceptional, so nice that we photographed it for use in our next remodel.  The quality of the bed, linens etc were much enjoyed. 

The big surprize was the hotels  proximity to the Tate Modern, Covent Gardens, Theatre,  etc. Your location is very walkable for tourists!  We walked ten miles in one day, totally enjoying it.  ( And we discovered Gails, the bakery near the Tate, that is world class!) 

We learned, through digging on the internet, is that there is a direct train to Gatwick from Blackfriars... you should promote that to the many first time visitors to London. That is almost magical to a visitor who doesn't know how to use the underground with confidence. To walk with rolling luggage to Blackfairs and on to Gatwick was awesome, hassle free ( except for the cancel trains due to weekend work overuns!)  

 We will be back next time we visit London.  Our room in the hotel was a perfect oasis to recover from our Alpen hiking trip.  ",5,2019,09,17
120,Great hotel,Good service; nice rooms.  Very comfortable.  Treated with respect.  Goes out of their way to help.  Close to tube transport.  near the Tate modern.  Food was good.  Complimentary water and slipper each night.,5,2019,09,16
120,Very nice Hilton with great service ,"This hotel is located just a short 10 minute walk from the south bank near to the Tate modern. It’s one of the best Hilton brand hotels I’ve stayed in. The service was impeccable, attentive but relaxed. Food and drink in the bar were reasonably priced and the hotel decor is really modern but warm. The rooms are very clean and light with extremely comfortable beds. 
We really enjoyed our stay here and hope to visit again on a future visit.",5,2019,09,16
120,Birthday breakfast,"Lovely overnight stay, very comfy luxurious beds.  Staff very helpful with an early check in, service excellent. Breakfast really good. Enjoyed the pool and gym. Will definitely be back. A lovely treat and relax",5,2019,09,14
120,"Loved the location, rooms were devine and pretty good service","We stayed at the Hilton London Bankside for 4 nights in early August. It was a fantastic stay and I would recommend this hotel.  Arriving from NZ we were pretty jet lagged, and the room was just bliss, it was modern, dark, with a super comfortable bed.  The bathroom was excellent and well appointed.
The check in wasn't particularly warm and friendly, as the girl didn't speak English as her first language.  But we were given a glass of presecco which was a nice touch.  We ordered room service drinks and a meal one night, it was good, a little pricey and the staff member stayed for longer than perhaps necessary and was a little awkward as it was his first day.
We could walk everywhere from here and loved that we could get to the Borough market by foot and the tube so easily. Very close to Train station too.  There is amazing coffee round the corner at The Black Sheep too.",5,2019,09,12
120,"First rate, modern Hilton, low-rise with good elevator service","Roughly halfway (8 minutes) between Southwark and Blackfriars Tube stops. Southwark has a more level route for suitcase rolling. Blackfriars is on a direct line to the Heathrow Express at Paddington Station, but that is over ten stops away. The cars on that line are spacious and air conditioned, and we got seats with our luggage, in the morning rush hour. The Southwark Tube station connects to Waterloo-East (not the same as Waterloo) National Rail, but where our independent Southeastern train daytrip to Sissinghurst Castle Garden (closest rail stop, Staplehurst, £19.95 pre-booked taxi to the garden.) made its first stop after we boarded at Waterloo Station. However, that Tube stop-Waterloo East connection involves the paid-Tube zone and is better avoided (by going outdoors) if you are not using the Tube.

15-minute walk to The Shard, 8-minute walk to Thames piers by Blackfriars Bridge, 3-minute walk to Tate Modern, 6 minutes to Globe Theater, 12 minutes to Waterloo Station, Young Vic, Old Vic. Nearest chain pub The White Hart merely “satisfactory.” Many gentrifying coffee and snack options walkable, plus three chain convenience stores like Tesco Express.

Large Executive Lounge behind lobby Registration desks. Afternoon tea hours including scones and clotted cream 2-4? plus canapés and alcohol 5:30-7:30. (Alcohol continues to 8PM.) Our spacious room 231 had a diagonal wall for some reason, and the large desk was behind the headboard of the King bed. Full height windows on courtyard/pedestrian alley facing Kirkaldys Testing Works. (A tiny Engineering museum open only a few hours a week.) Huge modern shower stall (only) with rain head/Euro hose option. No shower curtain, one step up. Excellent air conditioning. No CNN on flat screen TV but had Food Network. Relatively poor TV channels and slow to load, but good HD resolution. Interior hallways are long.

Small breakfast in Executive Lounge, extra charge huge buffet 6:30AM with eggs and pancakes to order in restaurant. Gluten free options available, soy milk and almond milk in refrigerated buffet. Soy milk was spoiled one morning. Plenty of healthy choices but no whole-grain type bread. Two flavors of Granola, Bran Flakes, hot Scotch oatmeal, and standard sugary cereals. Satisfactory sweet pastries. Drip coffee from waiters, two automated espresso machines. (Go to page 2 of push-button screen for large cup of steamed milk.) Dining room is understaffed so coffee can be delayed.

Room key needed for elevator. Small gym and decent lap pool in basement. No leg machines, no light hand weights, no kettle bells. One articulated workout bench. Enough treadmills and ellipticals. Very nice locker rooms with lockable lockers, showers, and swimsuit extractor. Hotel building is not very tall so elevator service was excellent. Our room had turndown service three of six days. Three days, our room was made-up after 5 PM, so use the doorknob request sign if you plan to return before dinner.",4,2019,09,11
120,The best Hilton I have stayed in - faultless!,"Unfortunately we only stayed for 1 night - but I would like to thank all the excellent staff for our treatment.
In particular Alessandra on reception who was so kind to us and was responsible for me getting a cake
for my birthday - such a lovely surprise.

Everything about this hotel is first rate.   We stayed in an Executive Room which was superb with access
to the Exec Lounge - the staff in there were so attentive in particular Dylan who couldn't do enough for us.
The best Executive lounge we have been in.
This is the first time we have stayed in this Hilton but it won't be the last.",5,2019,09,10
120,Top Level Service,My daughter and I stayed for 3 night in this hotel. Located just 200m from Tube station creates access to everywhere. All staff embraced that they need to provide high level of service and this creates an excellent stay. Last year we had very bad experience at London Hilton Metropole Hotel and moved the Bankside and left very happy. This year it is still the same it is exceptionally good. We stayed in a twin room (415) and I found bathtub height very high. We did not have any problem though some elderly people might find it very difficult. I hope other rooms are not the same.,5,2019,09,08
120,Fabulous Hotel,"Always helps to be upgraded to a suite 

Great room (healthy mini bar was free and amused me, definitely no alcohol in it but still a perk)

Lots of space, separate dining/seating area, bathroom fab, huge shower and I mean Huge as was the whole space.

Executive lounge for breakfast was a real plus, usual Hilton Exec lounges are eggs bacon toast and yogurt. Not here, practically full breakfast options. Opted for Smoked salmon and eggs.

Also held a meeting in the lounge later, loads of space so private and good options for afternoon tea.

Room service and quality of food was great, far better options than most U.K. Hilton’s.

Management team at this hotel have it spot on.

I will definitely return.

",5,2019,09,08
120,Great Hilton,"Stayed at the Hilton London Bankside for a fun long weekend stay. I've stayed at over 100 Hilton properties, and this is easily one of the best. Everything about the hotel was well done. All of the things that I look for in a hotel were satisfied by this property. Rooms were quiet, rooms had no smell, AC worked well, bed was comfortable (loved the duvet), shower was nice, staff was friendly, Hilton Honors diamond breakfast was incredible, and housekeeping with turn down service was nicely done. The executive lounge was the best Hilton lounge I've been to. Really liked the modern design of the rooms and the rest of the property. Would definitely stay again and would recommend to anyone. Thank you for a great stay!",5,2019,09,07
120,Hilton London Bankside,"This hotel was top notch from start to finish. The general manager, James Clarke was welcoming and very focused on providing the best hospitality. The room was large and quite comfortable. The bathroom had every luxury. Coming off a cruise with small bathrooms, this bathroom was a bit of heaven. The staff and John the concierge were very accommodating. They were extremely helpful with everything from booking taxis, to restaurant recommendations to where to buy souvenirs for our grandchildren. We enjoyed the executive lounge for both breakfast and evening cocktails. The hotel is positioned in such a way that we were able to walk to all the sights of London. I highly recommend this hotel and will stay here again on any trip to London. Thanks to all at Hilton London Bankside.",5,2019,09,06
120,"Top notch hotel, excellent location","Stayed here on our 3 day visit to London, one of the best hotels we’ve ever visited! The location is convenient to all of London sites, the hotel staff was superb, so friendly and accommodating.  The breakfast and evening tapas/drinks were a great touch.  We’ll definitely return!",5,2019,09,05
120,"Comfortable, convenient and slightly quirky","Had a last-minute chance to spend a weekend in London and delighted that we chose the Hilton Bankside. I was upgraded on arrival and we enjoyed our stay with a very comfortable room, very welcoming staff and a great breakfast buffet. Only wish that we could have stayed a little longer to enjoy the facilities. it did seem that the staff in the restaurant on the Sunday morning were overworked but that did not spoil our overall experience.",5,2019,09,05
120,Wonderful location and excellent hotel,"My husband and I stayed at The Hilton Bankside recently and we were extremely impressed by both the location and the hotel. The hotel itself is aesthetically pleasing inside with tasteful decor. We were welcomed with a glass of champagne and as we are Hilton diamond members were upgraded to a deluxe room which was spacious and well planned, the bed was comfortable and the room was quiet. The executive lounge was very comfortable and inviting and served both afternoon tea and drinks and canapés in the evening which were of a very high standard. The staff in the lounge were friendly and courteous. The breakfast here was one of the best that we have experienced in the many Hilton hotels that we have stayed in with an a la carte menu alongside the usual breakfast items which was complimentary to diamond members. We used the pool which was of a good size, there was also a gym and spa all of which were exceptionally clean and staffed by a friendly Portuguese member of staff. Overall we loved our stay at this hotel so much that we are already booked to return beginning of next month.",5,2019,09,05
120,Good hotel,"Location  of this hotel is great - just few tube stops away from Bond Street. Hotel rooms are clean and spacious. I really liked the deco of the rooms. If you have enough time to have a long breakfast, have a breakfast at the hotel, it’s really worth it.",4,2019,09,04
120,Wonderful hotel for a London city trip,"The hotel is perfectly located for a city trip, in 15 minutes you can walk to St. Pauls, 6mins to the closest underground station.

The hotel itself has a very nice modern design, the rooms are well decorated, breakfast in OXBO is highly recommended. All in all a perfect stay, can't wait to return.",5,2019,09,04
120,Excellent hotel - location perfect,"Stayed for 3 nights over a busy bank holiday weekend and the Hilton did not disappoint. Clean, modern rooms with all mod cons. Very quiet and no noise from outside. Front desk staff extremely helpful and friendly. Bar area was also nice and good terrace to sit outside and people watch. Location right opposite Tate Modern and 5 min walk to the river. Also 5-10 min walk from tube. Lots of cafes and bars around to choose from. Great hotel and stay, would definitely return.",5,2019,09,04
120,Absolutely wonderful hotel,"Stayed here for two evenings and thoroughly enjoyed every aspect of our stay. From check-in to check-out the Front Desk staff was exceptional. We sat out on the side patio during happy hour and enjoyed a few glasses of wine while people watching.  A special shout-out to the concierge, John, who is an excellent resource to tap for information on what’s around; Tania at the Front Desk; Anna at the Distillery lounge; and Sam the bellhop.  The rooms are lovely and the hotel is located close to many great sites. Cannot recommend this hotel enough.",5,2019,09,02
120,Stop reading and book it!,"We are loving our stay here! The staff is extremely helpful. The breakfast and variety and quality of nearby restaurants is excellent. It is very nice to be near the Thames, Tate Modern, tube, St Paul’s and Globe. The hotel is modern, with a heated indoor pool and larger than usual rooms for London. Taxis and Uber’s are plentiful. There is no noise at night. 

We will not bother looking elsewhere on our next trip here. ",5,2019,09,02
120,Best Hilton in london,"This hotel is amazing, from booking to checkout.

For a start this is the only Hilton I know of in London to enable the live chat.

Treatment of gold and diamond members is great, half price in the fantastic restaurant.

Got upgraded too so got club lounge access, it's the best club lounge in London.

Breakfast was great quality, not a huge choice but all quality.

Guest relations manager is great ( Chinese guy) and Paul the German restaurant supervisor was hopeful and nice to talk too.

Bed rooms very clean and modern.

The corridors are huge which gives the place a spacious feel.

I highly recommend this Hilton.",5,2019,09,02
120,Wonderful Stay,"We are just wrapping up our seven night stay at the Hilton Bankside. We had a wonderful stay. Our room was a deluxe king suite which came with executive lounge access.  We loved the main bathroom! Our room also came with a second very tiny half bathroom. We frequented the lounge during our stay. The lounge was well equipped with beverages. Food was okay. Since I am a Hilton Gold Member, we were entitled to free breakfast at the restaurant OXBO. Breakfast was very good. The hotel staff was superb. The pool is beautiful, and my husband was very happy with the gym. The only possible drawback to the hotel could be the location. If you like to step out of your hotel and be within quick walking distance of major attractions, this hotel may not be for you. For example, we walked from the hotel to the London Eye and it was about a 15-20 minute walk. There is an Underground Station a few blocks away. I would definitely not let the location deter me from staying here again. A must visit is Borough Market which is about a 10 minute walk from the hotel. ",5,2019,09,02
120,Real Gem,"This is a real find.  Quiet, spacious, well appointed rooms (interconnecting to the kids which was a bonus), top buffet breakfast and good service.  Walking distance to the loads of restaurants on the Southbank as well as Southwark and Blackfriars tubes.  Will definitely stay again.",5,2019,09,02
120,Great atay,Travelling as diamond members and had a fantastic stay! Great breakfasts and attentive service. Executive lounge can get busy but seems to have regular turnover you can swap seats easily. Good doorman service and quick to get taxis etc.. ,5,2019,08,31
120,The Best Breakfast ,"It’s a pleasure for us to come back every year. The breakfast is very nice. Thanks to Alessia, she welcomed us wonderfully. The rooms are silent and comfortable with a usb charger system for tablet and smartphone.",5,2019,08,31
120,Executive Lounge Cocktails ,"Amazing cocktails from Adam - i can recommend highly the Tom Collins. A margarita next Monday please!

Hotel is great, best Hilton in London, in fact best Hilton I’ve stayed at (waaaay better than any in the US) ",5,2019,08,29
120,A nice stay with just a few gripes.,"Smart hotel in a great location for the Tate and Borough Market. 

Great service and the pool is really nice. 

Very comfortable beds and breakfast was lovely and plentiful.  The food in the resturant (OXBO) was also of a very high standard (although quite pricey)

I booked using the Hilton App, I wasn't able to use the digital room key (which was disappointing).

A couple of gripes; 

The toweling bathrobes were both frayed on the sleeves (I noticed most of the others around the pool were in a similar condition). 

I wasn't allowed to take my dinner or drinks purchased from the in-house restaurant (OXBO) to my room. 

I would stay here again.",4,2019,08,27
120,Racist Blackface,Hilton London Bankside displayed racist artwork on our floor. I pointed it out to them and they took it down but claimed they had never noticed it. They had to research what blackface was because they “never heard of it”. The GM tried to relate by comparing the African American struggles around slavery to Irish persecution. The entire management team needs some sensitivity training!,1,2019,08,27
120,Gracious help in the executive lounge,I wanted to take a moment to mention how lovely the staff of the executive lounge was. Aleksandar always made a point to ask us how he could help. I also want to mention how helpful the staff was in the morning was. Whenever we popped in the staff was attentive to guests as well as to keeping the space well stocked. We visited over the August bank holiday weekend and it was quite hot out so I was grateful for the gracious reception. Well done Hilton Bankside!,5,2019,08,25
120,Perfect !!!,"We stayed at the Hilton Bankside for one incredible week in a suite with Executive Lounge Access and it was phenomenal! This new smaller hotel is perfectly located in a quiet central part of London within walking distance of most attractions. Our room was top notch ! Top floor corner suite with amazing amenities. The staff is extraordinary throughout. Gym, lounge, bar & restaurant all had amazing service! Food was exceptional from fresh to order omelettes at buffet, afternoon tea, bar apps, cocktail hour and finally steak at the OXO . Thank YOU HILTON ❤️🙏 As a Hilton Honours Silver member ... This trip reminds me why I book HILTON ❤️DO IT !",5,2019,08,24
120,Not the usual friendly greeting ,Checking in was not the friendliest welcome from a male on the check in. As a Dimond member normally get room upgrade sadly not here only second floor with no view apart from the other guests rooms so having to keep the curtains closed. Room was ok bathroom lovely. Lounge was nice not as much choice compared to other hotels with lounges. Although the afternoon tea was nice but the ham and mustard sandwich blew my head of with the amount of mustard. Breakfast was nice great selection and a friendly warm welcome from the staff. Location is good for the Tate but there are cheaper places don’t think I would stay again unless the price was right. ,3,2019,08,24
120,"Luxurious, clean hotel, great service, and friendly staff","I stayed for 5 nights at the beginning of August 2019. I believe I was upgraded to a better room than I have booked. The room was very spacious and the bathroom especially was awesome. The staff were really accommodating, especially Aleksandar went above and beyond with his attentiveness and service; I felt that he genuinely cared about my experience. The hotel itself is extremely close to Tate Modern, which was a plus for me, but besides that, one might have to travel a bit to get to where the action is in London, the only potential downside of the hotel. It was a great experience overall.",5,2019,08,22
120,Nice Pool and Breakfast ,"We recently stayed in this hotel during our trip to UK.  It’s very comfortable and good service.

There were two things we liked about this hotel.  Its indoor swimming pool is of good size (rare in London) and with good facilities.  We very much enjoyed the pool during our stay.  Secondly its coffee shop, OXBO, provided good breakfast buffet.  Highly recommended.",4,2019,08,21
120,"Lovely hotel for a night in London, although a little chaotic","I've stayed at the London Bankside a couple of times now, most recently in July for a weekend break. The hotel itself is lovely, very modern and the rooms are impeccable. 

Obviously it was the height of the summer season when we arrived, which is understandable, however at 3pm check in our room wasn't ready yet due to the hotel being full and rooms not being ready fast enough, which was disappointing as we had to get ready for an evening event. 

We left our bags and went to explore the area as we were told to come back later. We then came back and checked in after an hour or so. They said they'd send our bags up but these never arrived so we went down to get them ourselves. While the hotel is very nice, I would have thought for the price (£220 for 1 night, not including breakfast) the check in logistics would have been smoother, with more staff to hand. Just to offer a complimentary coffee or something while we waited would have been appreciated. 

Once we were in our room and had our bags it was very nice though, and we would recommend the hotel.",4,2019,08,21
120,Hilton London bankside,"Really great time had in this lovely hotel. Staff were always extremely helpful, couldn't do enough. Rooms are spacious and the best bed I've slept in in a long time. Would stay here again for sure. Very convenient location also.",5,2019,08,18
120,Travel break ,Having stayed at the Hilton Old Town Prague rather than head straight back to Malta a few days in London.  The hotel is still our favourite in the city and the executive lounge is still the best.  One problem where have the almond croissants gone one unhappy bunny (not me).  Otherwise impeccable as ever all the staff deserve praise their efforts make the stay!,5,2019,08,16
120,Lovely vibe,"We stayed here for a birthday weekend trip to London.
Very helpful staff (although there were some contradictions from them about restaurant meal and seating options etc).
Interesting vegan meal choices for me - light and tasty 'works of art'.
There's a fabulous vibe in the bar which is open to the public and had two hen-nights in attendance (but they were well-behaved). Again, very helpful and attentive staff.
Very large comfortable bed and spacious double shower.
I would have liked a mirror near to the hairdryer/socket and some brighter and warmer decor and picture(s) around - perhaps our room just needed a female touch :-)
Disappointed that we were asked to leave the swimming pool after only a few minutes because the maintenance team wanted to 'add chemicals to the water' ... pity they didn't wait until late at night to do that.
Sunday morning breakfast time was a bit busy and hectic - and some of the food choices were unavailable - but we did leave it until10.00am to go down to eat.
Our booked taxi (to return to the train station) didn't show up, and the concierge sorted out a replacement for us in record time.",4,2019,08,14
120,Looks just like the fabulous pictures online,I stayed here for my first trip to London in February and chose it because it was a Hilton and it was near the river.  The pictures online are true to life and my room was great. The bathroom is beautifully outfitted with all the latest fixtures and a shower to die for. My room was a really pleasant place to come back to to rest after walking around London all day. The pool and spa area also looks very high-end. The hotel's location is great - there are convenience stores and restaurants within 5 minutes in every direction. The tube is also a short 5-10 minute walk. The hotel is practically across the street from the Tate Modern and you can walk down to the river right to the Millennium Bridge with a great view of St. Paul's. I think the Southwark area is the place to be. It doesn't feel touristy or crowded like Kensington for example. I didn't have a car because I took the train everywhere so I didn't need parking but the hotel does have valet parking. The staff here are quite nice and helpful (which I needed because I'm the idiot American who couldn't figure things out :). I was always greeted when I came in the door and someone was always right there if I had a confused look on my face. There is a restaurant attached which looks quite good with a nice atmosphere but I didn't have a chance to try it as I was itching to get out into London. I'm always going to stay here when I come to London. I found the perfect hotel and I'm not going to mess with a good thing.,5,2019,08,13
120,Hilton Bankside - excellent service as usual,"This is an excellent hotel and I try to stay here whenever I am in London. Can be a bit pricey sometimes, but generally my first preference hotel - great rooms, service, breakfast and my wife loves it!",5,2019,08,13
120,Always my first chouce,"I can not remember the amount of times I have stayed in this hotel, but I thought I would write another review after my first one 2 years ago. I recommend this hotel to all my friends and family as it is always welcoming. Even though it is not in a central location don’t be put off by this. The river is a few minutes walk from the hotel, right near the Tate and then use this is a starting point to wander along the river either towards the London Eye or just jump on the tube (again not difficult to get to a tube station)
Front of house are always helpful, especially Jasmin who found us to give us our room key and made our stay special. 
Concierge is always fab and looks after your bags and nothing is too much trouble.
Guest relations are helpful and always willing to answer any questions. 
The gym and pool are always clean, when using facilities never seem overcrowded and always welcome when staying in hotel.
We use the executive lounge and we can not fault the layout, service and general welcoming atmosphere. I have used other executive lounges in London but by far this is my favourite. 
Thank you bankside for making us feel welcome and going above and beyond to make every stay special. ",5,2019,08,12
120,Outstanding service!,"I want to especially thank the manager, Jasmin, who helped us with a challenging situation.   Our overnight flight from the US was delayed by 24 hours so our original accommodations were no longer available.   We booked a room at the Hilton London Bankside at the last minute.   Our car service took us to the hotel at 7 am and we literally had nowhere else to go.   Our luggage did not make it on the second flight and we were exhausted.   In addition, we had an eight month old baby in our group.  We sat in the lobby because our room was not ready.   Jasmin was aware of our situation and directed us to the restaurant for breakfast and helped expedite the cleaning of our room so it was available sooner for us.   The crib for the baby was all setup and even had a toy!  As soon as we could get to our room, we all literally fell into bed and caught some much-needed sleep.   I'll always remember Jasmin's kindness and help on our first day in London.   I would recommend this hotel for this reason alone, but it is also within walking distance of great restaurants and shopping. The beds were wonderfully comfortable and the bathrooms spacious and well-appointed.",5,2019,08,12
120,"Lovely room, lovely breakfast, lovely pool, lovely staff","Great location, love this part of London near the Tate, Royal Festival Hall, National Theatre, etc - friendly and helpful staff, great breakfast, nice room, nice pool...will definitely stay here again. Wifi was patchy but didn't bother me enough to mention it.",5,2019,08,12
120,Perfect getaway,We stayed here for a night and it was honestly perfect. The room was so comfy as were the robes. The location was perfect only 5/10 minute walk to the train station and it was way to get around. The staff were extremely friendly ,5,2019,08,11
120,Great decoration,"The DoubleTree brand always tries to be fancy. Here the decoration really works, it felt very classy and contemporary. Rooms are comfy. Guest services were very helpful in resolving a booking issue. Wish the windows opened. ",5,2019,08,11
120,It’s ok but too issues make it only a 3 star,"Let’s start with what went wrong, first at check in when we got to reception they couldn’t find our booking. Not finding a booking can happen but as we had paid for the previous night, on the previous night we phoned the hotel to tell them we couldn’t make it as our train was stuck and there was travel chaos due to a power outage affecting many trains, traffic lights etc (9th August 19). When they found our booking they couldn’t find us a room as we were counted as a no show, so bit of a wait then we got a room on the first floor, we asked if there was a room on a higher floor but nothing was available. The above wouldn’t have mattered but it felt like the staff were blaming us, despite them confirming the record of our call on the previous night. The room key didn’t work so had to be reset and bit noisy at 3am. The rooms are a good size, nice location and could be great.",3,2019,08,11
120,Excellent Location,"The location is by far the best thing about this hotel when compared to others north of the river, being a five minute walk from a tube station on the Jubilee Line offering direct access to both City and Heathrow airports with one change. Not great if you have loads of cases though...

We were allocated a Deluxe room on the seventh floor with views over toward the Tate Gallery, the note / balloons / cake in recognition of a Birthday were greatly appreciated. The rooms are comfortable and well appointed but as before housekeeping need a good shake, loads of dusty surfaces and constant banging of room doors at short intervals as they close behind staff - even on a Sunday morning.

The Executive Lounge has slipped a wee bit, afternoon tea items being recycled into the evening offer and a little repetitive with the cold choices being the same over three nights and hot food presented ‘the same’ for two nights, pakora on night one, frankly vile...

Breakfast is alright but on morning one we were not given Diamond HH à la carte options, being told these were extra by our server which on exit the floor manager confirmed were actually included. Get your staff training sorted. We also watched an Asian girl take the table being set-up for us then allowed to remain at it, she had just decided she preferred that table after visiting the buffet, staff did not move her. Another morning I had to go and get a server to take our order, on my way to get coffee which is normally brought to you. And please, all hotels can you get rid of those piggin’ toast machines we all despise?

I have to say that we were not terribly impressed this visit and it’s by no way our first. On my last stay I did raise concerns we were not recognised at Diamond status, again no suite offered and others were (by their reviews) and assured next stay we’d be looked after, which of course I followed up upon for this stay - also explaining this was a special stay for us. I need not have bothered, will be looking at other options in future but may consider this as a base location if convenient.

Good enough hotel when offered at a good enough price.",4,2019,08,11
120,Great service ,"It’s a very beautiful boutique hotel, I’ve stayed 20 nights in a one bedroom deluxe suite with lounge access , in the beginning there were some mistakes but they solved them all. 
The location is great, it’s a walking distance from beautiful restaurants, Borough market, the shard , London eye and the river Thames. 
The service is perfect and all there staff from the smallest position to the highest management are so nice, friendly and professional. 
I recommend the hotel to all my friends and family. 
I’m sure I’ll come back again.",5,2019,08,10
120,Loved This Hotel,"Hilton Bankside is a homerun. We thoroughly enjoyed our stay. We stayed in a 1 bedroom suite, which was spacious with plenty of room for 2 adults and 2 kids. The sofa bed is very spacious. The suite has 2 tvs and 1 large full bathroom with tub and separate shower and another small wc with toilet and sink. The living room has a nice table/chairs, separate work area and sofa with 2 chairs and cocktail table. Really very spacious. Very nice to have a second toilet when traveling with family. The hotel is new and very clean. A/C works very well. The few snacks and drinks in the mini bar are all free. The design of the hotel is one of the best parts. It's modern, but warm. Our suite included the executive lounge, which is very nice especially if you arrive early in the morning as we did. You will be able to wash up, relax, and enjoy the breakfast while you await your room to be ready. However, other than that, we really didn't use it. The afternoon snacks are ok and if you think you will be at the hotel at that time, definitely take advantage of it. The breakfast is comprehensive and very nice. Everything you want is there. The location is not ideal for the tube or trains, but taxis and Uber are easy and tube station is only a 5-7 minute walk away. There are not a ton of restaurants and cafes around the hotel like in more central London, but there is enough good options. Tate Modern and Borough Market are both very close and you should visit both! I would rate the hotel as far as location a 3.5, but really we did not have any issues at all getting around. The hotel is not 5 star super luxury, but it is certainly 4-5 stars and for a family traveling with young kids, it was perfect in every way.",5,2019,08,09
120,Great Location,"This hotel has an excellent location whether you want to walk the bridges or take public transport. Our room on the 6th floor was quiet, whistle clean and comfortable. Staff are on top of their game...and friendly!",5,2019,08,08
120,So nice hotel,"Nice location, brand new hotel, cool restaurant
It is just 5 min to the train staion and Tate modern on foot!! 
Staffs are very friendly and competent. 
The room was so clean, comportable and big enough. 
",4,2019,08,07
120,Family friendly hotel,"We stayed here as a valentine's treat, but lack of a babysitter meant bringing our toddler with us! We were very impressed with the facilities for families. Our son had a proper cot instead of a travel one and the height off the ground was more what he's used to , ensuring a better sleep for him and us. He also had a little welcome pack which included his own mini bathrobe and some rubber ducks which we brought to the pool. The hotel location is perfect for getting around London easily and we loved the style and feel of the hotel. Fully planning on booking in again soon. Possibly for our tenth wedding anniversary next month",5,2019,08,07
120,Excellent,"Excellent stay --- beautiful quiet room, comfortable bed, in a great location with easy access to transport and walking distance to London Tower, City and Temple.

Breakfast buffet was a bit limited if you have gluten and dairy free dietary requirements.",5,2019,08,06
120,"Fantastic hotel, highly recommend!","Just had a wonderful 4-night stay at this awesome hotel! Beautiful hotel, chic and comfortable rooms, great location, efficient and friendly staff- loved everything about this place... Well done and thank you so much- we had a lovely visit and will see you next time!",5,2019,08,06
120,Amazing hotel & service. Worth every penny.,"Very good hotel naar the city center. Our room was very spacious, modern and nicely cleaned.  The staff is really friendly and always willing to help. Breakfast was superb, especially the good service from Alessia is something we won't forget. We recommend this hotel to everybody that plans to visits Londen.",5,2019,08,05
120,Outstanding Stay & Service,"It is very clear to see why this property has earned the ""Certificate of Excellence""......the property, location, staff, rooms, restaurants and amenities are all stellar!!!!  I traveled to the UK to celebrate my brother's 30th birthday and had an absolutely amazing stay at the Hilton London Bankside. The hotel is within walking distance of Borough Market, The Shard, Tower Bridge, etc. which was very nice and convenient.  In addition, I had several interactions with various staff members; each being patient, professional and accommodating.  Specifically, I had a few questions which were all promptly answered by Reservation Agent Dylan Hieu, Front Desk Receptionist Daniele, was also very profession and resourceful with a few last minute requests that I had and finally, Guest Relations Manager David Twinn, served as an effective person of reference for all of my needs during our stay.  The staff went above and beyond with providing very thoughtful touches and amenities to make my brother's 30th birthday special and memorable.  Thank you ALL for your help, it was so appreciated.  I highly recommend this hotel property for your UK lodging needs.",5,2019,08,05
120,Offsite meeting,"Very modern and stylish hotel used for our offsite meeting.   Super efficient staff  - nothing was too much trouble.   Food served during our meeting was varied and delicious, catering for all food types.   Would recommend.",5,2019,08,05
120,Definitely a cut above most other Hilton properties,"Really classy new hotel. Stylish and super friendly staff. Great rooms, dining etc. Nice location. Close to the action but tucked away. So quiet. The bed was very comfy and a really nice double shower.",5,2019,08,04
120,Amazing,We were very impressed from the moment we entered this Hilton property. Very modern and clean. The rooms are spacious and well designed. Great service! The executive lounge is amazing. Simona provides excellent service with a smile. We will be back for sure!,5,2019,07,31
120,Fabulous Service,"I’d booked the hotel due to its location on the South Bank as an anniversary visit. We rarely visit this side of The Thames and it made a pleasant change. The hotel is perfectly situated for strolls up and down the embankment, fabulous 1st class service and lovely presentation. We were offered complementary Prosecco and were extremely happy to have delivered a surprise anniversary piece of cake 🤗 After a good nights sleep, we were delighted with the range of breakfast goods on offer. We left our bags for collection after more exploring during the day. Definitely be back, we are swimming things too!!",5,2019,07,29
120,Great service shame about the breakfast,"We stayed for a 2 night theatre trip, check in was good with a glass of fizz (very nice touch) All front of house staff were very customer focused.
The room was very clean and very comfortable.
Only let down was breakfast,service very hit and miss both mornings.
Tinned mushrooms really!
Great location.
Would i stay again yes.",4,2019,07,27
120,Hilton London Bankside - OMG,"One of the best.  We come to London quite often and never stayed near Southbank but it was fabulous.  Close to the Tube, Tate Modern, the Shard and Borough Market.  Ate in the Executive lounge and the breakfast room.  The rooms were large by London standards and five star bathrooms.  The big standout here are the well trained people.  The concierges, bell staff and everyone else we encountered were friendly and informative.",5,2019,07,26
120,We will definitely be repeat customers!,"Our family stayed here for two nights in a family suite. We are all in love with this hotel. Our family suite was two adjoining rooms, which gave us plenty of room and two bathrooms. The room was clean and well appointed. Our room was so quiet as well!  The hotel is very family friendly - upon check in, our youngest was told about the fox find around the public spaces. Kids who find all 31 foxes get a special treat!

Staff was helpful!  Our room wasn’t ready upon our early arrival, so they not only stored our luggage, but delivered it directly to our room before we returned. 

The location was also great. Close to so much, yet not right in the middle of all the city commotion. There’s a Tesco and Sainsbury’s next door, as well as a Costa Coffee. We walked to many things, including the Tower of London and Trafalgar Square. 

Our whole family agrees- we will stay here again!!",5,2019,07,24
120,Confirmed: The Best Hilton in London,"In my opinion, obviously. And having been a Diamond Honors member and stayed at multiple Hilton properties in London I have to say this is by far the best. 

It's new, clean and centrally located. We had a standard king room and by London standards even this room was far more spacious than I had anticipated. 

The design of the hotel and the room is gorgeous. And to make it even better, it has some of the largest bathrooms in London as well.

Service was also the best we've experienced at a London Hilton. Melania on front desk was just delightful and went out of her way to get us a room despite the fact we checked in early, and made the whole arrival experience wonderful. Every time we ventured through the hotel we were greeted by staff; housekeeping, engineers, concierge, and management as well.

There's a cute fox theme going on in the hotel as well and the story behind it is even cuter. It's a pity they don't explain it to you but ask one of the friendly staff and I'm sure they'll be delighted to tell you.

We had some minor housekeeping issues during the stay which have been addressed by management separately and really, shouldn't stop you from staying  here.

Overall, our five nights here were outstanding. I'm the GM of a hotel chain (not Hilton) and have been in the business for over 20 years, and I'm quite fussy. So when I say stop shopping around and just book it already I really mean it.",5,2019,07,24
120,Our favorite in London,"We stayed here again.  We stayed 2 non-consecutive nights in order to get credit for 2 stays to maintain Diamond status!  We had a basic room this time both nights because the hotel was full so our upgrade was minimal.  We did get a tub the 2nd night due to our request when checking out the first time.  Also, we got late check-out until 3 pm but actually left just after 1 pm as we did not need the extra time.  The lounge was great as always.  They now have an all female staff in the lounge although one of the managers one evening was male.  Still the same with enough to make a dinner to avoid having to go out and spend money.  Drinks available for 2 1/2 hours with hors d'ouevres for the first 2 hours.  We always do breakfast in the restaurant and are always treated very well.  I usually have an egg white omelet plus a few other goodies.  They could use some darker breads!  We like the location and have found 2 great restaurants nearby which are now on the ""always when we visit London"" list.  1)  Prince of Wales for Fish & Chips and great beer and 2) Laughing Gravy for Sunday roast and maybe more!  We'll be back on our next London visit!",5,2019,07,23
120,Our new favorite in London,"During a 3 wk trip combining business and leisure in May, we stayed here twice...at the beginning and end of our travels.  Although we usually stay at the Mondrian Sea Containers, we wanted to try something new this time, and aside from one rough patch, we were delighted with this decision.   Details follow:

Property & location - well situated in quiet Southbank, the hotel is an easy walk to restaurants, pubs, museums, sites, the Thames...virtually everything is reachable by foot. The building is very pretty inside, with clean lines and a sleek, modern feel. 

Exec Lounge -  We enjoyed breakfast in the lounge daily and overall it was simply fantastic. Spacious,spotless, comfortable and well stocked with a wide assortment of food choices the lounge exceeded our expectations in every way.  The staff members were outstanding, and Rebecca in particular went out of her way to be sure to have a gluten free omelette for me each morning.  Thank you so much!

Gym -  Small and often crowded in the morning, the gym offered decent cardio machines and adequate free weights, but the layout hindered comfortable usage for more than a few people at one time.  The layout needs rethinking. Just ok.  

Bar - We enjoyed relaxing in the bar some evenings with snacks and a drink and found the staff polite and helpful. 

Check-in - For our 1st stay (we were still HH Gold, but turning Diamond during this trip), we were warmly welcomed by Natasha and Melania who personified Hilton Hospitality at it's best.  Exhausted from our overseas flight, we truly appreciated their cheerful demeanor and efficiency in getting us settled into our fabulous, spacious Exec King room, with Lounge access.  With 3 wks of luggage in tow, we were thrilled to find large closet.  Also appreciated was the bigger safe for our camera and devices. Thank you Natasha and Melania!!

2nd stay - We were excited to be returning after such a wonderful 1st experience, and as newly minted Diamond members, but were sadly disappointed by our initial 2nd stay check-in. The gentleman at check-in was disinterested in our return and HH status, instead informing us that the hotel was expecting ""other Diamond members later in the day who would be asking for upgrades"", so nothing was available for today.  Wow.  He also stated the lounge was not an option with the room he was assigning us.  After we pressed him a bit on this, he yielded, but it was awkward and we were frankly offended to have to ask.   The room was tiny, dark and had inadequate closet and safe space, paling in comparison to our stay just 2 wks prior. The next morning we had the good fortune of seeing Natasha at the desk, who was more than happy to move us to a better room, more similar to our previous.  We were so appreciative.  She saved the day and changed our opinion of the experience. 

Overall - Thanks to the kindness and hospitality of most of the staff, we would absolutely stay at Bankside again.  We visit London several times a year and look forward to booking again.",5,2019,07,23
120,"Quiet, luxurious hotel that is great for families in a great location","Our family - 2 Grandparents, 2 parents, 2 kids ages 11 & 8 - went to London for 2 nights  and stayed at this hotel. In short, we had a fantastic experience. My husband and I had a family suite with our 2 kids and it was great - very comfortable, clean, quiet, and everyone slept well. The real bonus for our family was the hotel's executive lounge. I frankly didn't think we would use this amenity for more than just a couple of bottles of water every morning but we actually ate dinner there both nights - relaxed atmosphere and plenty of food! A special thanks to Simona in the lounge who, together with her team, went out of their way to make sure our children were looked after and didn't go hungry!! The location of this hotel is perfect, close to so many attractions and public transport. We are a picky group and no one had anything negative to say about this great hotel. We would stay here again no question. A huge thanks to the Hilton staff, especially Simona and her team in the lounge, for all they did for us!!",5,2019,07,23
120,👏👏👏,My 3 days stay in this hotel was very commendable. The staff were so friendly and accommodating. My room was spacious and very conducive for relaxation. I will definitely come back the next time I visit London.,5,2019,07,22
120,Excellent stay,"An excellent stay, the hotel is perfectly positioned for strolling along the Southbank with easy access to the underground and iconic landmarks. The staff were amazing, the room was well furnished and the bed and pillows were so comfortable. The breakfast was delicious with a huge choice to suit everyone. I would highly recommend staying at the Hilton Bankside and hope we can return soon.",5,2019,07,19
120,Thais and the Staff Were Excellent.,"We arrived supremely jet-lagged after nearly 24 hours of travel. The executive lounge had a full spread of tea, sandwiches, treats, and very comfortable seating with tables, fireplace and t.v. We could not have chosen a better situation to greet us. Speaking of ""greetings,"" the staff here, especially Thais, were spectacular. They are very warm and welcoming, and provide every opportunity to assist you, including the daily ""bubbles"" offered after miles of trekking through London. Our room (a suite) was perfect, with ample room for the boys, and a door to allow the sleepy parents to nod off earlier. The furnishings are so relaxing and modern, and the beds were very comfortable. The location was excellent, as you can quickly get to the walkway along the Thames and to the Tate, The Globe, the Tower of London (an easy and scenic walk), as well as all of the iconic landmarks in between. I loved that it wasn't one of the areas with tons of pubs and a party atmosphere suited for twenty-somethings. (Head to Shoreditch if you are younger and in wish for more nightlife.) I highly recommend this hotel. And a ""hello"" to Thais, who we hope to see again, when we return.",5,2019,07,18
120,"Great Hotel, Friendly Staff, spacious rooms close to station","We had a wonderful family holiday, rooms were spacious and modern and the staff were friendly as well as accommodating. The breakfast has a large selection to choose from. It is located close to Southwalk station on the jubilee line. We will definitely be returning!",5,2019,07,17
120,Modern and very comfortable,Very impressed with this Hilton tucked away just around the corner from the Tate Modern. It’s quite new and the decor reflects that - chunky and modern. The bed was super comfortable and the shower very powerful. Minimalist decor with only a fox head as wall art! I thought the room didn’t have a dressing table mirror but then discovered there was one in the hair dryer box - clever. I didn’t eat there or use the facilities but I will definitely return to do that. One small niggle - the mini bar was quite noisy (only soft drinks in it). I would have switched it off but the plug was concealed. Managed to get a good sleep regardless!,5,2019,07,17
120,Still very new looking in decor!,"Good location or Tate Modern, Borough Market, Golden Hind and more. We stayed in and Executive Room with access to Executive Lounge. The staff in the Executive Lounge worked hard to keep everyone happy, cleaning,tidying, wonderful nibbles and drinks and breakfast was good for buffet. Unfortunately we had really poor sleep due to bed quality! Bathroom was excellent. Room was clean. Would have been wonderful to have somewhere to hang your coats in hallway of room! My charger broke while staying but the young concierge gentleman was very happy to assist. Scored 3 due to restaurant experience - Considering the restaurant was extremely quiet very few tables taken the food was cold on arrival to the table. We didn’t send back but the fries and triple cut chips were disgusting, the chef had obviously had an accident with the salt they we’re inedible. Customers can add salt if they do wish! Tattinger was not chilled properly! Croque Monsieur was excellent but not hot enough, no sirloin steak available had to have rib-eye, which was not great being just about warm. Grilled tomatoes cold. Ice cream lovely quality. The filtered water was very smelly, heavy chlorine smell.
Not a good experience unfortunately.",3,2019,07,16
120,Great Hotel next to The Globe,"Unassuming from the outside, really nice modern hotel on the inside.  Good size rooms, well appointed and very comfy beds & pillows.  Reception and lobby staff welcoming and attentive, only tried restaurant for breakfast but great choice of food, well cooked and well presented.  Cocktail bar very popular in evening with corporate groups, but OK nontheless.  Only downside was the designer tea cups which didn't have handles, so impossible to pick up until the tea was too cold to drink!  Form over function, alas, but in the end a waiter found a mug from the breakfast kitchen, so sorted eventually.  A small negative in a very positive overall experience.  
Great location for The Globe, Tate Modern, and the footbridge over to St Pauls but without the traffic - seriously worth considering as a cheaper alternative to the West End",5,2019,07,15
120,Modern Hotel,"We stay at Hilton Hotels and became members due to the comfort of the beds, pillows and the warm welcome you receive. 
In particular this Hilton Hotel struggles with staff morale. They all seem as though they don’t want to be there. 
The hotel is only 2 years old so it’s modern and clean. 
The breakfast is standard. 
I would give the club room a miss. It’s not your usual Hilton club longe where there are sandwiches, hot food , nibbles and deserts. The bar mainly consists of soft drinks and a couple of nibbles. 
We found the hotel to be a bit far from the main shopping strip Oxford St. ",4,2019,07,15
120,Great Value and location for family stay:),"As a family of four accommodations can get pricey in big cities. Hilton bankside has a deluxe 1 bedroom- which allowed our kids to sleep in their own twin beds separately from us ( sliding door) There was also an extra toilet room ( albeit very small) additional to the main bathroom which was much appreciated.

Room very clean, bathroom with many amenities and shower plus bath, air conditioning worked super well ( we happened to be there the day London hit 95 degrees Fahrenheit) and quiet room on first floor) 

Location was great too. We ended up walking to all the major sites ( tower bridge, London eye, borough market, Shakespeare globe), so we can’t comment on the metro. Some of the restaurants we went to and Buckingham palace were a little far, but then we just used Uber.

The only mild negative is the executive lounge. Not like others that we have been to. There was only one person working every-time we were there and she was running around cleaning the tables, trying to get orders for everyone ( eggs made to order also not made clear since no one seats you ) and there were many tables to care for. The choices for breakfast are not extensive, but were adequate for us). The hot food that was laid out at the buffet wasn’t very hot either. 

Overall, we were happy with our stay and would consider again given the accommodations.",5,2019,07,13
120,Hilton hotel,"The room service at the Hilton London Bankside Hotel has very nice food. The workers at the Hilton are  helpful especially the waiter for room service (Alexsandra Kaner).He is very kind, caring, and smart. The executive lounge truly has great food and beverages. My family and I can’t wait to come back!",5,2019,07,11
120,"Nice hotel, but reception staff needs (more) training.","Nice modern hotel, with good rooms and beds. Excellent bathroom. However, the reception staff needs some training in customer relations. We are Hilton Gold Members, but the reception was a little stand-offish. It could have been a case of adequate language skills, since most of the staff is foreign, but on the two occasions we approached the staff the contact was not very friendly, but rather cold. We were told this Hilton is not related to the other Hiltons in London, so were treated as strangers. No usual upgrade as loyal customers. Despite the fact that the hotel is nice, I don't think we will return again. Not the usual Hilton hospitality.",3,2019,07,11
120,Right choice!,"The Hilton London Bankside is a hidden gem. What was memorable for us, was the sweet aroma, in the lobby and the gorgeous.flowers. . The rooms are are modern, clean and calming.  Hilton London Bankside  is centrally located to many other  locations. The staff was courteous and helpful. There is a bar to socialize, and a separate restaurant where you will find the atmosphere has a nice twist and  tasty food.",5,2019,07,09
120,Great events location,"The Hotel was hosting an awards ceremony that we were attending, therefore we had booked accomadation mainly for convenience. I was very pleasantly surprised at the efficiency of check in and check out, especially as we had 9 rooms booked. They made the process very easy to put everything on one account. This has not always been the case for other hotels in the past. The rooms were also very good and everyone commented on the great nights sleep and the comfy beds. The Ballroom where the event was held was also great and coming in to look over the room was amazing.  ",5,2019,07,08
120,Summer weekend ,"First visit to this property.  Though as a diamond member used to hilton brand. Felt very welcomed & service thought out was excellent.  All staff were very attentive. Room was ok not much of upgrade as hotel was busy. No sauna but pool was good size & relaxing. Lounge had lovely feel & loved the overal style of hotel. Breakfast was very good , loved the pancakes. Location was central & handy for Blackfriars,  i will certainly be back.",5,2019,07,07
120,Overpriced. ,"We stayed last night for my husbands 30th. Room amazing and good location (short walk to Southwark station) 

As we were checking in the guest in front of us was offered free breakfast, complimentary mini bar and lots of others perks - we checked in and were offered nothing! 

Having paid nearly £200 for one night - we expected that to include breakfast. Such a shame as we would have stayed again if this was included as couldn’t fault much else. ",3,2019,07,07
120,Excellent,"A short visit to London for my fiancee’s birthday, this hotel was in a great location, had spacious, clean rooms, provided a great breakfast & lounge area (we had an exec room with lounge access) and a very nice pool (maybe slightly cold).

The spa and gym were just average but ‘done the job’.

Lots of fun decorations up as we visited at Xmas.

Staff were always helpful and polite.

Overall, it was excellent.",5,2019,07,07
120,One bedroom suite ,"I’m not sure if these perks are because I booked the suite but the executive lounge is a great way to save some serious money in London. It includes free breakfast every morning and you can order pancakes and omelettes. Didn’t know that till about the second day. 

There is even free alcohol in the lounge between 5:30-8pm. With some snacks and others, it’s possible to make that dinner!

The pool was great and we used that 3 times. 

Only issue with the hotel is that it’s far from soho where everything is!  Close to Padella for pasta and borough market but that’s about it. Kinda out of the way so you pay for it with cab fares. ",5,2019,07,04
120,Exceptional Customer Service,We arrived after 15 hpurs of travel and the experience has been wonderful. From the bellhop to the frint desk team to the RoomServixe manager Corina and our service attendant Alevsandae Kamer totally went beyond expectations to make our first experience heree in London comfortable. They went down the street to find the beverage of choice for my daughter and I and their chef was so accommodating to address my food allergies which are complex. Rooms are well appointed with a contemporary feel and cleaned very well... my IG handle is Ms Particular so you get it. Great location for those who like to walk a little. very excited for the rest of our stay here.,5,2019,07,04
120,"Great hotel, great place","Authough only staying for one night, I found the hotel was exceptional. The bed was incredibly comfortable and the room was very nice and stylish. In my opinion the best feature of the hotel was the amazing staff, especially Alexander who delivered items to my room always with a smile on his face and  was very friendly and helpful. I would love to thank him and all the staff who made my stay so fantastic.",5,2019,07,03

120,Our favorite hotel ,This is the best hotel we’ve ever stayed at. We’ve stayed here numerous times and there has never been a time that it didn’t feel like home. Especially thankful for Juan Vasquez in the dining room and Andrei in the bar. Spectacular service! ,5,2019,07,02
120,"Great Service, great people","My stay at Hilton Bankside was great. I was served by Mr. Juan Vasquez who was very professional and he provided best service experience. Everyone was very friendly and welcoming, doing their best to provide best standard service.",5,2019,07,01
120,Great Stay at Central London Hotel,"Fantastic stay at this central London hotel, from the moment we checked in, to the very courteous reception team, the complimentary glass of Prosecco, and to cap off the initial welcome, the lovely upgrade due to being a member of the really good Hilton loyalty scheme.

Room was 1st class, in the evening went to the Club lounge, first class service, canapés and drinks well received, a very relaxing lounge, quite and well organised, a credit to the members of staff on duty who were kept very busy throughout the eraly evening

Then supper in the main restaurant, a revelation, good food, (steak was EXCELLANT), really good service and above all, value for money

Breakfast - the piece de resistance, the Egg Florentine, cooked to order, had it on both days, would probably go back just for this - suitably looked after by TIMO who has just the right interaction required to become a first class waiter in anybody's restaurant - special thanks to Timo.

GREAT STAY - will be back in the very near future",5,2019,07,01
120,Outstanding ,"I often stay at Hilton for work and this is by far one of the best I have ever stayed at. I thought it must be brand new but it was built in 2015. Very tastefully decorated. Very welcoming staff. Superb choice of cold and hot items at Breakfast in the OXBO restaurant. I enjoyed freshly prepared waffles two days running. One morning I popped down to Breakfast and put the “Refresh my room” sign out. When I returned 30 minutes later my room had been cleaned. Large bathroom which has speakers so you can still hear the TV. I also really enjoyed the swimming pool (it was one of the reasons I picked this over another Hilton) and the gym looked good to. Excellent location, just behind the Tate Modern and only 5 minutes walk to Southwark tube station (and about 12 minutes to London Bridge in the opposite direction). I would definitely stay here again. ",5,2019,06,30
120,Great discovery,"Situated in a nice district, not too far from City ceter , this hotel is highly confortable. Very modern, it keeps charm of old taverns in his restaurant with nice décoration of old time. Good service everywhere. A very pleasant stay dit tout the buste of touristic par ces.",4,2019,06,30
120,Great contemporary hotel in London,"After staying at many Hilton properties, this is one of my favorites.  Not too big, but it has great restaurants and Executive Lounge. The staff here is excellent, especially in the Executive Lounge. It’s about 2 blocks from the Southwark Underground Station and close to Waterloo Station, perfect for a few days before a cruise from Southampton (10 pounds by taxi).  Highly recommended for a stay in London.",5,2019,06,29
120,Good service and nice location,"This is a typical Hilton, with good service and friendly staff.

If comparing with the other Hilton property I stayed after this (the other one is located closer to my business trip venue), this one is much better maintained (which implies good management), got good facilities (both gym and pool onsite), friendly service, clean and spacious room. ",5,2019,06,24
120,We love the Hilton at Bankside...,"There is nothing we can fault with this particular Hilton. It is our second stay here although we have stayed in Brighton and Bath Hilton’s too. 

This is head and shoulders above the other two. The staff are brilliant, friendly and endlessly helpful. The bar was great and the breakfast simply the best. 

But the best thing about the Hilton Bankside is the beds. They are simply the best we have slept in anywhere in the world. We were so impressed we’re thinking about buying one for our home. We had the best and most comfortable sleep in a long time. 

We will be back for sure! 😊",5,2019,06,24
120,perfect rooms,"My friend & I stayed at this Hilton location for 1 night, for the tail end of our summer euro trip. It was the perfect location to finish at. After spending 10 days hopping the greek isles, we needed a stay in a fully appointed room. The room was beautiful and comfortable. We LOVED the down comforters, and want them for ourselves at home. My only complaint is that the wifi could only be used by 1 device which was really weird- especially since we were 2 people from out of the country and both needed wifi.",4,2019,06,23
120,Solid Hilton in Good Location,"One of the Hilton’s best hotels in central London.
All staff were helpful and competent and hotel seemed very new and clean with nice decor. Also enjoyed the bar area which has a decent Happy Hour.
Recommend and would stay again.",4,2019,06,23
120,Wonderful Experience,"Our stay was wonderful, the hotel beautiful and clean and the staff was really helpful. Especially that young man in reception - Panos, made sure our check-in was smooth and explained all the benefits. Alexandros and Giota from Oxbo helped us choose something for our special occasion and we couldn't be more grateful. More hotels should take an example from this Hilton and these employees! We'll definitely come back soon!",5,2019,06,23
120,"Superb location, great staff ","We really enjoyed our stay at Bankside. The hotel is beautiful and location just great - breakfast was amazing although a bit pricey, there are actually lots of nice places for breakfast around the area. Our only downside was that we got a disabled-friendly room (which we hadn’t booked and were not notified at check-in), I’m sure it’s great if you need it but for us all the safety gear (alarm strings and such) were a little odd. Not sure if that was the reason why there was no wall or curtain in the shower which meant that the whole bathroom got wet. Anyhow, a very positive experience and super friendly staff especially at breakfast! And great views! ",5,2019,06,23
120,Week at the Hilton London Bankside,I had a wonderful stay at the Hilton London Bankside. The staff was very polite and helpful. In particular the people who brought me my breakfast were great and made my stay very pleasant. Room was clean and modern. The bar made great drinks and the food was very nice.,5,2019,06,23
120,Aleksandar was Great ! Super friendly and efficient!,"We had a wonderful stay at Hilton Bankside! I stayed with my Aunty and uncle and everything from service to food was great. The suite was clean and spacious. 

Aleksansar in particular was very polite , professional and considerate. You’d be lucky to him serve you! ",5,2019,06,22
120,Best hotel in Europe,"This hotel does everything right. Warm and friendly staff, clean and comfortable rooms and a great location makes this the best place to stay in London. Price represented good value compared to other alternatives. ",5,2019,06,20
120,Beautiful hotel,Great hotel not far from the tube station. Friendly efficient staff. We started our honeymoon here and they gave us a little surprise dessert in the room to mark the special occasion. Room was beautiful with a great view of the Shard. We would definitely stay here again. ,5,2019,06,19
120,A great stay,"This was our second stay and we were made to feel especially welcome.  Hilton Bankside exceeds in hospitality, generosity and comfort, other hotels weave stayed in, sometimes at a higher price.  The staff are their greatest asset  ",5,2019,06,18
120,Perfect,"We really couldn't fault this place. Perfect in every way. We had originally booked the Waldorf Hilton but after our terrible experience there we decided to book this hotel instead. From the moment we arrived at Hilton Bankside, they made us feel special and everything was very efficient. There are 4-5 check in desks, which is a great idea so it didn't take long. The room was big, modern, clean and we loved the fantastic shower! Overseas guests may not be familiar with this part of town but it has recently had a face lift and there are plenty of fab bars, cafes and restaurants nearby. We are so happy we have somewhere to stay next time we are in London because we will be booking this hotel again for sure!",5,2019,06,16
120,"Outstanding Service, excellent location","6 night stay with husband on vacation.  Staff provided high level of service with a smile, too many to remember all their names.  Carla in reception wonderful giving us ideas of what to do and in general conversation about UK culture. Adolfo and executive lounge staff treated us with warm hospitality and great attention. Excellent amenities in executive lounge. Coffee machine makes the full variety of coffee drinks (espresso, Americano, cappuccino, latte, etc) with fresh ground regular or decaf coffee beans.  Real treat for a coffee lover who must limit caffeine intake for health reasons as most other hotels only offer packets of disgusting instant decaf coffee.  Stayed in standard deluxe room on the 4th floor without much of a view which seems to be the case for many/most rooms here.  That was not an issue for us on this trip as the weather was fantastic and we did not spend much time in the room.  Comfortable beds with removable pad that can be taken for firmer mattress.  Surprise treats in our room on several occasions were delightful. Small bag of freshly made popcorn on arrival and house made granola with the recipe the evening before departure. Granola with yogurt was a breakfast favorite.  One evening gin from the local distillery with a bucket of ice, glasses and a bottle of tonic waiting in our room; I suspect this may have been arranged by Carla. Perfect location for exploring London.  Multiple tube stations nearby.  Southwark station to Heathrow with only one change. ",5,2019,06,14
120,Disappointed guest,"This is my second stay at the hotel this year. Stayed in Jan and June, in March stayed in Marriott Canary Wharf.
I’ve decided to return to Hilton BANKSIDE for few reasons.
1. Efficient and friendly staff
2. One of the best lounge staff
3. Very comfortable room
4. Great location to my meetings in central London and Canary Wharf as well as access to various areas for great food

I don’t usually write too many comments, but I will make one for BANKSIDE. Might be bit picky, but I stay in many hotels around the world and can’t help to compare my experiences. 

Pros:
1. Great friendly lounge staff(Elizabeth was great)
2. Still love the location and access to metro.
3. Comfortable room(one bdm layout was not my favorite, but still bed was very comfortable with 1.5 bathroom was very convenient). Although Tom could use bit more lighting
4. OXBO food improved a lot and tasty.

Misses:
1. During the check in process, front desk person did’t know I was returning guest. I wanted to check to see what kind of room I had it in Jan, but she couldn’t find the record. Even the little desert left in the room with a card simply stated thank you for staying with Hilton BANKSIDE. Other hotels I’ve stayed  in London or else where in the world, they always state “welcome back” in person during the check in and usually in the room with a little comments.
Not a huge problem, but little personal touch is always appreciated. 
2. I assumed hotel was very busy this week. As a diamond status member, I received zero benefits such as room upgrade. My one bdm suit came with the lounge access which diamond status guest already had access.
3. Housekeeping was inconsistent. Great job in cleaning the room, but time for cleaning or turndown was very inconsistent. 
4. Room services was most disappointing. I ordered salad and Cod dish. Salad was over drenched with dressing which made it very soggy(still tasty but texture was off). Cod was over cooked and burnt. Had difficulty cutting even with a knife since beading became very hard. Even the chips were hard to eat. Both over cooked and I believe chips were cooked while back and left in the heat for too long.
I would not order room service again.

Overall some misses, although I may try other hotels in July and maybe central London, I would still recommend the hotel due to location.
",3,2019,06,14
120,Excellent Hotel,"We enjoyed our 3 night stay at this Hilton. It has a great location near metro stations and various tourist attractions. Ubers and taxis can easily find as well. Note: if you plan to take a cab from Heathrow, it’s about $100. An Uber to Gatwick is also about $100 (at 6am). 

Beautiful lobby with several people willing to assist at a moments notice. Checkin was pretty easy. 

I think we had a standard room. Good size bed for 2 adults. Nice size bathroom. Only knocks were the lack of drawer space (relies heavily on space in a closet) and the hair dryer provided had a 3 prong plug while the bathroom outlet was 2 prong. Not major deals. Shower had great pressure and bathroom counter had a good amount of space. 

The breakfast buffet was excellent. Plenty of options for all diets (or lack of one haha). 

I would stay here again should I find myself in London again. 

",5,2019,06,14
120,Wonderful staff and service!,"In this hotel we were part of the executive lounge which had breakfast, tea time, and lounge time/ dinner . There were three specific staff members that reallt out do themselves! They were: Elisabet Alcazar, Silvia Bude, and Adolfo Quevedo. All three of them were very welcoming and sweet plus had excellent customer service! They were very attentive to our needs and concerned about our well beings. They went out of their way to make my brother a whole new meal just because he couldn’t eat what was being served because of an allergy. They all made us feel at home with their wonderful attitude towards us and their desire to work. This made the perfect London experience!",5,2019,06,14
120,Great Location for the Shard and Borough Market,"We had two very comfortable nights in an executive room and must say that the staff were all very friendly and helpful. 
The location was perfect for the area we wanted to visit and we were able to walk to most destinations. 
The executive lounge was really well staffed and we found our stay at this Hilton a very positive experience.",4,2019,06,13
120,Fabulous Mixologist at the Distillery Bar,"While at the Hilton London Bankside if you enjoy a properly made cocktail you must visit the Distillery Bar and ask for Augusto Stach.
Augusto is a mixologist who will present you with a fabulous version of any cocktail you enjoy. He can take a simple drink like the Old Fashion and take to a new level.
His martinis are some of the best I have ever had.

Please do yourself a favor and check out Augusto at the Distillery Bar.",5,2019,06,12
120,London Vacation,"We stayed six nights at the Hilton Bankside and had a great time.  The location was a nice surprise, a little different feel from the other areas we’ve stayed in London but very nice.    The executive lounge was great, big thanks to Silvia who helped us every night and was always very polite and attentive for us.",5,2019,06,12
120,Fabulous ,"We stayed for only one night but everything was great. We had an executive room which was clean, spacious and comfortable. Upon arrival at check-in the lady explained about the perks of having the executive room to us which was helpful especially knowing that the bits in the mini fridge was all complementary and use of the lounge was included too. The lounge was amazing it was serving afternoon tea which we really enjoyed and all drinks were included! The pool is a reasonably good size and a good temperature and was very quiet, the jacuzzi is joined to the pool so it's a bit cold for a jacuzzi which was a shame. The duvet was a bit heavy for the time of year but the air conditioning can be turned down to help with that. Breakfast was beautiful well laid out and a great variety of things to have best we've had in the UK! I was even asked if I wanted my fried eggs sunny side up or hard yolk. All the staff were very helpful and polite and we've booked to come back for new year's eve! ",5,2019,06,11
120,No surprise - which is also a good thing ! ,"Travelled thee for work - they had to accommodate large group, and they do know how to handle it
Ideally located if you have business at Bankside...  
Not much of a surprise ... pleasant, clean and spacious rooms
Buffet-type breakfast with some nice choice of eggs, pancakes etc ...
Pricey ... but very decent professional trips hotel 
",4,2019,06,11
120,Great Hotel,"We booked a weekend away in London and wasn't sure where to stay. There is so many areas and so many hotels to choose from. We'd never stayed around Southwark and Bankside and the area looked nice, suited our needs and then we found a few hotels that we could stay out. In the end i opted for the Hilton.

Reviews and photos of the hotel looked great. It was an easy walk from Southwark tube station too, and a short walk to Bankside.

Our trip involved arriving early in London, and leaving late, so i emailed the hotel who pleasantly promptly replied that this was not an issue. If our Room was ready in the morning then we could check in, if not we could leave our luggage with them.

We arrived at around 10:30am, and went to check in. It was early so we wasn't expecting our room to be ready which it wasn't. The staff were friendly and pleasant and stored our bags for us. 

We returned to the hotel in the evening to check in, which was an easy process. They had already arranged for our luggage to be in our room when we returned which was great. Nice little touch.

Entering the room, the room was large, we loved the decor of the room. Simple and modern.

The bed was huge and we had a great sleep in it. The view wasn't much, it looked out onto a brick wall that was opposite, so not much of a view, but that said, it was evening time so we would have just ended up closing the curtains eventually anyway. The room had everything we needed, tea and coffee making facilities, a fridge with free water in thee for you, and to keep your own things cold, hair dryer, iron and ironing board, safe, and bathrobes & slippers to use which was another nice touch.

The bathroom, had a shower, but no bath.The shower area was great, especially the rain fall head. That was large and a good amount of water came out of it. The towels were nice and soft.

There was a turn down service as house keeping arrived in our room when we were getting ready to go out for the night which was also another nice touch.

We ate breakfast in their restaurant which was great. Food was really good, and we would have liked to have had diner there, but we didn't have time to fit that restaurant in. So maybe another time.

There is also a bar, which was pretty cool. service in there was equally as good.

Out of all the hotels i've ever stayed in, i'd have to stay this is probably one of the best i've stayed in. Lovely hotel with great staff, and all the little things add up that makes you feel special no matter what type of room you are staying in or for how long.",5,2019,06,11
120,great London value in excellent location,The lobby area was very inviting and nicely furnished. They have a really good restaurant onsite and bar as well. Staff were all very friendly and accomodating. Easy access on foot to many of the most important and famous sites of London. The room was modern and clean with very comfortable bed. Overall it hits the mark for Hilton standards and the value can't be beat.,5,2019,06,10
120,A level of service rarely experienced!,"A rather tardy review but the excellent service received across the board at the Bankside Hilton during our stay in March has stuck in my mind. A special mention must go to the bar manager ( sorry I have forgotten his name) but he was great with us as guests and had a great team of warm and motivated staff!! Fantastic cocktails too! Room was amazing,  a great size for Central London, and bed so very comfortable! Will most definitely stay again!",5,2019,06,09
120,A great stay,"Lovely room, food and staff. Nice and clean. Modern tasteful decor. The bed was so comfortable it was like sleeping on a cloud ! Was given an upgrade to executive lounge for joining the Hilton honours programme which was a lovely surprise. The breakfast was nice and had a varied menu. I was also offered a free glass of Prosecco on arrival !",5,2019,06,07
120,Great hotel,"Very friendly staff, great location, modern yet warm. A good basecamp in London for stressy business trips. Once again worth to mention: staff is extremely helpful and a special mention for Kire (OXBO resto) for his friendliness and help.",5,2019,06,05
120,Great Hotel in a Great Location,"My wife and I spent our wedding anniversary here. On arrival we were offered champagne at check-in and our room was available immediately. The hotel is modern (only three years old),   contemporary and features the 'Bankside Fox' throughout. The room was spacious with comfortable seating and bedding. The bathroom was large and had a very large walk-in shower. 
The staff at this hotel are amazing, no grumpy faces here, all smiles and cheery. The guys who run the bar know how to entertain and above all mix the perfect cocktail. Top marks all round. We normally stay at the Park Lane, but I think we'll be switching to Bankside from now on",5,2019,06,04
120,If only every Hilton was this nice,Well this is what a Hilton should be like. The staff was helpful and the maid service was actually excellent. The showers are new and the breakfast selection was great. I never had an issue with noise and the rooms feel cozy with in room tea and cookies for coming 'home' in the afternoon. There are few rooms with a view but the hotel is still worth it and is easy to get to via train or underground. ,5,2019,06,02
120,Great location and service,"My husband and I stayed at this hotel for 3 nights.  The location is excellent, near the Tube plus close to many restaurants and stores including the Borough Market.  We had a King Executive room and were able to use the lounge on the main floor for breakfast and afternoon snacks and spirits.  The food was self-serve with a good variety of items - and kept spotlessly clean by the lounge staff.  Coffee, bottles of water and soda was available at all times.  Having the lounge to escape to at the end of the day was very nice - consider booking an Executive room for this perk.

Our room was large and quiet (we asked for a room away from the lifts) but had no view.  The walls were a dark paneling and the closets were a little small - one closet had shelving in the absence of drawers for your clothing.  The room and bathroom were clean and well kept by housekeeping.

Will end this with a shout-out to the very nice staff from the bellhops to the teams at the front desk and the lounge.  Thanks for always greeting us with a smile.",5,2019,06,02
120,A satisfied stay.,"Our stay was for 7 nights and with a rather complicated booking, it was broken down to 6 separated booking.

I was very happy Hilton Bankside able to connect the bookings together and we able to stay in one room thru out.

Front desk was helpful, we arrived early and was able to rest in the executive lounge area till our room got ready.

Room is good size, free minibar, nice comfy beds.

We had breakfast in the lounge everyday and for several days we utilized the open bar there in the evening too, service was great.

",5,2019,06,01
120,Excellent stay,"We stayed here last sunday evening.  We booked a standard room but decided to upgrade on checkin into a deluxe room including executive lounge access for a nominal amount.

Our room wasn't ready so they gave us a glass of prosecco while we waited.  This is a very busy hotel and reception was rather busy with lots of people checking in.  We were shown to the executive lounge as we had to wait a little longer.  The executive lounge at this Hilton is fantastic.  Lovely lounge with friendly service.  Afternoon tea served from 3pm was cakes and sandwiches with tea.  Quite a good offering.  
The evening service was from 5.30 and offer lots of alcoholic drinks including Cava and some canapes.
The room was big and comfortable with a nice view of the Shard.  Great aircon and comfortable bed.  There is a small swimming pool on the 2nd level basement which was great for a swim.  It wasnt busy when we went there at 4pm on the Sunday.  Service and food at Oxbo can be hit and miss.  This time it was a miss. Service wasnt great and the food didnt stand out.
Adequate breakfast at the lounge in the morning.  We overall enjoyed our stay here and would stay again.  My recommendation is try to get a room with lounge access or ask for an upgrade upon checkin.",5,2019,05,30
120,Excellent Service Hilton Bankside,"Can’t fault this Hilton. I am always well looked after by the The Front Desk and Concierge. The team provide an faultless service. 

The rooms are furnished and cleaned to a high standard and the breakfast variety and quality is excellent.",5,2019,05,29
120,AMAZING!!,Family trip to London and the Hilton Bankside was perfect!  Great Location! Incredible staff! We arrived early in the morning from a long flight and they went out of their way to ensure that they get a room ready for us and they did. The concierge staff was very helpful.  The management and staff at the Distillery Bar were very nice. Special shout out to Adolfo at the Executive Lounge! My family and I appreciated everything especially the dessert tray which was a an incredible treat. Highly Recommend this Hotel.,5,2019,05,28
120,This time I am staying somewhere else,"I have stayed at this hotel for 3 nights each in September 2018, December 2018, and February 2019 (9 nights total). As a Hilton Diamond Member each time I inquired about an upgrade I always received an excuse such as they have one but it won’t be ready for several hours, or they have one for tomorrow night but not tonight should I wish to move rooms. The deluxe room is a joke in that they offer you a “free mini bar” inclusive of some off brand cola and one or two other beverage. The first time it wasn’t stocked leading me to learn that the deluxe room is the same as the regular one in all aspects except the 3 bottles. The rooms either face a wall of other rooms or a wall yet I have had staff tell me the deluxe room has an upgraded view. Room service on several occasions wasn’t completed after requests and never at a normal morning hour. In addition they put some ridiculous hold on your credit card beyond the cost of the room and you need to remind them to remove it at checkout on the spot of it will be there for days after. This is a hotel that thinks it’s better than it is. 

I am writing this review to let the hotel know that I will in London again for 4 nights this time in June and I will be giving my loyalty business to another hotel. Establishments don’t realize they lost business until you tell them.",3,2019,05,27
120,A very rare case of perfection,"We arrived at the hotel and received a very warm reception and were also very impressed with the surroundings.  The check-in was very smooth and we were generally impressed with the decor and cleanliness throughout the hotel.

The room was impressive, with every little detail thought through, and the little things like the bed turning down service were outstanding.

The location was perfect for exploring the South Bank and many other areas.

Overall outstanding.",5,2019,05,27
120,Fantastic clean and modern hotel in central London,"I've stayed at this Hilton a couple of times now, I've not been disappointed so far.

- Friendly and helpful staff
- Modern hotel
- Really comfortable bed and bedding
- Clean
- Great bar and restaurant
- Good gym and pool facilities

This particular property is a really superb example of the Hilton brand, as a honors member I would suggest this property be used as a model for other London Hilton hotels that are in much need of updating.",5,2019,05,27
120,Truly not blown away. Staff need educating,"So trip advisors, I normally don’t leave a review unless I’ve been in a property at least twice but on this occasion, I felt I needed to.

I’m a Hilton honour diamond member however I always put my review as another banded member. I see hotels from all ways. 

Prior to arrival, I had phoned the hotel to see if there was a paid upgrade available as the Hilton app simply kept showing none available yet I knew, there was higher room grades available. The reservations manager for Hilton Bankside was very rude, mislead Hilton guest services and closed down my complaint against her, even though I didn’t consider the matter closed which is simply ludicrous behaviour.  

On the day of arrival, I simply wanted to proceed to my room so I did an app check in for digital key. To my surprise, I had been upgraded to a one bed suite but not the biggest I’ve experienced. 

So ladies and gentlemen you’d pay around £300 for this suite. Is it designed in a modern. Way, yes. Is it designed well, no. I’m very much use to having a wardrobe inside the bedroom and just felt the hotel designers had gone too far. Minor issues in the en—suite shower room. The Bose speakers was distorted and not working correctly plus the shower kept leaking water onto the tiles, luckily I had spare towels to hand. The big thing is like to mention is the bed is very comfy and I certainly wanted to sleep in it longer. 

So I experienced the OBXO Bankside and words fail me. Simple Atrocious! I was accompanied on my stay with someone special. My guest has got aspergers so planning ahead is fundamentally a top priority.  On arrival to the Bankside I asked the staff when the quieter time is, apparently 9pm on a Friday night. We got to the OXBO  just after and I informed the OXBO greeter of his condition,  requested a quite table away from the crowds and this was done. Staff seemed more attentive to setting up for breakfast rather than concentrating on guests.  Considering the restaurant doesn’t close until 11pm, you’d think this might be too early! So we kept our order simple as Quite frankly, the menu does not match a 5* hotel. The choice is basic and overpriced for the portion sizes which we never stayed to eat. The lights kept going up and down which caused my guest discomfort. When we spoke to the waitress, she didn’t seemed concerned at all. Our mains arrived before our starter rolls which upset my guests routine. When the plates arrived, they was tiny as anything and my partner/ guest felt the plates and was stone cold. At this point we decided to get up, walk out and quickly devise a second plan, wagamama! By the way ladies & gentleman, this restaurant is 2 mins walk from the Hilton Bankside and the food is so much better. 

Executive lounge: this lounge is nice and cosy in appearance. The staff however are more concentrated on playing candy crush on their phone and leaning. Oh, be aware the lounge only serves alcoholic beverages until 8pm, unlike other major Hilton’s of 9pm. Also, they set up breakfast early in the lounge. Our arrival time was 850pm.  Breakfast in the lounge is ok, nothing amazing. We only went in to have a morning read of the newspaper, a coffee and pastry before trying OXBO breakfast. 

OXBO BREAKFAST.  Ok. I cannot fault the range of products on offer.  If you pay to have breakfast here, you’ll certainly be full for the majority of the day.  Only negative again, asked staff for a quite table with my partner/ guest and this was accommodated. Half way through our breakfast, the music got louder and a staff member decided to move tables around us, causing unnecessary flair ups with my partners aspergers. 

 
The thing I want to draw attention to, is not every disability is visible. Some people with a disability don’t see it as a disability, just something which is apart of them. When you inform hotel staff prior to arriving in a restaurant, you’d like to think they would be mindful of this. When you explain to staff briefly what aspergers is and what things can affect flair ups, you’d hope you would be accommodated slightly more however, this simply isn’t the case.  I thought the staff in the OXBO restaurant are externally arrogant, not educated and simply do not communicate between themselves.  I honestly wanted to invite all the staff to my hotel suite and just educate them on our experiences. 

Hilton Honors Counter: simply non-existent. Even on check out, no formalities of have a nice day, or thank you for being a diamond member, see you soon again. Just ok, bye. 

My stay wasn’t completely bad. I have to give credit to Monica who works in reservations. She provided much insight to the hotel layout and I’m planning my nephews birthday (was planning on booking the penthouse suite with 3 rooms, won’t now!), she gave great insight. 

The guest relations manager on nights duty. She was a lovely Italian lady who had compassion. She took on board everything we said, and even listened attentively at my partner who gave wealth of information. 

Lastly, I have been looking forward to this stay considering the “hype” around this hotel and its venues. If you are young, trendy and up for it party type person, this place is for you.  It’s loud, it’s bold and designed with a quirky view point. If I had been taking my mother here, I’d book Conrad or Waldorf London venues. 

For anyone who has got a disability that is not visible, stay well clear. Staff are not compassionate and not educated.

120,A great experience ,Have stayed in many hotels in London but reckon this is the best so far. Rooms very well appointed and the service was very welcoming and attentive. Usual eye watering prices for breakfast but luckily it was included in our deal and I must say it was exceptional; no rubber bullet scrambled eggs here! I’d come back everytime,5,2019,05,19

120,Customer Service ,"We had a lovely stay at the Hilton London Bankside .  The staff couldn’t have been more helpful .

They swooped on us the moment we entered the foyer and took our heavy bags . As we had arrived about an hour before check in time they stored them away securely and then brought them up to our room .

The housekeeping service was efficient and they would check that you had enough supplies and gave additional water on request .

The location was superb . Walking distance to London Bridge , Borough Market , River Thames, London Eye and the Tate Modern.

Tower of London was about an hour away on foot.

Overall we had a lovely first visit to London and enjoyed our stay .",4,2019,05,19
120,Great place to stay in London,"This is the second time my wife and I stayed at the Hilton Bankside. It is in a great location. It is a 5 minute walk from the Southwark tube. The staff is friendly and helpful. They have turndown service in the evening. As a diamond Hilton Honors member we had access to the executive lounge where they have breakfast in the morning, tea in the afternoon and cocktails in the evening. We are going to be back in London at the end of August and I expect we will stay there again.",5,2019,05,18
120,So much to praise,"From the moment we arrived you knew it would be a fantastic stay, and we were not mistaken.  There is room for improvement but I really enjoyed the stay and Bankside London Hilton will now be my first choice Hotel when I stay in London.

We used valet parking, which was so easy but the spaces are limited and you cannot reserve.  We simply pulled up, our bags were unloaded for us and the car driven away to be parked.  After what is often a stressful drive through London the use of Valet parking is a stressfree zone.

We were allocated our rooms and our bags were delivered to our rooms seamlessly delivered without knowing they were even there.  

We had used Hilton Honors points for the rooms, and allocation can sometimes be questionable but not here the rooms were lovely and we even had our own Bankside Fox on the wall complete with shadow!

This hotel offers a turn down service, slightly embarrassing on my part, as i had left the room with clothes and make up everywhere as I was running late for dinner but they worked nicely around all my disorganized chaos and completed their task.

We had planned drinks and lunch in the bar which proved a challenge in terms of a language barrier.  I speak a little French but I believe our server was Spanish which my French was of little use!  I asked for any dressing ingredients to the Clarkes Salad, for which I was instructed on a club sandwich.  My second attempt served of no better use and I got provided the ingredients listed in the menu.  I was I will confess starting to loose my patience a little, and my third request was for the allergy menu.  The return advice was the salad had cheese.  I gave up!  My guests had drinks and lunch I simply had drink.

We did not eat dinner here, we had reservations for a Threatre Package at The Savoy Grill however, I feel we missed out as the menu looked amazing and if the service at Breakfast was anything to go by it deserved a visit.

Breakfast was a delight, best breakfast I have had in a long long time and the service by Dylan was perfection.  Customer service levels were exceptional.

Overall this hotel deserves a visit, if you are considering a stay do not hesitate and book it will not disappoint.",4,2019,05,17
120,"Premier, High Quality Aesthetics and Overall Great Service - But Room for Improvement","Upon arriving to Hilton Bankside I was greeted and assisted by the doorman. I was directed to the check in counter and helped quite promptly and professionally. My first impression of the place was ""Wow!"" This place has an awesome look to it inside. Very unique, very elegant, very detailed, very classy. I was upgraded to a room with free (non-alcoholic) drinks from the minifridge with my Gold status. Pleasant surprise given my full day so far of travels.

The first thing I needed after a 5 hour train ride from Edinburgh was a drink. So I proceeded to the bar (The Distillery). There I was served very quickly and professionally by the bar staff. They poored me a great Gin drink (they have 100 different gins here - so of course I chose Hendricks). I asked if walking to Buckingham palace was do-able, and after a quick laugh, we agreed it was ambitious yes, but quite possible. So off I went. 

I walked all the way to Buckingham palace, catching most of the sights along the way. From the Palace, I walked around the Park to Trifalgar square, downed a quick pint at Sherlock Holmes pub, and made my way back to the hotel. All in all, the walk took a good two hours. I recommend it highly if you're bored or looking to get your day's steps in. I even passed by the BAFTA award red carpet on the way home. 

Upon arriving back at the hotel, I was in the mood for another drink. Here is where the stay took a bad turn. The bar staff at this time of the evening was much more inattentive, slow, and pretty uninterested in helping me (not sure about other customers). It took forever to get a drink, I may have had to repeat my order to different staff members. The thing that really started to upset me at this point was their interesting policy that you cannot order restaurant food at the bar. There are literally three menus at this hotel: The restaurant menu, the bar food menu, and the room service menu. I was told by the bar manager that because many people would order the restaurant food from the bar area, the bar was losing its vibe and causing operational issues for the restaurant kitchen. So they changed their policy. I'm here to tell you (and I told them) that I would have netted them a nice size dinner, drinks, and desert from the restaurant if they would have allowed it (I was a solo traveler, so I was not in the mood to sit by myself in the restaurant). It was hard to even convince the bar staff to provide a copy of the restaurant menu so I could review and decide if I wanted to walk 20 yards over to the restaurant. Ultimately I decided to retire to my room and order room service: which apparently caters to tourists, because the choices were not nearly as appetizing as the full food menu offered by Oxbo, the restaurant. I got a pretty poor take on fish and chips and a decent dessert and called it a night. I was pretty disappointed, with the food - and with the hotel's bizarre food policy. 

Ok, for as disappointed as I was with the bar situation and food options at HLB, the room was awesome. Perfect bed, great finishes throughout, nice art, lovely spacious bathroom, nice television. pretty much everything you could ask for. 

The next morning, before departing for Heathrow, I returned to the bar for one last coffee and a glass of water, against my better judgment. Well, again, the same bar mnager was there to NOT pay attention to me hardly at all, take my coffee order twice before actually returning with one. I don't know if this service was a result of me being alone, or whether the place just runs very lacadasically. I couldn't tell if other people were being paid more attention to. Frankly, I didn't care and it didn't matter. I was done with ""The Distillery"". 

All in all, I think this hotel is pretty awesome. Everyone besides a select couple staff members were more than helpful and courteous. The location is pretty dang good, and the look and feel of the place is something Hilton should be very proud of. I would just say that my experience with ""The Distillery"" unfortunately left me with a bad taste. If someone were to ask me if I would stay again, I would likely say yes, but I would go elsewhere for food and drinks.",4,2019,05,16
120,"Perfectly Located, Perfect Staff","Very proper with a doorman to assist you in and out of the hotel.  Concierge services were spot on.  They were able to place us in our room well before the 3:00 check in time, which allowed us to begin our exploring early.  The concierge also assisted us to getting to our train on the last day.  Also they have a great happy hour in the bar in the hotel.  Do not miss it!!",4,2019,05,15
120,A hip Hilton in London,"We loved our stay at the Hilton Bankside. Our room was big and comfortable, the location is perfect and the decor in the hotel is modern and hip. A big shout out goes to the staff who made our stay very special. We were very impressed.",5,2019,05,15
120,"Very good hotel, but check your bill at checkout","Pros:  Stayed 4 nights recently, the room was spacious, very clean and well serviced by housekeeping.  The bed was very comfortable with lovely linens.  Water was replenished each day along with biscuits which were yummy.  Our room was not available when we arrived at 1pm but we expected that on a busy Saturday.  When we returned from a visit to the nearby Tate Modern our luggage had already been delivered to our room. There are lots of accessible usb ports for charging your phone and the blackout drapes did a fantastic job of keeping all light out of the room.

Cons:  My only complaint is that when I checked out, the rate charged to me was higher than the rate I originally booked (and verified at check in).  I showed my email confirmation to the checkout employee but she told me the correct rate was the higher one.  She finally called over a manager who quickly rectified the issue but I don't think this should've happened at all, so verify your bill at check out!",4,2019,05,12
120,Excellent stay!,"My wife and I had an excellent stay, room was lovely and very clean. Staff all very polite and service was excellent. Great location for what we needed. Wish we could have stayed longer! Would 100% use the hotel again! ",5,2019,05,12
120,First stay at this hotel,"As soon as I entered this new hilton hotel I was struck by the efficient but very pleasant staff/atmoshphere.  Room very comfy, excellent breakfast choice.  What did strick me was that every memeber of staff  from the front door, receptionist, bar staff, breaksfast room staff, housekeeping staff were exceptionally helpful.  I will certainly be using this hotel again and very happy to recommend it. ",5,2019,05,11
120,like sleeping in a cloud,"Possibly the comfiest hotel bed I've ever slept in. 
Nice quiet room, lovely shower and toiletries after a very long and difficult day in London. 
Very friendly helpful reception staff. 
I didn't use any of the facilities or restaurants but overall looked really good with a nice pool. 
Only negative (and it was very small) was that my room hairdryer sounded and smelt like it was about to explode at any time and I was a little worried about setting off the smoke alarms if it did.",5,2019,05,11
120,"Spacious rooms in a new, chic hotel in a great London neighborhood","The Hilton Bankside has king sized beds, a walk-in rain shower, and a convenient location in the Borough Market neighborhood. These things are rare in central London hotels. The Distillery bar is open and spacious and has 100 types of gin as well as other libations and snacks. I highly recommend this hotel -- especially if you are a loyal Hilton customers and/or doing business in the financial district.",4,2019,05,10
120,"Mostly Plus, a couple of Minus","Checking in was great. I believe it was Cristina who was extremely helpful. Room was very clean and servicing of it was excellent. Everything we needed.
Couple of minus- whatever they have decided to use as a fragrance infuser(?) in the lobby is overpowering and irritating.
Breakfast- the host and hostess were terrific, the waitstaff was awful. Always seemed to be running around looking busy, but not attentive to serving coffee or replenishing it. The hosts were doing most of that job. We did notice Gabriele on the last day who was very good. 
That said, those 2 minor things would not discourage us from staying again. It is in a great location.",4,2019,05,09
120,Anniversary Treat,"Loved this hotel, it definitely has the wow factor.  Upon check in offered a glass of fizz which is when they got our first brownie points, but then the main winning factor was the turn down service even for the standard rooms (slippers by the bed with a bottle of water).  Spa/pool was lovely and clean and rooms a good size for London.  My only, very small gripe, was that it was our anniversary and I had asked for a nice room, but although the room was nice we over looked a wooden thing so had no view.  The hotel did however leave us out a treat and we had quite a bit of stuff to do outside the hotel so it wasn’t worth asking to move.  ",5,2019,05,09
120,Lovely facility and nice location for walking to sites,"The building has been nicely updated- area is great for walking to most attractions-
Front desk and concierge was exceptional- dining room
Had good food selection 
Area was quiet with small
Store next door for any needed items",5,2019,05,08
120,Great hotel - one slight niggle!,"Stayed here for one night and check in was quick and efficient. Room was spacious with everything you would expect. Had a drink in the bar - and normally in 5 star hotels this comes with peanuts, pretzels, olives, or whatever. Not a huge pile, just something to nibble on. My wife asked at the bar and we were eventually given a small bowl of tasteless popcorn. Room service was quick and the food was hot and well prepared. The following morning the pool was a little busy but not for long. It is large enough for a proper swim and a refreshing start to the day. Would definitely stay here again.",4,2019,05,08
120,Great hotel,"Beautiful interior design, comfy rooms and very good breakfast with great selection for all (even gluten free bread etc.) 
They have gym and pool as well.
A bit pricey, but def a good choice when in the city.",5,2019,05,07
120,Trendy and Fun hotel ,"I love this hotel! Been here many times and had a great time! It’s located right next to the Tate modern and walks along the river towards the southbank and towards tower bridge are really nice! The Globe theatre is minutes away and tons of restaurants! 

The hotel is great! Clean modern rooms! Very handsome concierge!!! Generous executive longe! Gym is well equipped! The hote bar have a great selection of gin and tonics!!! ",5,2019,05,07
120,"Trendy hotel, best suited for young travellers","Location
Bankside is buzzing, especially for young people. The hotel is a 10 minute walk from Southwark tube station and 10 minutes from Bankside Thames clipper pier. There are lots of restaurants in the area, a small Sainsburys and Tesco Extra on its doorstep and an M&S food hall about 500m away. 

Check-in and out/Concierge/Doormen
The two female check-in staff were efficient, albeit not warm and friendly. The doormen and concierge are excellent and will go out of their way to help guests.

Foyer/Bar/Restaurant
The decor is modern and slightly 'industrial'. The foyer is a very busy area. When we stayed, there were large groups of European and Asian tourists congregating. The hotel lacks a lounge for guests to sit in and relax (unless you have access to the Executive lounge, of course).

The bar has great staff and a huge menu of drinks, including 100 gins.

Breakfast is extensive and well-presented. It offers good choices for vegetarians and vegans. Breakfast staff vary from excellent to the mediocre - some provided commendable personal service, whilst others bordered on bruskness. 

Bedroom and bathroom
Rooms are modern with everything that you might need in the right place. Beds are 6 foot wide with high quality bedding. Bathrooms are large and of high quality.

To sum up, we had a very good stay despite experiencing some early morning noise because our room was close to the lifts on the first floor. We paid £155 per room and £20 per person for breakfast. For London, this was good value for a 5 star hotel. We did however feel that the hotel is more suited to younger travellers on the move than older people who are looking for a relaxing break in London.",4,2019,05,07
120,Excellent all round hotel ,"Our first stay at this particular Hilton, and it will certainly become a favourite of their London hotels for us. Staff very friendly from the outset, the rooms are of a high quality finish and ours was of good size for this part of London. One of the better Executive Lounges with excellent breakfast, afternoon tea and evening selections as well as general size and ambiance.

Another great plus is a good size swimming pool. All capped off with the ideal central location for events or activities in the East (02, ExCel) or shops and entertainment in the West End.

120,Fantastic Hotel delivering 5*luxury,"Wow what an amazing stay, from the minute you enter the lobby the opulence is there to greet you. The staff at this prestigious hotel cannot do enough to please the customer, from concierge, to the main reception to the cleaners that you meet in the corridors, they greet you with such politeness that is so often so missed in many other hotels. Thank you Hilton for making my stay such a pleasurable one, the rooms are very spacious, with quality luxury bedding and tv can be listened to in the bathroom through the bathroom speakers. I wouldn’t stay in any other hotel in London now after staying here. Why not spoil yourself if you are in the epicentre of London, only 3 mins walk from the tube, (Southwark tube from Waterloo: only 1 stop)straight across the street head down and take your first major left and you will see the Hilton in all of its splendour. Enjoy your stay; I know I did.",5,2019,05,04
120,"Booked Hotel for my Partners Birthday, also day i decided to propose.","Hilton Bankside looks amazing amd is so confortable, all staff were fantastic. Thank you to Angelo for sorting out the room and makeing it extra special. Augusto Stach in the bar, made some of the best drinks i have ever had. I highly recommend his old Fashion, Whisky Sour and espresso martini. He gave us great service and exceptional drinks.",5,2019,05,03
120,“ Great place to stay in London “,"I had a three day visit with my relatives in London recently and I chose to stay at The Hilton London Bankside. It was a great choice because its an awesome hotel with a great staff that is very attentive to customer needs. I recommend it highly for your stay in London, it’s a very modern designed hotel with food to die for. It’s centrally located with easy access to most of London’s famous attractions, not to mention that the Tate Modern museum is right across the street. Stay there when in London, and like me you will be glad you did. Enough said.",5,2019,04,30
120,Great hotel for business,"I stayed for business and found this hotel to be top notch. Check in and check out were quick and flawless. Staff were all polite and efficient. Housekeeping did a great job on the room including turning down the bed, putting on some music, setting out a bottle of water, etc. - really impressive. The room was modern, nicely furnished, with great towels and bathroom. The TV was great, and there were plenty of power outlets. This was basically a perfect stay. Well done! I will definitely stay there again.",5,2019,04,30
120,The best stay in London,"This was my second time at this hotel, i had a great experience on my first visit so we decided to stay again in the same hotel when we visited London. This time we traveled with my brother and his wife. We booked 2 king rooms . Because of a very bad weather in London LHR airport was a lot of delays so we left from Amsterdam 2 hours later. And when we arrived traveling from airport to hotel we had a lot of traffic. Anyway when we arrived at the hotel at 2:30pm we felt exhausted from all that rough day so we couldn’t wait to be accommodated at least one of the rooms so we could had the opportunity to take a shower. The check in process was smooth but we were told that they didn’t had any available room at the moment so we had to wait till 3pm. So we decided to have a coffee next to the lobby and wait for the room. An hour later I decide to go at the front desk and check and hopefully the rooms to be available. Nothing was available not even one room. I got upset because we were there since 2:30 and they promised us that by 3pm they will have the rooms ready. The girl at the front desk was trying so hard even contacting the room cleaning staff. They saw my frustration and they called the front desk manager Chriss. She was very professional and so caring, she kept feeling sorry about the situation and she promised us that really soon i will get both rooms. She even asked me if I wanted to have a drink on the house in the meantime. We just had coffee so we said no. After 10-15 min she came to us personally and gave the keys for both rooms . And  for the trouble we had she offered us a complementary breakfast. We were delighted for the way she treated us in a very special way. The rooms were in high floor like I requested but no view ( i was aware of that) The rooms were very clean with all the necessary amenities . We found it very useful to charge our phones the usb port on each side of the bed. The breakfast at the restaurant was great. I think is worth it to even pay for it with what the offer you for breakfast. I wanted to thank again the whole staff from bellman, front desk, room cleaning and the last not the least Chriss that made our stay special. I will definitely be back to the same hotel and suggested to all my friends and family visiting London to stay at this Hilton Hotel",5,2019,04,29
120,Really enjoyable,"Amazing situation, just behind the tate modern and very near the Millenium Brigde.
Lots of details as candy bar at the entrance, compliment water every day, compliment tea and coffee every day and the name of the person who cleans the room each day.
So comfortable and nice rooms, personnel very very very nice, always looking for the wellbeing of the customers.",5,2019,04,28
120,Quick business stay,We arrived last night and have been constantly well cared for by the team at the hotel. The room wasn’t ready on arrival but we were offered breakfast the next am and a drink. Both experiences were fantastic. Ali Asgar a chef cooked me up some eggs and hollandaise which were all perfectly cooked as was the rest of the buffet breakfast. The team in the restaurant also consistently looked after us. Hats off to the team at the Hilton Bankside. Probably one of the best hotel experiences for some time!,5,2019,04,28
120,OXBO Brunch,"Diner at OXBO for bottomless brunch 
Soooo much choice of food, a great selection, although the brunch was 12-4pm we were still being served prosessco
Alexandru Stan was such a great person to service us, answered our questions and continued to fill up our glasses.
We will definitely return x ",5,2019,04,27
120,"Very nice hotel, well located","We stayed six nights at the hotel, and the hotel had a really good location for a London holiday with walking distance to four underground stations and three piers. We tried the breakfast only one day, as we wanted to check out the local pub breakfast. But the breakfast was good, but the egg station was a bit hidden. The bar by the entrance was also nice, and it was a nice place to wind down in the evening. 
The room we had was nice, all though the view was just a brick wall... The bathroom was fine for me but it was not for tall people - my boyfriend is 2 meter tall and he could not shower standing straight as the sealing mounted shower head was in the way.
Staff was all kind and helpful! 
",5,2019,04,26
120,Excellent place to stay to visit London,The staff are pleasant and professional from the moment you arrive. We left our bags early in the day and returned to find them already in the room. Very comfortable bed   - which I have noticed this trip to the UK hasn’t always been the case at several of the places we have stayed. This hotel is well located to Southwark and London Bridge stations and the river walk. We didn’t eat here as there are so many good places nearby. I really enjoyed being able to have a swim during my stay. I would definitely stay again.,4,2019,04,24
120,Best customer service,"The focus of the Hilton Bankside staff is to provide superior customer service to their guests.  They made this obvious before we even arrived at the hotel.  A reservation specialist contacted me by email to confirm our unusual reservation.  We reserved 3 rooms because we were traveling with our friends and their 2 teenagers.  She committed to do her best to assign adjoining rooms for the family and provided an email address for their team of concierges.
We contacted the hotel when we changed our plans.  They made the addition of the fourth night easy. They were kind enough to offer the same rate as the previous 3 nights even though the price on the website was higher.
A couple days prior to arrival, the front desk team reached out to us again.  We sorted out our arrival and were assured we would be welcomed in the lounge if our rooms weren’t ready because we have Diamond status with Hilton Honors.
Once we arrived, the wonderful service continued.  Each member of the staff was friendly and helpful.  The rooms were just as we requested; clean, functional, and comfortable.  Housekeeping did a great job.
The breakfast buffet is fabulous.  The teenage boys traveling with us loved trying everything on the buffet and the special treats offered to them, like the best hot chocolate ever!  We all enjoyed such that we could sightsee without stopping to eat until late in the afternoon.
The location is excellent.  It is a 7-minute walk to the Bankside Ferry Station, Southwark Station, or Blackfriars Station (which is very convenient from Gatwick).  It is about a 10-minute walk to Waterloo Station (which is very convenient for Stonehenge and Hampton Court).
We will certainly stay at the Hilton Bankside each time we are lucky enough to visit London.  If you like a good, well located hotel with excellent customer service…you should stay here too.",5,2019,04,23
120,Fantastic Hotel – would stay again,"We thoroughly enjoyed our two-night stay at Hilton Bankside. 
The staff were very welcoming, kind and attentive. Thank you to you all, especially Timo (breakfast), Nadja (room maid) and the gentleman at reception.
Our room was a great size, very quiet and really clean. The bed was extremely comfortable. The breakfast buffet was to die for, with two generous and skilled chefs on hand.
The hotel is ideally situated. It's a mere two minutes' walk from Tate Modern (there are also several supermarkets close by).
We can highly recommend Hilton Bankside and hope to return soon.

120,Fantastic place to stay,"This is a really fabulous hotel in a great location, nothing to fault here at all, it's totally perfect. The staff are very attentive, making you feel like you are the only one staying here, and the lovely touches make it a special stay. It's also very central for sightseeing.  I would recommend this hotel without any hesitation.",5,2019,04,23
120,Clean and excellent service,"The hotel is excellent location ,staff is helpful,special thanks to Miss Chris yousif helped in check in procedure, We also asked for screw driver ,they immediately send the engineer to help ,Hotel is excellent for families,clean renovated ,spacious room.",5,2019,04,23
120,Great Stay,"Just spent three great nights at Hilton Bankside and hope to return soon. Very impressed with everything, especially the friendly greetings and service from all staff. 

It was a pleasure to meet Georgiana Moroz who had gone out of her way to make my booking , a birthday gift for my partner, perfect. Great communication and attention to detail. 

The executive lounge is lovely but would be better if the staff knew which dishes were served and crucially which are vegetarian. 

We hope to be back soon.  Thanks again Georgiana. ",5,2019,04,22
120,Seminar on Hilton,"I attended a seminar in the specific hotel which was organized by a big company. Easy to access and the personnel friendly and ready to provide you with guidance for whatever you might need. The place where this venue took place was in minus one, but all facilities and electrical installations worked just right. Finger food , coffee and refreshments were provided during the breaks and were all at a very good standard. Out of curiosity I asked in the reception the respective price for one night stay at a standard room and it seemed reasonable according to my knowledge from the competition. ",5,2019,04,22
120,Birthday trip for 12 year olds,"This visit was booked as a birthday trip for our twin boys.  The hotel is fantastically located right behind Tate Modern, so lots of tourist destination are within a 30 min walk.  The hotel is very new, well designed with a great indoor pool.  The rooms are spacious (huge for central London!).  The service was excellent - this Hilton is a winner!!",5,2019,04,21
120,Comfortable bed and rooms,"Large comfortable rooms.  Very narrow window offering limited light/view.  Executive lounge has very poor options for vegetarians.
Nice pool but jacuzzi not working and no sauna nor steam room.  Help yourself chocolates and sweets for Easter was a lovely touch.  Also some fantastic flower arrangements in lobby.",4,2019,04,20
120,Great Value and Experience,Our family of 4 stayed 3 nights last weekend.  We had two adjoining rooms    They were both beautiful and clean.  It was close to a metro station as well.  We found the staff very pleasant and breakfast was wonderful with a lot of options on the buffet and an attentive staff.  We would not hesitate to stay here again.,5,2019,04,20
120,Not for the first time and won't be the last,"Hilton bankside review

As many Hilton hotels i stayed in the past Hilton bankside was the best. We stayed for the first time back in 2017 so we decided to book family suite and give it a comprehensive review.
The review will be divided to sections so you can go directly to the interested sections 

Check in process 
It's a busy hotel so i tried online check- in and activate phone key which was brilliant idea and smart where it detects your position and the nearest locked access if it's a room door, elevator or the lounge but eather it didn't work in the start and it's require another activation from the reception or I didn't know how to do it so came back to the reception waiting in the busy que. 

Staff
To cut it short the staff is the core for this hotel and the best in this experience in our trip.

Room
We booked a family suite which contained bedroom with huge bathroom having rain shower and bath tub.
The room was big and fantastic with comfy bed 
2 outlet each side of the bed with USB with outlet. Also setting area with sofa bed and dining table with tiny bathroom which become very handy for the kids.
Sink was so high for the kids to reach we ask them if they have some sort of step for the kids to step on and they took 15 mins and bring one to us ... my point if you need any thing .. just ask and they will do there best.

In room dining 
Ordered pizza and pasta for sure there was a room for improving the food quality in that order. The timing also was a bit late but they apologised and told me that juice become free as an apology .. very nice from them showing how much they care.
Waffle was ordered another day and it was really amazing with blueberries and different topping sauce.
Try ice cream chocolate fudge with creme brulee .. i hope the hotel give more attention to the room service food quality 

Restaurant 
For our reservation we have breakfast included served in the executive lounge not the full breakfast but it's separated quite area and you can pay and order extra dishes
Executive Lounge serve breakfast, afternoon tea with snacks, night meal .. something to think about 
To complete the review we tried the full breakfast buffet one day at OXBO restaurant 

Laundry 
Tried the laundry finished in the same day 
Prices might be little high but shall you compare it to going to nearest laundry .. it's up to you 

Internet
Free internet is available with clever setup for how many days for several devices so it's one time setup 

As i tried 4 different Hilton hotels this year in London, It's hard to compare this hotel with other Hilton hotels in London for sure Hilton bankside is in a much higher level.

To answer the usual question, should I stay again in London Hilton bankside hotel ? For me it's an easy Yes if it's for leisure or family vacation, Yes if you are taxi/Uber user so locationshould not be an issue, Yes if it's ok to walk 6 mins to Southwark underground station.
Next stay will review the Gym & Spa

Thanks Hilton bankside for this experience ",5,2019,04,20
120,5 Star experience at great value,"My Family and I spent 5 nights and the room and service at the Hilton Bankside was exceptional.

The location and the quality of the staff is second to none. A must book hotel for business or pleasure, very family friendly hotel.
",5,2019,04,19
120,One night stay in a calm hotel,Stayed only for one night and again a lovely stay. The room is large and is blacked out for sleeping like a baby (ie all through the night). Very clean. Good quality linen. Very well located. Welcoming staff on entering.This time we had a longer check in than previously and on a slight disappointing note wasn't welcomed back as we usually are as a returning guest/silver member. Just an observation! I always like the seasonal decor in the lobby. This time the Easter Bunny,4,2019,04,19
120,Fantastic,The hotel was very well appointed.  The staff were very helpful.  It was very clean very roomy and very well located for our trip to London.  It was within walking distance to great attractions.  The Underground was very close as well.,5,2019,04,17
120,Perfect and relaxing,"From the second I walked into the hotel I was amazed at how luxury and clean it was. I stayed for 2 nights and I had an amazing experience. 

This hotel is a great quiet location in London (only a few minutes to the Tate modern) where you can easily travel around different places in London. There are lots of restaurants nearby which are good price and serve brilliant food.

I would like to thank Jay at the distillery bar for being an exceptional bartender when making our drinks and telling us the history of the hotel which was very interesting.

Thank you London Hilton Bankside for making our stay an amazing one and for all the staff which contributed to this!",5,2019,04,16
120,Nice new hotel,Great new hotel in a really good location. The staff were really welcoming and the service in the bar and restaurant was good too. The room was really well furnished with nice decor and I would definitely stay here again whether for business or leisure. The only thing that could be improved on in my view is the quality of the packaging or presentation of the toiletries in the bathroom. Didn’t match the quality of the room. ,5,2019,04,13
120,Not the Hotel You Want,"My second trip in 7 months to this hotel. It's a nice hotel for the most part but it's a little pricey for what you get. 

This trip my room heat didn't work when we checked into the room and two days later we finally asked them to fix it.

One day later it then stopped working again. They then came and fidgeted with it and it worked and yep! You guessed it. It stopped working by morning.  

I get things break. Sh** happens right?  We wouldn't have minded changing rooms if it wasn't for the fact that the engineer is telling guest relations it's our fault the heat doesn't work and guest relations is acting like it's kind of our fault we are moving rooms. Pretty sure they don’t grasp that spending more then an hour on a Friday to move rooms wasn’t what we wanted to do on a holiday. 

With the lack of ownership for the heat not working and the fact we paid £220 upgrade the time spent moving rooms left us a little peeved. 

The hotel is nice but the bar and restaurant are a bit overpriced for what you get.  All my coworkers swear by the Citizen M down the street. My next stop will be there. 

So if you get a better priced room nearby take it!  This Hilton is just not what a Hilton should be.",2,2019,04,12
120,My second time was as good as the first,You walk into an impressive lobby and are quickly helped by a knowledgeable and friendly staff. The rooms are well appointed and quiet for a good sleep. The Breakfast is a standout. Get a room with an outside window for more light. I was disappointed with the recognition of my Honors Gold status. But it will not stop me from returning. ,4,2019,04,11
120,What’s not to love ,"Another Hilton Triumph my husband booked a weekend break for my birthday and as Londoners we wanted a location where we could walk to the all things we wanted to do. 

The deluxe room felt just that with the ultra modern design and almost new feel I loved the added Touches with hidden panels for the fridge with complimentary drinks, the tea point with a great selection of choices and biscuits.

The staff were amazing and gave us complimentary glasses of Prosecco and excellent service. We had a wonderful stay!",5,2019,04,11
120,Great hotel in a great location,"Choose the hotel not only for the great location, but also for having executive rooms with separate sleeping area and a living area with a sofa bed. Access to the lounge well worth the rate. Easy to walk to many attractions and easy access to the underground.",5,2019,04,11
120,Great service at Oxbo,Just a quick note to let people know that I received fantastic service from Florin in the Oxbo restaurant during my last visit. It was quiet and late so it would have been easy to just do the minimum but he certainly went above what was required to ensure I was take care off. Staff like that are invaluable. ,5,2019,04,11
120,“Superb Hotel”,"Cannot fault this hotel, the staff couldn’t do enough for you, and were extremely pleasant at all times. The decor was fantastic, very contemporary, outstanding cleanliness, we wouldnt hesitate to stop here again.",5,2019,04,07
120,"Great location, great facility, wonderful staff",I had a great stay. Upgraded to suite with free snacks and drinks in refrigerator. Beautiful flowery smell at hotel entrance. Great breakfast spread at the restaurant. Rooms clean and spacious. Enjoyed the club lounge. Thank you!,5,2019,04,07
120,Loved....,"..everything about this hotel. Stayed for 10 nights and felt like home.  Staff was so welcoming and accommodating.  Customer service is of foremost importance to me when I travel and this hotel did not disappoint. I am diamond status so not sure if that is the reason for any of the ""perks"" but... rooms was tidied beautifully while we were out sightseeing.  Cookies were delivered every night. Staff called me by name.  Executive lounge staff was always offering to get things for me and went out of their way to get things for me that were not readily available (ie a sweet treat when sweets were not out).  John (concierge) and front desk staff George, Christina, Georgiana (may have spelled wrong) were very very helpful with my request. Housekeeping staff always pleasant when passed in hall. Did not use pool or restaurant but looked nice. 
Have never been to a ""regular Hilton"" with this level of service before (expected at Waldorf and Conrad). Thank you to all the staff....many names I do not know.  You are all doing a great job.  Will stay again on next visit.",5,2019,04,06
120,Night in London,"My wife and I had a work event and decided to spend the night in London and try this hotel, having previously stayed at the Conrad, using Honors points. What an amazing experience, from the check-in experience, friendliness of staff in Exec lounge, comfortable bed and amazingly quiet bedrooms - we had been given an upgrade and our room over looked a train line so was very nervous it was going to be noisy. My wife who is a VERY light sleeper didn’t hear a thing!

Despite it being cheaper and less points to use for a reward night, it certainly felt better value for money than other London Hilton hotels we have stayed in.

Great hotel all round and couldn’t recommend it more highly! ",5,2019,04,06
120,Mr,Excellent place to stay and very central. Buffet breakfast one of the best i've had in any hotel. Staff very friendly and efficient.  Great pool and gym to start your day. I would recommend this hotel as a great place to stay.,5,2019,04,01
120,10 out of 10,"This is a great hotel in a great neighbourhood. I stayed on business for 1 night and from the moment I arrived till the moment I checked out everything was perfect.  Friendly and helpful bell staff, check in was efficient, professional and very friendly. Room had all I need and more and was very stylish. Nice pool and gym on site.",5,2019,03,31
120,Hilton quality on Bankside,"your standard Hilton quality in the Bankside business neighbourhood, near tourist attractions such as Tate Modern, London Eye, etc. Easy to get to the City. Nice bar on ground floor. Standard business food.",4,2019,03,30
120,Excellent choice for business,"This is an Excellent choice for business accommodation. Very good service, quality breakfast and generally very good restaurants and convenient location. I would certainly recommend it for business travelers ",5,2019,03,29
120,Fabulous ,"Wonderful hotel with exceptionally helpful and friendly staff. Room beautifully serviced with a personalised welcome note and treat. The facilities, including gym and pool, are exceptional. The hotel is convenient for transport links and local attractions. It is certainly one of the best in London ",5,2019,03,28
120,6 day stay: fantastic ,"This property was fantastic to stay at. Located near many must see attractions that can be walked to or by using the Underground. 
The service at this Hilton was impeccable and the rooms were very comfortable after a long day of touring. As a Hilton Gold Member there are significant benefits. Ask about these upon check in.
The Distillery Bar and OXBO restaurant were pleasant surprises as well. 

This property will be my home base again in London!",5,2019,03,28
120,Another great stay,"This was our fourth stay at this hotel, the staff here are all excellent, the room was well serviced by housekeeping and always clean and fresh, the rooms are kept in very good order and as this hotel is only a few years old the condition is in very good modern condition. The facilities and restaurant are very good with a very good menu to suit all tastes, my favourite meal time is breakfast and this for me is always very good with all types of food available, my preference is the full English which is a good set up for the day, this hotel is a gem and is ideally placed to visit the theatres and London attractions and is located just  minutes from the Tate Modern as well as the Globe theatre, also close is the millennium foot bridge. This hotel is not to be missed.",5,2019,03,23
120,Amazing and perfect location!,"Everything is great from the perfect location (all key eaters of London are within easy reach) to the room design. Great executive lounge, pool and gym.  Staff is eager to help at all times! My go to place while in a London...",5,2019,03,23
120,Can’t go wrong with a stay at Bankside!,"Felt like a 5-star hotel without the pretentiousness that often comes with that status. Staff were attentive, friendly, and there to make the experience better. Breakfast is full English and outstanding quality & freshness. Rooms clean, spacious, and in very nice condition. Bed creaked a little, but we thought it was quite comfortable.

Location is sneakily excellent, for those not familiar with London. 3 minutes walk to Thames walkway, 10 minutes walk to Borough Market, 5 minutes walk to Blackfriars (Thameslink) & Southwark (tube) stations. Jogged (ran) along Thames River every day, crossing over at Waterloo, Millennium, Golden Jubilee, and Westminster bridges depending on distance or route I wanted.

Bar staff was superb (Vladimir in particular) and we enjoyed a few nightcaps in The Distillery after long days walking about London.

Highly recommended!",5,2019,03,22
120,"Hotel OK, but had bad experience with bar/resturant staff over drinks","The hotel itself is good. However, my group didn't have any seating at the Bar so we asked if we could be order drinks and sit in the restaurant. We were allocated a table and then a member of staff moved us to another table and then another member of staff told us we couldn't sit at the table and had go back into the bar for standing room only.  Somehow it was like our fault and the staff were being real jobsworths.   Being a guest at the hotel and paying so much for a room I was really upset by the way we were treated. Don't think I will be coming back if this is the way we are treated.  Customer service rating: 1 out of 10.",2,2019,03,20
120,Modern Hilton - Top spot!,"Stayed here for 2 nights. Great room, clean and modern. Club lounge had a great breakfast and selection throughout the day. Pool was functional but clean and warm - great to have a pool at all in London! Would defo. Recommend.",5,2019,03,20
120,"Great location, great hotel!","The Hilton Bankside staff was extremely attentive and helpful. The room was modern, clean and comfortable. And the heated indoor pool was amazing everyday after sightseeing! The location is perfect - close to a tube station and a five minute walk to the south bank. Tate was also only a five minute walk. The breakfast each morning in the hotel restaurant was pretty good, but dinner was a bust. The service at dinner was slow and forgetful, and the menu lacking any staples or comfort. We loved everything about this hotel, but had to drop it to 4 stars due to the poor dinner experience we had in the restaurant. ",4,2019,03,19
120,Saturday night stay,"A fantastic hotel with very professional staff and a great location near the Tate and the river. We were in London for a 40th and used the Hilton Bankside for our stay over, if we were staying longer than one night we would’ve used the facilities a bit more ! The pool looked very inviting but alas we were short on time.",5,2019,03,19
120,Another great stay,"I have stayed at this property for the past two years.  All staff is extremely friendly, restaurant and bar is fantastic, and the exec lounge is superb. Check out the Foxes around the property.  Really cool.   I will be back in a few weeks.",5,2019,03,17
120,Such a delight,"Absolute superstar of Hiltons in my opinion. This hotel gives you boutique hotel feeling, even thought it’s considerably big. 
1. The area is so safe and lovely, the trainstation (London Bridge) is very near (10-15 min walk) and is about 30-40 min trainride away from Gatwick airport. So comfortable.
2. Our room was spacious, spotlessly clean at all times. I think it was cleaned two times a day? 
3. Staff is so welcoming, helpful and friendly.
4. Kids friendly, but not too family centered. Good for couples, business stay and also suitable for families. 
5. BREAKFAST- so delightful. Egg station was so good! Plus vegetarian options in the restaurant.
6. So stylish and has certain class and lovely feeling :)

It really was such a nice getaway to London, HWill be back very soon :)",5,2019,03,16
120,A very good Hilton.,"This Hilton puts many of the older properties to shame. Modern, comfortable and very clean. The room was a good size for London and very quiet. Had a really good nights sleep. Breakfast was very good with an excellent choice. No chance on this visit to use the pool but certainly will next time. All in all very impressive.",4,2019,03,16
120,Solid choice ,"A tasteful new build in a thriving part of town. Rooms are small-ish but functional with great linens and toiletries. Staff friendly and helpful. Certainly a good 4-star choice. 

OxBo bar is fun and busy (although could do with more serving staff?) and food overall was great, although if you’re seated in the banquettes - it’s quite a stretch to the table! ",4,2019,03,14
120,Great location,"Stayed here for a few nights over the weekend, as it’s not too far from Waterloo station, Southwick, London Bridge, and a few minute’s walk to the Tate Modern and Borough Market, so perfect location for what we wanted to do and go. Some really good places to eat nearby as well.

Upon entering was very surprised at how modern and stylish the hotel was, for a Hilton! Had a standard room, but the bed was huge and the room was really large for London. Beautiful bathroom. The room had all the facilities required, fridge, kettle, safe, aircon, and plugs by the bed. Wifi was good. Only grumbles were no view to speak of or much natural light, had to keep the curtains shut as you were looking straight into the other rooms. The bed wasn’t as comfortable as Id hoped, it just wasn’t to my taste and a bit hard, but that’s just me.

The staff were great. I had accidentally dropped my oyster card and train tickets in the lobby, and on arriving back 20 minutes later panicking they had found them and put them to one side. I couldn’t have been more relieved!
Would recommend and definitely stay again!",5,2019,03,13
120,6 stars,"As usual at bank side the staff will do any thing possible the satisfy any requests or to exceed ur expectation 
Grate team work and hope they feel appreciated as they deserve without them the place have no life but the staff make u come
Back again and again ",5,2019,03,12
120,Worst Hilton ever,The rooms barely have windows. The decor is hideous. The lights do not work.  The food is inedible. The staff is so incredibly rude and unhelpful. Will never stay at this property or another Hilton again. ,1,2019,03,12
120,Really lovely experience with great staff ,"I stayed here with my daughter for 2 nights mid-Feb. We’ve visited London a lot and decided to stay at the Hilton Bankside due to its location. It’s set in a nice area, really close to the Tate Modern. The check in experience was great, and I managed to use their text service while travelling on the train to request early check in, which they quickly arranged. Our room was a 1 bedroom suite and was really nice. Comfortable bed, big bathroom and nice lounge area. It was also really quiet. We had access to the executive lounge, but the access times were the only thing that wasn’t made clear. So on the first evening we were too late for the inclusive drinks. However, Gergely Muller the staff member who was working in the lounge was really kind and ensured we were given a glass of wine each. Gergely was very professional and helpful each day we went into the lounge. We told Georgiana at reception the following day about the confusion over the lounge times and she apologised for this,  and agreed to pass on our feedback. She also very kindly arranged for a treat to be left for my daughter to congratulate her for some work she was doing. The staff really went out of their way to make our stay special. Would recommend this hotel and would definitely stay again. ",5,2019,03,12
120,Return visit and still as fabulous,"This is a gorgeous hotel, very clean and very stylish. We had the deluxe room and it was a good size. The bed is the best bed we have ever slept in so comfortable with high quality bedding. Overall a really nice hotel. We went in the bar both nights and great atmosphere.

We have stayed a twice now and would definitely return.",5,2019,03,12
120,Miss,"Stopped here for happy hour which was advertising  on the board as  by 1 get 1 for 1p the advert showed glasses of cocktails! 
however what the board outside doesn’t say is that it’s only for beers and wines!  Great warming atmospher with great modern decor , unfortunately with only 1 barman we had to wait 25 mins for our drinks!  Popped In The day after but was mindful about the happy hour advertising!",4,2019,03,10
120,Superb Hotel,"Superb hotel. Modern, attractive hotel in a good location for the tube, Borough Market and Tate Modern. Staff were great and it appeared that there were loads of them! Nothing too much trouble. Pool and gym were immaculate. Good breakfast. Very comfortable bed. Would definetly recommend and will stay again.",5,2019,03,10
120,All-round positive experience,"Hotel is maybe not in the best location of London, but basically a great 5*-star experience if you're up to take the taxi / metro to get to the city centre. Hotel staff was friendly, executive lounge was spacious with a good selection of drinks and the rooms were spacious. 

Leisure centre was mediocre though. Don't book this hotel if you want an exceptionally good spa experience, but the gym is fine.",5,2019,03,10
120,"1 night stay, London. ","No complaints here at all. 
Our room was huge (in comparison to other hotels we have stayed in in London) bathroom and shower big too. Decor nice and modern. Bed comfy and tea making facilities a bonus! 

Enjoyed a morning swim, pool good for lengths. Had fresh towels as you walked through to the gym/swimming pool area which was good! 

I'd stay here again.  ",5,2019,03,10
120,Our favorite hotel ,This is the best hotel we’ve ever stayed at. We’ve stayed here numerous times and there has never been a time that it didn’t feel like home. Especially thankful for Juan in the dining room and Andre in the bar. ,5,2019,03,10
120,Mr,"It was great vacation no doubts I’ll be back to the same hotel , the hotel was so nice clean and comfortable. While the vacation I met a person called Dan zgurschi from the concierge team of the hotel , he was so nice and was advising and helping me anytime I’ve needed, no words! Was amazing...",5,2019,03,09
120,Fabulous overnight stay,"This Hotel has a real luxury feel,with a friendly, welcoming atmosphere. 
Check in was quick and easy. We travelled as 2 couples so reserved 2 rooms. One room was ready to check-in at 2pm and the other was not. It was no problem, we left our bags in the room that was available and went off to explore London. We received a text later in the afternoon to advise that the 2nd room was ready. 
The rooms are spacious, the bed linen is good quality, the bathroom is  bright with everything you need. I really liked the quietness of each room. Not once did we hear our neighbours. 
The breakfast was excellent with lots of choice (they even had oat and soya milk) and it was very food quality too with friendly waiting staff. 
The bar is well-stocked with over 50 gins, ranging from your every day gins to more unusual tipples to try.  They have a delicious cocktail menu too. Its a great place to have a few beers early doors or have a night-cap on your way to bed.
The swimming pool is lovely and there is a small gym. at the Hotel that seemed popular.  
The location of the Hotel is perfect, just 5 minutes walk to the Tate Modern.
I have one slight criticism. Hilton - why are you using plastic straws and water bottles in the Hotel? Come on guys, this is not what the guests want in 2019.
Apart that this, I would thoroughly recommend this hotel and will return when I'm staying in London next time. Well done!",5,2019,03,06
120,Great stay lovely service,Really enjoyed the stay at Hilton. I think this should be the hilton flagship hotel. The room sizes are great and so is the service. I want to give my compliments to Alessia who was serving us at breakfast. She was very friendly and catered to all our needs. Its great to see hilton has high standards and really put in effort in training the staff. Great job.,5,2019,03,06
120,Amazing weekend away with family,"My family and I spent an amazing weekend in Hilton London Bankside. 
We enjoyed every single facility of the hotel: the amazing room, the Executive lounge, the food at Oxbo, the swimming pool and the fantastic service from every single member of staff. 
The highlight was how special they made my daughter feel with all the attention and special treats in the room. 
Thank you and we will definitely come back!",5,2019,03,06
120,Best hotel stay ever!,"Service is amazing, everyone is friendly. Breakfast had soy milk option for tea, which was fantastic. Room was beautiful, well taken care of. The bar has fantastic gjn and tonic drinks and I got to try a few my last night there. This was my second stay at this place and can't rave about it enough. It was both luxury and comfortable. ",5,2019,03,05
120,Comfortable hotel with excellent service,"My first stay at this Hilton, but likely won't be my last.

A weekend break in London was made even better by the central location. The excellent service started before I'd even arrived. Having forgotten a toothbrush, I messaged the hotel and found a dental kit in my room on arrival. No bath, but the waterfall shower was a dream!

Also lovely to come back in the evening to the beds being turned down and robes and slippers ready to use. A really nice touch.",5,2019,03,04
120,Such a lovely hotel,"I spent my last night after travelling the UK at the Hilton London Bankside and I could not have been happier with my stay. The hotel staff are so lovely and accommodating and nothing was too much trouble for them. The bed was so comfortable it felt like laying on a cloud.  Every time I return to London, I will be staying at this hotel. Thanks for a wonderful stay :)",5,2019,03,03
120,"Wonderful afternoon/evening, I will be back for sure","I have been to Hilton London BankSide with a friend:Everything about our evening was absolutely spot on! Fabulous, relaxing atmosphere, super friendly service, amazing food and great cocktails. And all great value. Special Thanks to Suman and Anabela for being thoughtful, attentive, smiling and professional since we arrived  Def recommend for either a date or night out with friends. Thanks guys!!!",5,2019,03,03
120,Fabulous lounge ,"This is not our first trip to this hotel. It looks a lot less impressive from the outside than it does on the inside. 
As you walk through the doors, you can not help but smile with the amazing way you are treated by every member of staff you come into contact with. Along with the quirky animal themes and the wonderful smell, it’s a real sanctuary. 

The family suites are fantastic. We have stayed in a number and we have no complaint whatsoever. 

The executive lounge is fabulous and a real haven within a haven. We have been looked after by Gergely Müller a number of times, and his smile is always there to keep you cheery! 

The leisure facilities are great and probably far too underused. Every time I have been there it has been remarkably quiet for such a wonderful location. 

Our only complaint during our stay this time was the issues with getting gluten free food for our daughter who has coeliac disease. However, when this complaint was raised, the kitchen and dining room staff tried so hard to accommodate and make it right. In fact, on our last day, Gergely even went out of his way to make my daughter a plate of GF sandwiches and GF cakes! He went above and beyond to make our visit to the lounge a very comfortable one.

I would love to thank the staff at this hotel for being so wonderful! ",4,2019,02,25
120,Will be back ,"I went to London for a day trip with a friend and ended up in The Distillery Bar at Hilton London Bankside. 
This place is one of a kind.. LOVED IT 10 out of 10.
The warm welcome from The Assistant Bar Manager Suman Poudel what an asset he is to the hotel. Throughout the evening Suman was very friendly and professional. 
This will definitely be my go to bar when in London. Can't wait to be back ",5,2019,02,25
120,You can Bank on a Great Experience at this Bankside Hotel,"We often choose to stay in Hilton or Doubletree to help with our points collection. However, even with no points I wouldn't hesitate to recommend this hotel. It's a great new addition to the Hilton family in London and full of little luxuries to enhance any stay.

We stayed for four nights and enjoyed the trip from start to end. We arrived early, but were still able to check in and the team on the front desk and reception area were all great, full of smiles and helpful.

We ate onsite one of the nights at the Oxbo and enjoyed the menu on offer and way the food tasted and was presented. The bar area is also a nice environment and offers half price drinks (well by second one for 1p) from 4pm to 6pm on the weekdays we ere staying there. A nice touch/treat to start the evening.

We used the pool on one afternoon which was clean, large and was like our own private sanctuary as was quite quiet at the time we visited. Very relaxing and you can do proper lengths too, if you so wish!

Definitely would suggest giving this hotel a try, from the welcome, to the room, to the break fast it was all great!

(They even have loads of sockets/USB chargers next to the actual beds... Yes, really!)",5,2019,02,24
120,Great 5 star experience ,"Stayed overnight when we went to London to watch the Harry Potter play. Fresh flowers and a classy reception area set the tone for our whole experience. Friendly,  helpful staff and spacious bedrooms...one of the best executive lounges I have seen and a lovely bar- what more could you ask for. Sadly we did not have much time in the hotel so could not use the on site leisure facilities,  wished we had booked two nights. It was my daughter's 25th birthday and she was lucky that there was a suite we could upgrade to. Our executive room was a touch of luxury,well designed and spacious. The bathroom was spotless and the bed was so comfy we wanted to take it home with us...we will return next time we are in London. ",5,2019,02,19
120,Fab hotel fab service,Great location for exploring London. Excellent executive lounge.  Exvellent service in all areas.  Only down on the whole stay was poor cooked breakfast.  Not the usual Hilton choice or quality.  Pastries however are to die for which compensated.  Will return.,4,2019,02,18
120,Excellent,"Booked Executive room for a birthday and anniversary. Have been here before and like last time, was not disappointed. Our room was fabulous, clean and spacious. The lounge was also excellent with attentive staff. Highly recommend this hotel.",5,2019,02,18

120,An excellent hotel in a great part of London,"I have stayed at this hotel on a number of occasions now. The hotel is up to date and the rooms are always in fantastic condition when we arrive. The staff are helpful and attentive. The hotel is located in Bankside, a relatively quiet place considering how central it is.This is now my go to hotel if I am staying in London.",5,2019,02,12
120,Quick Business Trip in Nov 2018,"as a normal practice the hotel blocked GBP 500 on my debit card and on my check out I settled GBP 900+ in invoice however we are now on 11th Feb 2019 and the hotel has not yet released my block. Repeated follow up from my office only receives a response ""accounts is checking please give us some time"". All i need is if you released please provide evidence so i can resolve it with the bank or admit your mistake and release my block immediately. How can any traveller trust your hotel if you maintain such a irresponsible attitude!?!? or is this plain simple fraud??? Comments on stay...no luggage assistance...rooms are good...location is good...people at reception cold...restaurant staff just ok!",1,2019,02,11
120,What’s not to like,"Only stayed for one night but great location, clean all round, friendly staff, gorgeous room with oh so comfy bed!

The room was clean and fresh, bathroom was lovely and little treats such as being able to listen to the tele in the shower go a long way! 

The black out blinds and big bed meant for Avery comfy nights sleep. 

Pool area was clean as a very stay all round for someone who is 23 weeks pregnant.",5,2019,02,10
120,Our favourite hotel in London,"My wife and I come here on a regular basis. The hotel feels very new, elegant, and luxurious. We believe it only recently was upgraded from 4.5 stars to 5 stars, and rightly so! It's one of only 4 Hilton brand hotels in London, which offers a fitness, pool, and executive lounge. Speaking of which, it is a very slick lounge with very helpful staff. Every time we are here, lovely Gergely spoils us with drinks, olives, and his stories. A+ in customer service. The Oxbo restaurant recently changed their menu to a more limited, yet, tasty menu. The Distillery Bar brings great memories to us as we spent New Year's here, enjoying succulent drinks and a great ambiance with a lot of people, yet enough privacy to not have to endure the usual over-crowdedness of London restaurants.
As usual, there are also things that could be improved (yet not impacting the number of stars we are giving):
- We have had numerous issues with housekeeping breaking or removing our items (amongst others laptop and our own bowls/cutlery).
- Considering we're recurring guests (44 nights life-time), some of the guest relations staff are surprisingly unprofessional, including the misspelling of our names via chat, not being helpful in situations where we would expect them to be forthcoming.
- We believe it is fair to say that no customer paying good money at a hotel enjoys to hear a waiter tell you ""as I have told you before, ..."", so it feels that some of the staff may not be trained to qualify to work at the level you would expect for a 5-star hotel.
Again, we don't mean to be harsh, as the overall experience at this hotel always leaves great memories, and we genuinely want to give feedback that helps the hotel get the reputation and the staff it deserves.
Looking forward to our next stay!",5,2019,02,10
120,Never Treated So Well,"My father and I stayed with you over the Xmas and NYE holiday and we could not have been happier. Upon arrival, Angelo greeted us and was wonderful! He made check in easy and was always welcoming when we saw him. The concierge helped us many times with travel advice and details. The staff in the Executive Lounge was always friendly and helpful. They would go out of their way to make you feel like royalty. The rooms were large and comfortable. The tubs are a little high and can be tough to get in and out of though. But sometimes, it is the little things. Waking up Xmas morning to find a stocking full of treat on our door was just excellent. Thank you so much for a wonderful stay!",5,2019,02,10
120,Fantastic London hotel,"My friends and I had the pleasure of staying in this beautiful hotel last October. This hotel is something special. We had twin rooms with access to the executive lounge for breakfast and evening drinks. It was lovely to have a relaxing breakfast with friends each morning with a range of options and there was a lovely chilled atmosphere in the evening, with a variety of drinks & snacks available. We had a meal one night in the Oxbo restaurant. I really enjoyed  it and the food  was cooked to perfection. The rooms are beautifully decorated, industrial chic, beds really luxurious and the shower was heavenly, really spacious. 

The staff of this hotel were so friendly and definitely went the extra mile to be helpful.  Staff in the executive lounge were  particularly helpful in relation to places to go and where to buy tickets for shows etc. This hotel is in a great location very near the Tate Modern and very easy to get around London with  tube station nearby. If I go back to London in the near future, I would definitely go back to this hotel.",5,2019,02,10
120,Fabulous Hotel in the Hilton Chain,"Just stayed her for one night. Husband is a diamond member and we was lucky to be upgraded to a suite and have access to the executive lounge. Out of all the Hiltons we have stayed at, this is one of the best. Immaculate, friendly team, gym and swimming pool and close to Southwark Tube and other amenities. Plus it was our wedding anniversary and came back from a show to find a lovely cake to celebrate! 5 star stay and will be returning! ",5,2019,02,10
120,Third visit - still a great hotel,"This is becoming our go-to hotel for trips down to London.  The location is second to none and the level of comfort is extremely high.  Definitely a cut above most other Hiltons.
We received an upgrade to a Deluxe room on the top floor with our Hilton Gold status, which was a nice perk.  Our room was spacious and the bed was exceedingly comfortable.  We even had a view across to St. Paul's Cathedral.  
Breakfast in the restaurant on both mornings was excellent, but service was a bit of an issue, with coffee cups sitting empty.
On our first night, we chose to eat in the Oxbo restaurant.  This was not as good as previously as the menu has morphed into a 'British tapas' style offering, which, whilst nice, was not as much to our preference as the old menu.  Our waiter could hardly speak English either, which is an area of the service needing attention.
We had drinks in the bar on two occasions, which were very enjoyable.  The happy hour is a good deal and since our last visit, the bar has 'de-hipsterised' somewhat, which was a welcome change!
Another great stay and we will definitely be back.",5,2019,02,10
120,Comfortable and welcoming hotel,"Hilton Bankside is my hotel of choice when I visit London. On my most recent visit it did not disappoint. The staff, as ever, were helpful and friendly, the room that we booked was comfortable and clean, and the breakfast was yummy, with a great choice. This is one of the best Hilton’s that I have stayed at and I look forward to staying there again. Recommended.",5,2019,02,09
120,"Beautiful hotel, great location, super service","One of the best Hiltons I've ever stayed at--service was amazing, the rooms are state of the art and beautiful, and location two blocks from the Tate can't be beat. Anything else you want is within a short and safe walk--shops, great restaurants, etc. The super thick windows allowed for a quiet room.  Shout-out to the bellmen and front desk--especially Angelo who remembered my name our entire stay.",5,2019,02,06
120,Good choice,"Stayed here 3 nights on business for a conference being held here. Clean and spacious room, the conference facilities very good, food nice especially for the number being catered for, overall a perfect choice. Only little things to not get 5 stars being not sure if stuff in minibar was free as no price list but nothing to say it was, room was very cold despite heating being turned up to 29 degrees and bathroom even colder which a large heated towel rail would have gone down a treat - I would still be more than happy to stay here again however!",4,2019,02,06
120,Excellent Hilton Hotel,"We stayed for one night in January as we had an early appointment at Guy's Hospital the following day.  The reception area is spacious and staffed with welcoming and friendly staff.  Our room was large and spotlessly clean with very comfortable beds, large TV and well-designed bathroom.  The only facility we used was the indoor pool, which was a good size and again, spotlessly clean.   Will certainly use this hotel again for future stays in London.",5,2019,02,05
120,Best Hilton Ever!,"We stayed for one-night over Christmas 2018 as we were going to the Ministry of Sound nearby. What a brilliant hotel!

Get yourself the Hilton Honors App and book a room. You can get ""lounge access"" and the Executive Lounge at this Hilton is fantastic, just like a swanky London club. For 3 hours every evening (5pm till 8pm) you get complimentary food and top-shelf beverages on-tap. Once you've made the most of that head to the hotel bar, an oasis of calm with high end furnishings.

Our room had two bathrooms, a large lounge and two massive TVs. It was all brand spanking new and very clean indeed.

In short - amazing.",5,2019,02,04
120,A hotel with personality! ,"We had a fabulous two day break at the Hilton Bankside. This hotel has real personality! We loved the lively bar and Oxbo restaurant with its quirky interior. Staff were always prepared to go the extra mile. The breakfast buffet was an absolute feast. On both mornings as we left breakfast we were offered a coffee to go which was a lovely touch. 
The room had a fresh modern interior with coffee and mini bar reflecting the latest food trends. 

The hotel is excellently located if you are interested in visiting the Tate modern, National portrait Gallery and National Gallery. 

We would love to return! ",5,2019,02,03
120,Best Hilton in London,"Best Hilton in London. Very Clean rooms, helpful staff. Good gym and swimming pool. Nice lounge, great breakfast. Close to jubilee line. Ask for high floor and junior suite, with a view. Can't fault it.",5,2019,01,30
120,Keep coming back...,"I have visited the Bankside now on maybe 6 occasions.
Each visit is of a consistently high standard. The staff are efficient and attentive without being overly fussy. Check in is always easy and bills are always correct.
Each room I have stayed in is comfortable and a good night sleep follows. 
Breakfast is a treat in the Oxbo restaurant, the lounge is always well stocked and a cheeky cocktail in the main bar is always welcome.
Looking forward to my next stay in June!",5,2019,01,29
120,Another excellent stay with excellent service,"Another year, another visit, and yet, same hotel!
We continue to love this hotel, and the people working there. Special mention for Juan Vasquez, welcoming us every day for breakfast and ensuring we would start our day the perfect way.
Rooms are large, quiet, clean and the quality of the big-big bed make us sleep in total confort.
Keep it that way for next year's visit.",5,2019,01,29
120,Best service in town ,"The staff is very welcoming and friendly and I wouldn’t book anywhere else. Compared to my other travels and the hotel’s I stay at the Hotel are above the rest!
Your staff is one of the most professional. Your Front Desk staff Erlanda is very courteous she  made our stay plesent and looked after us.  Breakfast was delicious, i will also like to say that Florin from breakfast looked after us and was very  professional.  Thank  you for  your hospitality, we will definetly return. 5* service and professionalism,  i will definetly recommend  
The hotel to all my friends!",5,2019,01,29
120,Sadly had to drop a star.,"I stay here two or three times each year - the staff are fantastic, executive lounge great, breakfast has a great selection, and the bar has a good buzz about it. However, they have a problem with smells in the bedrooms. I have had to move rooms three times in the past year or so. I can suffer a small hint of staleness in a room, but the times I’ve had to move the smells have been really horrendous. The windows don’t open in the rooms so the staff have no real way to fix the problem properly. Such a shame. If it had been a one-off then fine, but it’s just getting too much now, I have another trip booked for March and sadly it could be my last. I have another 4 London trips planned for this year and I think I will have to look for a better Hilton.",4,2019,01,28
120,"Kevin, Jane & Friends Thursday night treat","Nice hotel, well positioned with plenty of facilities. Rooms were clean, well appointed and spacious. Breakfast was first rate, the selection wide, quality high and portion sizes generous. The bar area was large, well served and priced reasonably given the location. ",5,2019,01,28
120,Maybe the best Hilton in London ??,"We stayed here for a weekend getaway and we could not have picked a better place to stay. First of all the neighborhood is lively and many things are within walking distance (including the excellent Borough Market). Tate Modern is literally across the street and there are plenty of fun restaurants and bars around. The tube is also not too far away with only a few minutes walk.
The only negative of entire stay was during check-in. Apparently a lot of new employees have recently started and some are not well informed. The lady insisted for instance that gold members were not entitled to breakfast and that only diamond members received this benefit in this hotel. She was quite insistent that we would have to pay for it and I just asked her to check. She promised to do so but never came back. Breakfast was of course included as a “my way” benefit and we were guided to our table in the morning without any further question raised.
Fortunately, after this everything went as it should be. The hotel’s public spaces are modern and well designed. The same goes for the room. The bed was excellent, the bathroom clean and also well laid out with a large walk in rain shower. It shows that the hotel is relatively new and everything is still in excellent condition. There were some remarks about the lack of natural daylight in other reviews and although it is true that the windows are limited in size, it is not disturbing and the room lightning is more than adequate. 
Sound insulation is good and the AC does what you want (we do not like warm rooms to sleep in)
We spent some time at the bar which was always quite crowded and the staff know their business. Cocktails are excellent and for London standards normally priced.
We also had dinner once in the Oxbow restaurant and this was also a positive experience.
Breakfast offers a large selection and is what you would expect from a 5 star hotel.
The hotel also offers a pool and fitness area but we did not use it this time.
All in all, we had a truly excellent stay. I have been to other Hilton chain hotels in London and this is by far the best one up until now. It is rated 5 star and that is also what it delivers !",5,2019,01,28
120,Outstanding Hilton Hotel,My partner and I have visited London on business many times over the past 15 years and this was by far the best hotel we've stayed at in London. The service was outstanding. The hotel design beautiful. Guest room very comfortable. There was not a single problem or downside. The location is great next to Tate Modern. Overall fantastic experience.,5,2019,01,27
120,Saturday Brunch,"From when you enter Bankside and you’re at the cloakroom you get to enjoy a little banter with the staff members who are very engaging. 
This was my 3rd visit to enjoy brunch and it keeps getting better. Great music. Huge selection of food. I feel like it’s better to visit on a Saturday than a Sunday.  
We were lucky to have Dylan Hieu waiting on us and making sure we had a good afternoon.  We loved Dylan and we hope to see him again on our next visit.",5,2019,01,27
120,A gem in Bankside,"Being a Hilton Diamond member, I can not find any fault with this property. The rooms are bright, generously sized, clean and with very comfortable beds. The check in staff is very friendly and courteous. This has been my second stay at this property and I will surely stay again next time when in Bankside.",5,2019,01,27
120,Getting spoiled this trip ,"I booked this property for location and because it has a club lounge

I jus missed Diamond again for this year but the check in agent was kind enough to upgrade me for access - I had to wait for my room but it was really no issue as I had dinner and she was kind enough to deliver my key to the restaurant.

- food pretty good
- breakfast - it’s really rare to find a chef that can actually make great scrambled eggs, truly fantastic - I would return for these alone 
- great lounge with friendly staff and good wifi, I wanted access as I had a ton of work to catch up on and these were lovely surroundings to do it on today
- pool - really unusual to find a decent pool you can actually do lengths in
- room, great to have a ‘kill switch by the bed’ - please ask turndown staff not to turn on the one   Bedside light it down at work with though- really annoying when falling asleep
- very comfy beds and nice bedding

It’s a great new property I really had no expectations of, stay here you won’t be sorry

Rob",5,2019,01,26
120,Superb !! Wonderful stay and such lovely staff.,I cannot recommend this hotel more highly. We were celebrating my mum’s 60th birthday and I could not have made a better choice. The staff were all so kind and accommodating. A special mention to Alvaro who helped us with our transport arrangements. Such a nice man. Our room was clean and comfortable and the beds made it a struggle to make it to the marvellous breakfast where we were delighted with the service provided by our waiter Dylan. I want to say a personal thank you to all the staff at Bankside for making my Mum and I feel so welcome on such a special occasion.,5,2019,01,26
120,Comfortable and clean hotel,"Location is great, near great places for food and near many great places to visit.

As a diamond status, hotel was nice enough to upgrade my room. Busy hotel, but they were able to accommodate as the room change. Natasha at the front desk was very efficient and was able to work out some issues. Good front desk staff, but they should smile bit more😄
Room was clean, comfortable bed and very quiet with good amenities.
Lounge was excellent with very friendly service and good food/drinks.
Restaurant was a huge disappointment, food was good, but somewhat tasteless. For person traveling from other country, sometime simple local food would be good, but not sure who they were catering to. Bar was good with lots of good choices, but again bit more traditional choices would be great.

Overall, I highly recommend this hotel and I will stay at this hotel again. 

",5,2019,01,26
120,Great Location & Staff Perfect ,"If you are searching comfort, cleanness, good location and staff efficient Hilton Bankside London can offer a pleasant stay. It’s not cheap but is worthy if you wanna stay some steps from Tate Modern. Don’t forget the breakfast.",4,2019,01,26
120,Excellent service,"Excellent service from beginning to end. John the head concierge was extremely helpful in advice on where and when to visit sites and help with planning activities. Our favorite waiter Dylan H. hooked us up with the best coffee’s- cappuccino, flat white, double shot and even a coffee to go that rivaled that of the cafes. And our room was CLEAN - Clara made sure our bed was turned down, the water and complimentary lemonade and cookies were stocked, and we had extra shampoo and towels.  Not all Hilton’s are the same- I’ve had good experiences in Turkey and bad experiences in Egypt but this is one of the best ones. Usually I’d say something was good and not mention names but the staff here deserves a personal shout out because they remember you and they took care of us like family.  Highly recommend and would stay here again- great location to walk to many attractions.",5,2019,01,26
120,Still Our Favorite Hilton,"We stayed here for 2 nights this time.  This was our 4th visit.  It's still fantastic with great service, friendly people, and with everything very clean and working efficiently.  There were a few minor issues.  The free mini-bar had nothing in it worthwhile except water.  They've gone green, and it mainly had bird food type snacks and healthy drinks.  Our last stay, my main issue with the fridge was getting only diet soft drinks vs. a variety of such, but this time, there were no soft drinks?? Also, no chocolate or other decent snacks.  When I'm on vacation, I want good stuff!  In the lounge, I've always said how wonderful it is that they stock diet tonic so I can have gin and tonics without worrying about sugar issues.  This time, the first night, they had diet tonic but only a few mixed in with all the regular ones and hard to find without taking 10 bottles out of the fridge each time!  The second night after I said something, they were easier to reach.  The main bathroom door had a broken handle that would come off on the bedroom side, but when I mentioned it to the front desk, this was resolved while we were out for lunch so great service there as well as my request to have room cleaned while we knew we would be out for a couple of hours having the best fish & chips in town at the Prince of Wales about a 15 minute walk away. Due to our HiltonHonors Diamond status, we received the best room upgrade ever here to a 2 room suite with one and half baths:  a toilet and sink, plus full bath with separate tub and shower.
The bed was too soft as well as the pillows so I got the worst 2 night's sleep on this entire 11 night/ 8 hotel trip.  This room, at least but not sure about maybe others, needs at least a few firm pillows and a harder mattress.   The restaurant for breakfast is yummy with eggs made to order and so much more and opens at 6:30, which was convenient for us on the last day as we had a mid-morning flight from Gatwick.  On prior visits, we've taken the train to/from Blackfriars for Gatwick, but this time we had to take a bus to London Bridge station to get the connection due to rail work.  It was actually easier with the bus.  I highly recommend that all tourists get an Oyster Card.  It works on most London transportation, including the trains to and from Gatwick, and never expires-that is the balance which can be easily reloaded at any train station machine with credit card, never goes away except with usage and has a daily max for local transport all over central London at no more than about 7 quid a day!   But again about the Hilton London Bankside, it is the place to stay in London for high quality service at about half the price than the Hyde Park area.  It's still our #1 go to place in London!  Thanks again.",5,2019,01,23
120,Fantastic service and building ,"The swimming pool is wow, long enough for a good swimming....
Food at the restaurant is omg... I loved the homemade bread... but also the stake was fab.... 
staff, extremely polite and helpful and kind and and and .... 
definitely a place to recommend ",5,2019,01,22
120,"Great Stay at the London Bankside, highly recommended","We stayed here overnight whilst meeting up with family in London.  The hotel is lovely, rooms very spacious for London with everything you need and very well designed, the bathroom was gorgeous.  Check in staff and the concierge were very helpful and friendly.  Would definitely stay again, this may be my new favourite for a London stay.  ",5,2019,01,21
120,Best Hilton in London,"Every stay at the bankside is always a pleasure. I'm diamond and before checking in I called up and asked if they had a suite for an upgrade, they had one left and very kindly upgraded me to a 7th floor suite with a lovely view. The exec lounge is fantastic, the canapes are delicious and they have a great drubis selection. 

The staff are wonderful and really make the hotel feel like home.",5,2019,01,20
120,Hospitality PLUS!!,Truly felt at home in this comfortable Hilton. Every detail from the dining to the bar to the comfortable rooms-  it’s all there!   Would go back without a doubt.  Suman Poudel and Juan Vasquez along with their staff went above and beyond- treating us like family!,5,2019,01,19
120,Excellent,"Arrived late in the evening at the hotel, check-in was a breeze! Went to my room and it was so clean, large and the bathroom was lovely! Went to the bar for a drink with my colleagues and the finger food was delicious. Great selection of beer as well, staff were exceptionally helpful. The level of service was excellent, cannot thank the staff enough and the location is very central for walking and seeing sights. Thoroughly recommend. ",5,2019,01,19
120,Hilton Bankside and OXBO Distillery - Excellent,Suman Poudal and the staff of the OXBO Distillery were extremely helpful and made my family’s stay memorable and one of the best holidays we’ve experienced.  The professionalism of the hotel staff and cleanliness and quality of the accommodations was exceptional.,5,2019,01,17
120,A wonderful break in the city,"My daughter choose to visit London with me to jointly celebrate our birthdays. She wanted a hotel with a pool which is how I discovered this hotel. We arrived late but the reception staff were welcoming and attentive to my daughter. The room itself (which I had pre-booked on line) was spacious and comfortable. It had everything we needed and was extremely well designed and cleaned. The staff had also organised for a chocolate brownie and Happy Birthday plate to be left in our room on arrival - a very nice gesture. We swam every morning and enjoyed the long swimming pool. There was also a jacuzzi at one end of the pool but as it shared the pool water it was tepid rather than hot tub. The changing facilities in the leisure area were very good.
Breakfast is amazing here. I've been to some very fancy five star hotels and this one could definitely give them a run for their money. Absolutely everything you could want was there and it all tasted delicious. Finally the children's fox hunt was a fun activity to do and my daughter loved her prize. Thank you to the team for making our stay so pleasant and memorable. We hope to return soon.",5,2019,01,17
120,Business,"I stay here a lot for business and it never fails to provide an excellent service. I introduced it to some of my friends and their children. The 2 comments that the children made were 1 Fantastic breakfast 2 comfortable beds. 2 important things for children.

I would recommend upgrading to executive for the afternoon tea, evening drinks and canapés.",5,2019,01,17
120,"Comfortable rooms, great service","We stayed two nights in Jan '19. Rooms were very clean, incredibly comfortable beds, clean and contemporary bathrooms. Great complimentary minibar. Excellent hair dryers. The hotel is wonderful; the decor throughout is stylishly elegant and whimsical. The concierge was fantastic, he greeted us warmly on arrival and arranged car service to airport for us. The executive lounge is very comfortable (we liked the fireplace and having tv w/news and sports games) with fantastic service from the staff and great breakfast, tea, and happy hour amenities. We also enjoyed the restaurant, and the great gin and tonics at the bar. It felt like a five star hotel, and we didn't even make it to the spa or pool. The Tate Modern is just around the corner. I would definitely stay here again, for business or leisure. Thanks to the staff for a lovely stay enjoyed by our whole family.",5,2019,01,15
120,Upscale Hilton business style hotel,"I have mixed feelings about this hotel. On one side it's the best Hilton in town. The cleanest of all. The best maintained with touches like turndown service that I thought long gone down the East road of cost cuttings in this hotel category. Same for the free mini bar in executive room. There's even someone opening the taxindoor and helping you with your suitcase. At one point I really was wondering big this was a Hilton! Then, On the other side, it was time for check in and I realized that I was in a Hilton and not some sort of small modern luxury hotel. Being a gold card holder I asked about upgrade and late (14:00) check out. The attendant was embarrassed and could not respond. Called a ""supervisor"". She was a blunt ""computer says no"" inflexible kind of person and sense of costumer service. Reason? Hotel fully booked. Christmas period. Very busy. Jr suite upgrade? Computer says no: we don't upgrade gold to rooms above executive room (category I had booked as in the ""you always lose"" lottery for gold upgrades I've learned that one better book the room one really wishes to stay in). Hopefully, on the next day a more constumer friendly front desk attendant allowed me to check out at 13:30. 

Checking in online can be really challenging as the hotel design has made room shapes odd and one can end up choosing a room with a ""nice"" view to an inner wall or another room. My room was nice though rather dark even with a street view. 

The lounge is big and rather nice and chic though it looks better in picture as there's a certain lack of cosiness. The high ceiling can make it a noisy place especially when there are kids running around. The staff is nice too but tend to be over friendly and attentive with regulars and ignoring new comers... Breakfast offering is the usual carbs and carbs, fruits, yogurts and eggs any style on order (which is a very cool feature).

the neighborhood is good with the Tate modern just right next door. Lots of food options around too. But remember it's not convent garden of any other kind of super lively neighborhood. It's quiet. 

In conclusion, despite some of the usual hotel chain staff attitude, I was impressed by the Hilton bankside and I'll probably return. Yes there's room for improvement but the smiling staff (especially housekeeping) makes me think they're happy to work there because they're treated well. Happy staff means better service means happy guests!",4,2019,01,15
120,Great stay,"We stayed here for 4 night's over a long weekend.  Got a very reasonable  rate for such a high standard hotel. Booked directly on a b and b rate.The delicious  breakfast choices both hot and cold  are hugely varied.We were looked after well  by Dylan in the dining room.
Room and bathroom spotless and modern.
The pool is great, just the place to ease aching muscles after sightseeing , for which the hotel is ideally placed being a stonesthrow from the Millennium  bridge and Southwark  tube station.
The bar is buzzing with happy hours between 4 and 6 pm with buy  one get one free. Reasonable prices for  a London city centre  bar.Thanks to Vladamir for his great service.
All in all thoroughly  recommended",5,2019,01,15
120,Superior is every way,"In a city with plenty options, this hotel stands apart. Everything you expect from a Hilton and then some. Great specious and well fitted rooms. 

Excellent service from the Executive Lounge, check in staff are friendly and efficient and breakfast staff are wonderful. 

It is very strategically located and within a 5 mins walk to a tube. There are many dining options in the hotel or within a 5 minute walk. 

Definitely staying there again. 

",5,2019,01,14
120,Excellent,"Excellent service and friendly staff. The breakfast was great, the room was spotless and the swimming pool was a bonus. Can't find anything wrong with this hotel. Just over one mile walk to the West End theatres. We will definitely book it again next time.",5,2019,01,13
120,A great hotel spoiled by check in staff,"Stayed here over the Christmas period. From the moment we approached check in things went pear shaped.
We were greeted by an efficient check in lady, not hugely welcoming but efficient all the same. We had booked 3 separate reservations for our 3 day stay, this seemed to cause an issue.
My wife was bluntly and rudely asked 'whats your name'? Clearly forgetting that as an honors member, wives and girlfriends do not have to be declared. My wife commented the check in lady made her feel like a criminal and had done something wrong. That was totally unacceptable.
We were allocated a room, no upgrade was offered, we had booked a king deluxe room. The room we were shown to was very poor. Tiny and cramped and nothing like the usual king deluxe rooms we have experienced previously.  As it turned out, the room we were given was not in fact a king deluxe room more a standard room.
After saying we were not all happy and wanted yo transfer to another Hilton, as the room did not even have a bath we were then magically offered an upgrade to a suite! Something that the level of membership I hold says will happen based on availability. It clearly was available but not offered to me until I complained. I wonder why.....
The hotel itself, despite its somewhat bizarre side street location was a delight!
The restaurant and its staff on Christmas day were nothing short of fantastic and deserve enormous credit for the standard of care they provided! Superb!
On checking out however, we were again attended by another surly character, she did not ask if we enjoyed our stay, nor did she smile. Just like check in, my wife felt she was rude and unpleasant and particularly when I queried our bill. 
We will not return to Bankside despite how good the actual hotel was.
The check in staff there need to realise customers are not a pain they have to tolerate, do not appreciate being interrogated and ask nothing more than some basic courtesy. 
Something Hilton Bankside check in staff clearly havent grasped!
Utterly shameful way to treat paying guests!!",3,2019,01,13
120,One of the best UK Hiltons,"We arrived quite late at night and found the valet parking a bit frustrating - due to their seemingly being only 1 person managing it, with 3 cars to deal with and very little space. 
I was tired after a long journey so didn’t really appreciate the confusion at a check-in, but that was my own fault as I had forgotten that I had checked in already through the app!  The lobby area was amazingly decorated and very festive.  The deluxe room, while small, was really great - spotlessly clean, well-equipped, with a nice view and a very comfortable bed.  Service over the stay was exemplary...efficient, warm and friendly.  Breakfast was also excellent.  Great location as well, as it is a very short walk to the river, the Tate etc and close enough to the tube to make getting around easy.  Actually one of my best UK Hilton experiences ever.",5,2019,01,12
120,"Still good, however...","We stayed four nights in January and this was our second stay at the location.

Everything was just as good as before but as highlighted in my previous review, the design isn't great for those wishing to use a hair curled etc. or put on make-up. My wife pointed this out and have to agree.

Comfy beds, clean room in good condition, friendly staff and a decent executive lounge, relaxing pool area and very quiet even with the hustle of the city outside. Close to many restaurants and shops for everything you might need. Breakfast was only 'ok' and the hot items could be improved, cooked in smaller batches to keep them in best condition but it does cater to many nationalities.

Gripe is that as a Diamond member you should get a suite upgrade, subject to availability which we were told there were none. I checked online and there were several, also the review just before mine mentions same and they were upgraded to a suite before arrival. Don't appreciate being told porky pies. I am sitting on the roof terrace of Melia Torremolinos writing this, just above my suite (upgrade)... sour grapes I know.

Will stay again but hope to be welcomed as per membership level.",4,2019,01,12
120,Great hotel,"Great hotel. Excellent location. We had a very pleasant stay. Near a lot of things to do. Homely feeling . Excellent service. Just one downside , returning deposit takes far too long. In these modern times it should not be too difficult to push a button one or two days after leaving. ",4,2019,01,10
120,Should have been a five star let down by basic organisation,"Many positives about this hotel. Excellent location, a really decent bar and huge restaurant. The rooms are excellent too and well looked after. The breakfast was exceptional. For Central London too the prices are reasonable.

My main issue was their failure to address my feather allergy. I put down on the initial booking I was allergic to feather so would need foam pillows. I emailed the hotel the morning too and it was confirmed by the management. However when I arrived to check in the room had feather and the receptionist had to phone around to resolve which resulted in us waiting around in reception. This has happened before at less reputable places which is why I always double check so was very surprised this happened in a Hilton. Started the stay on a very sour note and so avoidable.",4,2019,01,08
120,Excellent stay. Beautiful suite - will return! ,"We were upgraded ahead of our stay to a beautiful one bed deluxe suite overlooking the Shard as Diamond members. The room was huge and had really nice little touches like complimentary mini bar. We were also able to request a child bath amenity kit (with a teddy bear which my kid loved!) using the Hilton app. The hotel even sent us a delicious chocolate cake to celebrate our wedding anniversary! Late check request was also granted over the Messaging function in the Hilton app. Excellent service from everyone we met with smiles all round! 

The food quality in the executive lounge was excellent. Beautiful cakes during afternoon tea and free flow of sparkling wine during the evening happy hour. 

Overall excellent stay so well done to Kim, Cristina and the rest of the Bankside team. We will return! ",5,2019,01,06
120,Very good indeed,"Hilton Hotels can be a bit, well, corporate. Anonymously competent but lacking the personal touch. Not so with this (relatively) new build. in a very good location and with excellent facilities. Main asset is the staff who have been unfailingly excellent and friendly. 

Strongly recommended.",5,2019,01,06
120,Wee gem! ,"First time here in this new hotel. Near Tate Modern & 5 mins from Underground. As Diamond member access to Executive Lounge & one of the best we’ve stayed in. Large lounge well furnished. Beautiful afternoon tea quickly followed by evening canapés of smoked salmon, prawns, cold meats, etc & lovely wine. Staff helpful & pleasant. We’ll be back! ",5,2019,01,04
120,Can't think of a complaint,"Stayed for 3 nights over Christmas and had a wonderful stay. In fact, I can't really think of anything negative to say about the hotel.

The hotel is new and well appointed. We were happy with our entry-level room. It was a reasonable-to-good size (for London) and had all the amenities you would expect of a 5-star hotel (except an iron). There was no minibar, but there was an empty fridge, which was even better considering there was a Tesco across the street and a Sainsbury's two doors down.

We had the buffet breakfast at the hotel and it had a great selection and the food was good quality. The hotel gym was adequate (not the best, but good enough for a few days). There is a large underground pool too which we saw, but did not use.

The hotel location was really good - it was a close walking distance to Southwark station, or a short stroll over the Millennium bridge to be in the very centre of the city.

Considering the great room rate that we got (US$200) per night, including breakfast at a brand-new five star hotel, and early check in when we arrived at 8am, I have no reservation in recommending the Hilton Bankside.",5,2019,01,03
120,Excellent Hotel,"After spending more than 200 nights at the Hilton London Bankside, I still enjoy every stay i spent at this place. It has a great location, great facilities and especially great staff. One of the best Hilton places worldwide.",5,2019,01,03
120,Excellent Hotel & Staff,"The hotel is very unassuming when you look at the building and location. However, the service is definitely 5-star.  What makes this hotel special is the staff. Everyone at the hotel was very friendly and helpful. Excellent executive lounge.",5,2019,01,03
120,One of the best!,"We had a great stay and most of this is due to the people working there, doing the best for the travellers. 4/5 stars because the room had no view, no possibility to open a window for fresh air as the ventilation was not very efficient (bad thermostat maybe, indicating wrong temperatures) and there was no bathtub, only stand up shower. Great breakfast and nice atmosphere in the restaurant, with cordial and hospitable waiters. Good occasion again to mention and thank  the entire staff for the good work they are doing. The location of the hotel is excellent, few steps from Tate Modern (added a picture of the hotel taken from one of the museum's windows) and half a mile to the unique Borough Market.",4,2019,01,03
120,Great location and excellent hotel.,We enjoyed the location of this hotel.  A  small walk to the southbank boardwalk we found it to be away from all the hustle and bustle but still close to restaurant and shopping.  The hotel made us feel welcome and even left a small Christmas gift the morning of.  The staff were friendly and the rooms very comfortable.   ,5,2019,01,02
120,New year eve stay,"Stayed at this Hotel for nye hotel is in a great area for Borough market an areas around London Eye
The hotel is spotless and well looked after , staff lovely and welcoming, we had king room with had a massive comfy bed and bathroom with large shower , staff helped my wife out when she lost earring in sink which they retrieved thanks to maintenance man , the only complaint we had was in happy hour 4-6 the offer of buy 1 drink and second drink 1p in the oxbo bar my wife and me had 2 gin and tonics and was shocked with the bill manager did sort but we did feel it wasn’t explanatory how they got the prices on the bill , staff do need to be told it’s not really buy 1 and second for a 1p apart from that we enjoyed our stay , will return sometime",4,2019,01,02
120,Family London Trip,"A great hotel with over the top service. Being a Hilton Gold member allowed us to check in at 10 am after an overnight flight and our rooms were upgraded as well. The breakfast buffet, included for Hilton Gold members, was fantastic and had lots of options. They even allowed us to eat at the buffet Xmas morning even though our stay didn’t officially begin until that afternoon. The bar that’s attached is good for a night cap. 

The rooms were spacious and clean. Very comfortable beds and the shower was great. Turn down service is always nice to come back to after a long day. The only room issues we had was the TV was glitchy, the lighting could be better, and our tissue box wasn’t refilled one night. 

A little far from the main attractions of London but was able to Uber everywhere across the Thames for about 10-15 pounds. 

The staff couldn’t have been nicer and always answered our questions. I would definitely stay here again! ",5,2019,01,01
120,Pre Christmas stay,"Our London Hilton hotel of choice when visiting as we consider it good value with, in my opinion, the best executive lounge on offer. Warmly welcomed at check in and our room was well appointed, clean and comfortable. Lounge for evening drinks and nibbles and breakfast all good. I prefer to the more expensive Park Lane Hilton as it has a more intimate feel. No issues at all. (Missed the giant Nutcrackers outside this year! Hope they are only in storage).",5,2018,12,31
120,Worst Beds,"Not good at all and please try to improve service, else people would start feeling bad about the expensive hotels like Hilton is. I was recommend about this hotel by a friend who owns few Marriotts in North America and he was also not happy after what I received.",2,2018,12,30
120,Customer orientation lacks completely,"We have been loyal to Hilton Park Lane and the Mondrian for years, but we were really happy when we found an equally nice yet less expensive hotel in our favorite area- the Hilton London Bankside. As avid travelers and as HH Gold we stay at a dozen hotels per year. Initially we felt the Hilton LB met all our requirements for a perfect stay- some small imperfections were on the account of this then being a new hotel. We even chose to have the night there when getting married, that’s how much we liked it. 

My husband got us this little two-night getaway between Christmas and New Years to escape kids, cooking and just relax. However this time we were not happy with our stay. We got our first room staring into a brick wall. Barely any daylight. The air in the room was not satisfactory, I guess the air con did not work the way it should. And here you cannot open windows so imagine the stuffiness. We got a new room. Smaller than the previous one, but at least with daylight. Only here you could not have curtains open without being on display for the facing windows- all Hilton hotel rooms. Anyways- minor problem. The real problem started when we- exhausted after a long day went to bed and turned off the lights. This constant “dripping” sound. Like one raindrop would hit the window with short intervals. Or a leakage on the floor above. But the weird thing is that it almost disappeared when lights were on. So instead of being annoyed we tried to sleep with lights on. We were getting up early next day so sleep was crucial to us. 
After a while of almost losing all sanity we had to surrender and call to solve the problem. A technician came up, acknowledging the sound saying it was the LED lights but could not solve the problem right then and there. So we had to pack all our stuff in the middle of the night and switch rooms again. 
Not much left of the night- but finally in bed in our new room, the sound was still there. At first I was afraid to say anything, thinking it was all in my head. But I started laughing and my husband instantly said he heard it too. We could not bear the thought of moving again. We called down to the front desk and they brought earplugs and sleeping mask. I have never been able to sleep with earplugs, so this did not work. 

2 hours later the sound disappeared and I got 2 hrs of sleep. We went down to the reception expecting them to not charge us for that night, but they only knocked off 30 pounds and giving us a very small room service charge off the bill. So we still paid 100 pounds for no sleep at all. It was a nightmare of a night- and the front desk person just topped that off by having no interest in making us happy. I am so sad to have had that experience. We travel to London a lot and we were so sure we had found “our hotel”. Sadly it will not be our preferred choice next time. 
As I can see from other reviews, this seems to be a problem at the Hilton London Bankside that HH members are not recognized, and also that there is a lack of customer orientation. Maybe the management need to look into this in order to secure the profits for this hotel in coming years. ",1,2018,12,30
120,Couldn't ask for better,"Absolutely loved the hotel. Arriving six hours early, I was impressed I was offered a room and could check-in. Having a shower and freshening-up made all the difference after arriving off a long international flight. The fit out and quality of both the room and hotel was impressive. Every modern convenience, quiet rooms, comfortable beds and well-appointed amenities. The only thing missing was an iron but I'm sure they could've fetched one had I asked. In the mornings the breakfast was equally knock-out with copious amounts of traditional English and European foods on offer. The level of attention of the waitstaff was the best I've ever experienced; although possibly a little too attentive in that as soon as a plate was finished, they were over to clear it. Might sound a little petty but you felt as if people were watching your every move. On the whole I couldn't fault the hotel - it exceeded expectations and I'd be back in a flash. The location is also very conveniently situated within minutes walk of the tube.",5,2018,12,27
120,Great location and wonderful staff,We had 3 nights at this lovely hotel.  The room was great and this has to be the most comfortable bed ever!  The location was also very good.  The most outstanding thing about this hotel has to be the staff.  We were greeted like long lost friends every time we returned to the hotel.  A special thank you to Mark Kis for whom no problem was too large.  He made our stay trouble free.,5,2018,12,26
120,Executive Lounge,"Really nice hotel and amazing customer service. 

Rebecca (Executive Lounge) was so friendly and kind with us. 

High quality room and very clean swimming pool. Delicious breakfast.

I would definitely come back.",5,2018,12,26
120,Excellent stay - disappointing response to problem with visit,"I'm of two minds about this hotel. First the good - it is stunning, if a little hard to find (kind of hidden down a narrow street), and we had good communication from hotel staff prior to our stay and service while we were there (mostly making local calls and calls upstairs). We arrived early after a red-eye flight from the US and had five rooms reserved - we were offered an accessible room for my parents and early check-in which was very appreciated. The rooms were superior quality, space and modernity. No frills (usual shampoo etc) but great layout and all easy to use. Definitely the largest rooms on our stay (we used three hotels in two cities in England). There was a nice amount of holiday decorations and Christmas jumpers on staff were fun. The location, which made us a little nervous as being away from central London, was actually outstanding. We were within a long walk, short Uber to Borough Market, short walk to the Tate Modern, and with a Sainsbury Local and Tesco (small city grocers) and Costa (coffee) next door to the hotel. Don't bother with breakfast at the hotel or the minibar - fresh coffee, pastries, fruit, yogurt and soda, liquor and snacks right next door. 
The only negative was the hotel response to a terrible issue we had that made us need to cancel a non-refundable room at the last minute. My dd (who is 20 and in college) didn't realize that her passport had expired the week we were supposed to travel. She and my dh stayed behind in Boston to renew the passport. The cost to re-book the flights alone was over $5,000 (expensive lesson for all of us). We didn't expect to recoup the cost of the room, but we were hopeful that the hotel would offer something for our trouble. As we are Hilton Honors members rewards points, a Hilton room credit for a future night (even at the same hotel - one of our kids goes to college at Oxford), or even vouchers for breakfast or the bar would have been a nice gesture, particularly considering that we were booked into so many rooms. Very disappointing to be treated with a shrug of the shoulders, not even any sympathy for a situation that was still unfolding in the US at that point. A little chilly.",4,2018,12,25
120,Excellent hotel!,"We really enjoyed our experience at the Hilton Bankside. The room was fantastic, the hotel staff were excellent, and the breakfast was wonderful too. The beds are extremely comfortable with heavy comforters and great pillows. The shower was great too. Lots of lighting throughout the room and lots of power/usb outlets. Wish we could have tried the bar. It looked great. We also saw many people going to and from the pool during the winter time so it must be great. ",5,2018,12,25
120,Not sure how it got 5 stars!,"First the good: The rooms are comfortable and roomy enough for a longer stay. Bathroom, especially the shower, is great. Bar and restaurant are nice, but food wasn't great, and service was just ok. Bad: They are so cheap it hurts! An upgrade to Deluxe room, for 15 to 25 pounds sterling a night---it gets you two free sodas every day! Don't get suckered! Breakfast is nice and extensive, but not worth 25 pounds...Also, NO amenities other than cheap shampoo, conditioner, and body wash. You have to call and ask for a Q-tip, makeup removal pad, shower cap...everything! I assume the 5th star comes from the turnover service, but these folks really need to up their game in terms of providing luxury or great service. You can tell they're trying to squeeze out every penny. ",3,2018,12,25
120,Excellent stay in London,"This hotel largely met our expectations. 

The interior design is tasteful with a « boutique » feel.

Very nice and spacious bathroom.The installation are very nice. Everything is perfectly clean. 

The staff is very friendly and helpful.

The location is great no matter how you like to go around London.

I wholeheartedly recommend !",5,2018,12,24
120,Great place to stay,"Go here to stay. 10 out of 10 on everything. Worth every penny. Lounge, staff, lobby, room, food, and location all spot on. Will stay there again next time we visit. Already looking at dates to stay there again.",5,2018,12,21
120,Amazing!!,"My partner and I stayed here on 22/11/2018. Little did I know that I was going to spend the night here as an ENGAGED couple!! My partner booked here as a surprise because he had planned to propose to me. So, we arrived at the hotel around lunch time to drop off our bags but the lady on the desk told us our room was ready for us straight away. Room is basic but with a bed so comfy that I didn’t want to leave it. Bathroom was lovely and clean with a big shower. The staff are so brilliant and will go above and beyond to make sure your stay is the best. The breakfast was absolutely amazing. So many things to choose from. What stood out for me was the lovely, attentive chef at the breakfast bar who asks how you’d like your eggs cooked. He was great! Everything my partner and I ate, we loved. We enjoyed every minute of our stay and would 100% return in the future!",5,2018,12,21
120,Worthy of its 5* rating,"What a fabulous experience, from start to finish. The hotel is immaculate, public spaces chic and modern and the rooms are outstanding. Room service menu good and service can not be faulted. I would love to know what the duvet was - I would like to buy one for myself. We don’t have a bad word to say about our stay - fabulous. Few places are true 5* experiences but this is one. Well done all. ",5,2018,12,21
120,"Lovely hotel,  would stay here again ","Super friendly and helpful staff!  Rooms were a great size, and they actually had foam pillows put in there for me before check in! (I always request them with my booking,  almost never get them). Easy 10 min walk to a couple different underground lines, great exec lounge and a good hearty breakfast. Would definitely stay here again.",5,2018,12,20
120,Quiet and comfortable sleeping quarters,"First, the hotel is a bit removed from ""Tourist London"", but it is just a short walk to the Southwark Tube Station, so it might be a good economical base if a hotel in central London is not on your ""bucket list"".  The area is a strange mix of office buildings and residential areas, but it has a good variety of restaurants, and it is relatively quiet at night.  I stayed there on a Friday night when the bar was quite busy with the staff from the surrounding buildings celebrating the end of the week, but the hotel restaurant had plenty of free tables.  The bedroom was compact,  but definitely not absurdly so, and the bed was very comfortable. The bedroom was clean and the bathroom amenities were fine. The hotel represents extremely good value for money for those who are prepared to be a little outside central London's action.",4,2018,12,19
120,Christmas holiday at the Hilton Bankside,"My husband and I had a great stay at the Hilton London’s Bankside. Granted it is a bit far from most of the action, but it’s a gorgeous hotel. Our room was perfect, bathroom beautiful, and the hotel lobby was decorated brilliantly for the holiday. We loved every minute of our stay! Thanks so much for a lovely time!",5,2018,12,17
120,Bottomless Brunch - OMG,"The food was amazing, the Prossecco really was bottomless and the staff excellent.  Yummy.  Great value for money at £45 per head for 2 hours.   Restaurant very comfortable and the hotel reception looked so festive.",5,2018,12,17
120,Fabulous hotel,"It is my favourite hotel in the south of London. Always full :) very comforrable beds. I sleep like a baby. Very profesional staff. Service at the executive lounge is perfect. Thank you all people working there. See you next year
",5,2018,12,17
120,Superb,"Stayed two nights over the weekend room was clean and bed was very comfortable, breakfast very good, bar prices good for London, staff very friendly, would not hesitate to visit again. Location was excellent.",5,2018,12,16
120,Finally big enough room in London :),"This Hilton is quite new hotel, located ""on the other side"" of Thames, but :
* just 5 minutes walk from nearest tube station
* quite and large (for London's standards) rooms
* decent breakfast buffet with wide vegetarian/vege/healthy options
* nice bar with live DJ (at least at Fridays)
So doesn't matter that this is ""on the other side"" :). The are also very nice restaurants in a walking distance from the hotel",4,2018,12,15
120,"Amazing Rooms, Amazing Staff, Epic Stay","People...it is the people that make all the difference in the world.  You expect the staff in the lobby and during the check-in process to be friendly and welcoming, and they absolutely were.  Where I found the difference in the hotel property was the Housekeeping Staff.  Every single encounter was so very pleasant, beyond any hotel I have stayed in the world.  The room was above-average size for London and they were totally spotless every single day.  There was not one hint of unclean anywhere in the room or the bathroom.  

This was my annual business trip and this hotel has my business for now forward.  After a very long day in the offices, coming back to a sparkling clean room is so refreshing.",5,2018,12,14
120,"Luxurious, unpretentious and very friendly hotel ","Absolutely love this hotel. The staff are very friendly and welcoming, nothing is too much trouble. The furnishings feel very new and modern. Bathrooms have incredible showers. The breakfast is great. Location fantastic. Valet parking service is brilliant - very rare to find for a central london hotel below £400 per night. We will definitely be staying again. ",5,2018,12,14
120,Great hotel in a really good location - highly recommended,"This Hilton is excellent. I spent three days here as part of a business trip and enjoyed it immensely. The hotel is South of the river but well situated for a quick walk over the bridges to business and other sites there. Access is great using the Jubilee Line Southwark tube station. The location is also good for local bars and restaurants and a short walk from the Tate Modern and St.Pauls.
Rooms in the hotel are fresh with very nice bathrooms, great beds and excellent pillows and linen. Wifi access was provided and throughput was good enough for work purposes.
Breakfast is served in the ground floor restaurant area ""Oxbo"" and is a comprehensive and great quality buffet or options for ordering from the menu. The range of food is impressive - 5 juices, a coffee station, full English items, continental breakfast, an entire stand of pastries and croissants and it goes on and on. Eggs can be order from a cooking station and they do a great omelette to order too. In the evening and at lunchtime the restaurant has a really good range of food and some good value set menus. There is also a second bar ""Distillery"" and its light restaurant menu is great too.
Staff are very friendly all times of day with many staff members in the lobby to assist and a very efficient doorman. Cleaning staff and the turn-down service were all excellent too. I didn't use them but I gather the pool and gym facilities are high quality too.",5,2018,12,12
120,"Hilton London Bankside - Great Hotel, couldn't be better!","We (family with 2 adults and two little children) now visit the hotel for the 3rd time within a year because we are very satisfied. For us as a family it is just perfect. It is very close to some great sights in London, such as Tower Bridge or The Shard London and also important train connections (tube) are within walking distance.
The hotel itself is really new and great. For us it was also decisive that there is an indoor pole. This is especially great for the children who can relax in the pool after a strenuous day out. 

Also, surely he breakfast buffet is a highlight in the London hotel scene. And it was very pleasant to find such well-kept and clean rooms.

We just wanted to thank Mrs. SABINA LA BRUNA once again. She really enabled us again a wonderful stay in the hotel. It was really great how she met us with our request. So she personally helped us to prepare wonderful days in London.

It is also marvelous how friendly, professional and above all attentive the hotel staff are. As a guest you can feel welcome at any time and at any occasion.

We felt very comfortable and we are very happy to come back. And we can recommend the Hilton Bankside to our friends and acquaintances.
",5,2018,12,12
120,Weekend break ,"Booked a suite and this hotel as it had a pool. Great welcome, pleasant spacious and clean room. Pool was was nice. The club lounge was comfortable with a good breakfast with adequate selection and the snacks and drinks in the evening were very good. Children were allowed in there and welcomed with colouring pens and books. We tried the restaurant, and no complaints on the food. Good service and friendly from the lady that helped us.
The tube station is 12 to 15 minutes walk away so we tendered to get taxis into the tourist areas and theatre. The area whilst not in the main part of the tourist routes is an ideal balance for a short break and would recommend this hotel ",5,2018,12,10
120,Great London Hilton property,"Stayed here recently for the first time and it won't be the last.  Having stayed at plenty of London based Hilton properties, I must say this is now one of my favourites.  The executive lounge is cosy and large, rooms nice and comfortable and I really enjoyed a swim in their pool. I will be coming back !",5,2018,12,09
120,Excellent hotel in every respect - good location,"Just what you expect from Hilton.

Had a great nights sleep thanks to the quality of the room/hotel (its quiet) and the beds, bedlinen and pillows.

Reception was swift and friendly.

Never used the restaurants or bars, but they looked nice and not overly busy (busy enough to have a vibe, not too busy to be annoying).",5,2018,12,09
120,Fun Night,"Visited the Hilton for an awards ceremony, very well organised and helpful staff. 3 course meal served for over 300 people, food was first class. Disco followed and drinks flowed but drink prices were sky high!

Enjoyable evening had by all.",4,2018,12,07
120,Normally ok but poor currently over Xmas party season,"The rooms are generally nice but some are poor for the money. Tonight I am in a room booked in advance for £300 plus with a window facing a wall! As a Hilton Diamond member I called down to reception, was told they are full but would check with the duty supervisor if anything could be done - I did not even get a call back! Very poor service from James Clarke’s team. The hotel bar has been booked out for private functions on both days that I have stayed this week. It is a nice bar when available to guests.",3,2018,12,05
120,Top Class Hotel - great Location,"Stayed for three nights last week. From the moment we arrived, each member of staff was most attentive and helpful. They couldn't do enough for their guests.
The room was most comfortable with plenty of space and tea-making facilities with a safe and minibar provided. The restaurant and bar were also excellent. For a five-star hotel I was surprised that the drinks were so reasonably priced.
The leisure centre was lovely. I used it each morning and evening
The hotel is situated near Blackfriars Bridge. There are three Tube stations within walking distance.
We shall certainly stay at the Hilton Bankside again.",5,2018,12,04
120,Great location,"Great location and such comfortable and huge beds. Good shower as well ruth nice toiletries. The breakfast was decent but not outstanding hence 4 stars. They had run out of brown bread and butter and were extremely slow to replace, plus we had to ask for coffee after being told someone would be straight over. Food was pleasant though. ",4,2018,12,03
120,Fantastic hotel but not a real Hilton,"Beautiful hotel new and fancy.
Location is amazing just behind the TATE
Walking distance to most London attractions !!
I don’t recall staying in such a good location for a reasonable price for a 5 stars hotel.
But, to be honest, it’s not what you expect from a Hilton - with a small Lobby and a nice room but window is facing a wall ...
Also breakfast is priced too expensive 
Service from the staff was great ",4,2018,12,03
120,Fabulous hotel in a Quiet Position,"Great Suffolk Street is in the quiet area of Bankside and the hotel sits well in a residential area. All sparkling new with plenty of helpful staff. Wonderful floral displays in the foyer helped to make us feel welcome. After a drink in the bar we went upstairs to change for a function later on in Piccadilly. While resting a waiter brought a small but beautifully decorated birthday cake for Mrs Mac and a card from the staff - a small but much appreciated gesture. The room was comfortable and the bed supremely so, most important after travelling. This is a great hotel in a wonderful area and well worth a visit. It is well positioned for visits both north and south of the river.",5,2018,12,02
120,"Welcoming, Comfortable and Excellent Service","It was my first time at this Hilton property.  I was very pleased with the warm reception, excellent room and nice service from their staff throughout their hotel.  The Executive Lounge is top notch and I received wonderful service from Mr. Muller.",5,2018,12,01
120,Wow ,"This Hilton is one of the nicest we’ve stayed at and we travel a lot and we only stay at Hilton and Marriott. We are just a couple stays away from diamond status actually. The property is gorgeous, the rooms are spacious, the staff is wonderful and the restaurant and bar are great too. Breakfast was included. They have a great buffet. Also the bellman Andrei couldn’t do enough for us !!! We will definitely be back here next year without a doubt !!! ",5,2018,12,01
120,Nice stay ,I stayed here for a few nights on a trip for work.  The check in process was quite easy as there was no line and the people were very nice.   The hotel is fairly modern and was in a decent location for walking.  The pillows were very soft which I like.  It was very clean. ,4,2018,11,30
120,"2nd stay this year, still my favorite London hotel","I wrote a review after my first stay earlier this year but wanted to write another so I could post pics of the standard room. Last time I stayed in an Executive room so can now compare to a standard king. Executive is much larger, but the quality is the same. I am a Hilton Diamond member so get lounge access and think this is the best Hilton lounge I have seen. I love the hotel location as I am a huge fan of the South Bank area.",5,2018,11,27
120,Fantastic hotel and experience,"Literally a flawless experience especially for the money. Rooms are fantastic, aircon, lovely bathroom, nice bedroom with every facility. The breakfast is excellent i recommend in bedroom, the
Bar is nice  with decent cocktails and room service is nice although quite expensive. We stayed for our anniversary and were treated extra specially! All in all great cant fault it for the money.",5,2018,11,24
120,"Great hotel, amazing staff ","We had a work event here. It’s brand new and only opens officially on December 1, and yet they were slick and well managed. Nice layout and decor. Great for business and leisure meetings. Definitely recommend it. ",5,2018,11,23
120,This is a great hotel by the Shard and Tate Modern.,"Conveniently located great hotel.  The hotel is by Tate Modern, and is a perfect location if you desire to be by the Shard.  The staff is excellent, and the rooms are nicely decorated.  The executive lounge was very nice.",5,2018,11,23
120,Superb Hotel,"I had booked two King Size Deluxe rooms. We had a very warm welcome as soon as we arrived through the doors by Jefferson who promptly took our luggage and then guided us to Radmila on Reception. Radmila was very professional and informed us we would have a text when the rooms were ready. So we went for a drink in the bar. As we were having a drink Radmila came over to us and one room was ready excellent. Then, I was unpacking the other room became available this information was given by text . Also Jefferson informed me he had already placed the cases in the room great communication. I had 2 rooms as my bestest (bad grammer) friend was visiting his partner in London. We didn't use the pool or gym no time. The hotel, is in my impression well run and the staff fully motivated and keen to help no matter what the questions or tasks are.Breakfast you have a wide range to chose and eggs are cooked to order and the restaurant is well spaced so you are not disturbed with chatter if your not a morning Person  I think the location is good once you get your bearings. Blackfriars station (Thameslink) and Southwark Tube is only Five mintues walk away.

The only problem I had in my room(327) there was an awful buzz. I didnt get in till  1am) so i didnt notice till  then when everything was quite and it wasn't the air con. I wouldn't have wanted  to change rooms that time of the morning. I reported it the  next morning and it was logged down very quickly by reception to be attended to. Also the fire alarm went off by mistake but a letter of apology was placed very quickly . 

I will certainly stay here and recommend this hotel for good location,excellent customer service (Radmila- Jefferson) Hope to see you all soon. have a good Christmas and happy New Year!",5,2018,11,22
120,Great stay & helpful staff,"So glad we upgraded the room because it was very spacious & nice. Loved having the Executive Lounge!!  The breakfast food was the same everyday, but the evening did vary. Nice to have drinks and a lounge area available to relax & unwind in. All the staff was friendly & very helpful. The concierge scheduled some touring events for us and also our ride to the airport...was nice to not have to worry about these details.  ",5,2018,11,21
120,Thank you Jefferson and Gregory,"We had a wonderful stay at the Hilton Bankside.

The breakfast and lounge are the best ive experience in London.

The service goes above and beyond, for example while waiting for my taxi, Jefferson was kind enough to get me  a coffee while I waited.

Gregory in the lounge was also very friendly and helpful.",5,2018,11,19
120,Wonderful experience ,"I will admit, before flying to London I was a little concerned about the location, as I thought it wouldn’t be lively enough.
The short walk to Borough market alone made it worth while, but the hotel itself exceeded any of my expectations. 
Service was great, as Hilton diamond members  we received a suite upgrade, which made our stay with view of the Shard even more enjoyable. 
The restaurant is the epitome of perfectly balanced design between comfortable, rustic elements and industrial accents. The breakfast selection was wonderful, as anything one’s heart desired was to be found (except for baked beans, which one would expect to go along proper British breakfasts, as well as not being explicitly informed about the option to have additional foods prepared). 
The executive lounge was not only beautiful, but offered wonderful snacks (only criticism: unfortunately just a small amount of clotted cream that always seemed to be out, when we were at the lounge). The lounge staff didn’t engage very much and was not to be seen a lot, which may be part of the concept. We just saw other guests’ tables with tea pots, but we were never asked or offered. 
The room (754) had a modern feel, enough space, nice walk in shower and two flatscreen TVs, with connected speakers in the bathroom ( nice feature!). 
The scent in the lobby was so wonderful that I wish I would have asked, in order to revisit our stay over and over again. Unfortunately I haven’t been able to find any information on it online. 
The only other “critique” I have is the room service. Being used to great room services at Hilton restaurants, the room service was very bland, bread was rubbery, no butter was provided and the chicken had no flavor. I would not necessarily get it again. 
All in all, I would absolutely recommend this Hilton ( member or not), as it is surrounded by cafes, grocery stores, across from Tate Modern, a 5-10 min walk from Borough market and around the corner from numerous bus stops. ",5,2018,11,18
120,Delightful Hotel,"Stayed here for business. Location very business friendly orientated. Have to say they are probably my favorite in London. Service is good, rooms are modern spacious and concierge on the ball. Nice coffee shop around the corner as well, forgot the name, but very cute.",5,2018,11,17
120,My favourite hotel in London,"I've stayed here countless times this year and it's my first choice when I'm staying in London.

The staff are always very helpful and really value your custom. The rooms are exceptional and the breakfast is great.",5,2018,11,17
120,London Trip,"Great Location near to Buroughs Market, Shard and Tube.Good rooms with great service. Walk able distance to most London city attractions. Enjoyed my 3 day visit. Will stay again when i am back in London",5,2018,11,16
120,Thanks you Elvira,"I would love to thanks to Elvira Loeri for our dinner was anwsome she’s shiny, smiling and very friendly. All the food was very nice and tasty and her service was really nice and perfect!!!! 
Thank you very much :) !!",5,2018,11,15
120,Excellent hotel,"Business trip so didn’t spend much time in the hotel but rooms new and a great location for the event I was at. Early check in, decent sized room, friendly staff. No stocked mini bar only downside but this is a new trend ",5,2018,11,14
120,Multiple stays,"This is now my go to hotel for all work stays in London. It is perfectly located along the Thames, and easily accessible to the tube or water taxi to get around town. I used the water taxi to get to the Excel for a tradeshow and it was about 40 minute journey. The staff is great and so are the amenities. Will be back!",5,2018,11,14
120,Best Hilton ever!,"I always stay in Hilton properties and is probably the nicest experience I can remember. The property is conveniently located to walk to attractions - 3 minute walk to the Tate modern, 5 minutes to the Globe and the river. Lots of cafes and shopping. Room was beautiful executive lounge is fantastic! Can’t go wrong  here",5,2018,11,11
120,Dinner ,I must say I have stayed  here a couple of times and never been disappointed. The food is fabulous and nothing is too much trouble for the staff. The rooms are top end very comfortable indeed. Would not hesitate to book here again a very enjoyable stay in London.,5,2018,11,10
120,One of the nicest Hilton’s worldwide,"Stayed here with my wife on a short holiday. I stay in approx 40 Hilton’s a year, this year 65 nights at Hilton properties YTD. This hotel is one of the nicest I’ve been to in the Hilton family. From the location near South Bank, to the chic lobby, restaurant, and bar to the quality and cleanliness of the property, to the service, to the complimentary mini bar, to the room appointments.... A+ experience. This is the nicest Hilton - bar none - in London, and I’ve stayed at 15 of them in the greater metro area. 

Spectacular job, Hilton, on what I consider one of your diamond properties. For those of you considering a hotel in London, no doubt you will be surprised and pleased with this Hilton. ",5,2018,11,10
120,Centrally Located,"Quality hotel centrally located within London with easy walk to Thames Bridges, City of London, Westminster, Jubillee Line, Waterloo and London Bridge Stations.  Good restaurant and plenty of pubs, restaurants and groceries within steps.",5,2018,11,10
120,Build it awards - Jumana was amazing!,I came for a lovely dinner for the build it awards. Jumana stood out by being very professional and going out of her way to provide a customer service. She took excellent care of us throughout the even. Excelent!,5,2018,11,09
120,Never disappointed ,"Another fantastic stay at the Hilton bankside. What an amazing location , so near the river, the Tate, wonderful Borough market and restaurants a plenty, you never have to use the underground. The welcome is always lovely, the flowers in the foyer always in season and the Honors front desk are always happy to see me. I have stayed here at least 6 times now and to be honest it wipes the floor with the Hilton tower bridge. If you are lucky enough to have executive lounge access then make sure to use it. The staff are fantastic and the food especially the breakfasts are first class. ",5,2018,11,08
120,One night for a conference,"First time in the Bankside area and stayed in this hotel for one night to attend a conference. It’s a great area with lots of restaurants and shops on the doorstep. You are 5 mins walk from the TateModern and the river. 

My room was on the first floor. The room was spacious but very dark with a tiny dingy window with no view. Lovely comfortable king size bed and large shower in bathroom. I didn’t eat in the restaurant but ate at the conference. Food very good. 

Efficient staff at reception. Modern spacious reception area. The whole hotel feels very new, modern and clean. I didn’t use the gym and pool so can’t comment on this.",5,2018,11,08
120,Visiting london,"Great room, service and excellent breakfast. The hotel is in a great location and easily commutable around London.
The spa facilities were very nice and the hotel catered well for the younger members of the family.",5,2018,11,06
120,Great location!,"We only stayed at the Hilton Bankside for two nights, but we enjoyed our stay there. It’s in a central location and the employees are all great! The concierge is very helpful and they will be able to setup any site-seeing tours for you. We will stay there again next time we’re in London.",5,2018,11,06
120,"Great Hilton, great service","We stayed on a Friday night as we were having dinner at The Oxo Tower which was within walking distance. 

Check in was smooth and we were offered a glass of bubbles at reception, which was a lovely way to start off the evening. We had a standard room which was comfortable, no view but that didn't matter to us, great shower which was far more important for a one night visit. 

The hotel bar is open to the pubic and has a real buzz about it, we joined along with the after work brigade so it was lively, especially as it was a Friday evening. Table service which I loved and complimentary popcorn. Once it got to about 7pm the bar had quietened down and it was a nice relaxed place to be. 

We didn't have breakfast at the hotel as there is so much choice around. We checked out and left our bag at the hotel and walked to The Ned for breakfast and this didn't disappoint. We followed this up with a audio tour of St Pauls which was excellent, back to the pub next to the hotel which was fun, collected our bags and headed home. 

A very successful trip and I wouldn't hesitate to stay here again if I was in this part of London.",5,2018,11,06
120,Best Hilton in the UK,"I have stayed here a couple of times, and this is by far and away the best Hilton in the UK. 

Staff are all fantastic, from check-in, to the lounge and to housekeeping. David - the manager of guest relations - and Alex at The Distillery are both some amongst the best employees I have seen across all my travels around the world, and not just at Hilton properties, with both ensuring all guests have the best experience possible. In truth, all the staff are incredibly friendly and professional, and my only regret is not having the opportunity to know more of them.

Rooms are modern and suit the surrounding area, and much more spacious than the Waldorf or Park Lane hotels.  The lounge is also one of the best-designed that I have seen, with great furnishings and food offerings throughout the day, including afternoon tea. The evening spread if perfect pre-dinner, with a nice selection of charcuterie, several hot options and a sufficient selection of alcohol.

Breakfast is also fantastic, and as a diamond can be had in lounge or the restaurant. My experience here as a diamond has always been fantastic, and service seems genuine - something you don't get at every hotel.

I really do love this property and all the staff, and look forward to my upcoming stays here.",5,2018,11,05
120,Don’t Miss Bankside,"This is a great part of London and this hotel works well for visitors. The walk from the Waterloo station seemed far after a long flight while dragging bags, but it is really only a 10-15 minute walk. This area is close to the Tate Modern, Globe Theatre, and the phenomenal Borough Market. A Hilton with all the usual amenities plus a refrigerator with complimentary drinks and snacks.",5,2018,11,04
120,"Great hotel, great location","We stayed as a family. Its a modern hotel with really good facilities. The location is what makes it a hit.
Well done up good choices of restaurants and food. The rooms were spacious and very comfortable. Service was great. Overall, a very comfortable stay.",4,2018,11,04
120,Very good hotel in good location ,"First time to this Hilton and was impressed with all the facilities at this newish hotel. We were upgraded to an Executive suite which is a great room with super bathroom, very comfortable bed and spacious separate lounge. The restaurant was very good for both dinner and breakfast. We used the indoor swimming pool which was in beautiful condition. There is an Executive lounge which serves afternoon tea and canapés from 5pm.
Throughout our stay the staff were very friendly and helpful. We felt very welcome.",5,2018,11,03
120,Wonderful hotel,"I have stayed here a few times when working away from home for a few days. I have to say this is my favourite hotel. The staff are very friendly and go out of their way to help, and the rooms are beautiful. There is a nice bar and nice restaurant, serving a great menu, and the buffet breakfast is fabulous with the chef preparing eggs to order. Unfortunately the hotel is slightly out of my price range, but if you can afford it and want to be in comfort with wonderful service this is the place! Will definitely stay again if I get the chance. ",5,2018,11,02
120,Bankside Hitlon a big hit,"My son and I recently stayed at the Bankside Hilton for a 4 day father-son outing and the experience was exceptional.  The staff are first class as well as the facility itself.  The location is perfect for important nearby London sites as well as being convenient to public transport.  It is a bit pricey but you get your money's worth in my opinion.  I was very impressed with the staff, their attitudes towards guests, professionalism, and general helpfulness",5,2018,11,02
120,A catalogue of cock ups - a second rate rip-off.,"For a flagship branch of this respected international franchise there was a lot to be disappointed with.

Valet parking was offered on the website with no qualification, none was available. 

The breakfast buffet in the premium ""Executive Lounge"" ran out of hot food, (well there was one half cooked piece of bacon left in a chafing dish marked Cumberland Sausages but that was it). The waiting staff tried to be helpful but did not speak English at all, not even the basics, and there was a five minute delay while  someone capable of communicating was found. 

The bar was excellent in terms of offerings and service/ However, despite the hotel's much puffed environmental responsibility the straws and stirrers in the bar were one use plastic which will pollute the oceans for 500 years, yet biodegradable alternatives are freely available.

Housekeeping standards were so low that there was  never any coffee in the room and the tea was not replaced over two mornings.

Worst of all though was the food in the Oxbo restaurant. The liver was served completely raw (not pink) inside and the replacement hamburger was inedible and stone cold.

The hotel's response was to promise to change the website about the parking (needless to say they haven't), and waive only the food bill from the restaurant - hardly over-generous in the context of the catalogue of errors, omissions and irritations experienced.

Really poor management and an inadequate response to my complaints; not pleasant or good value, in fact a second rate rip off.",2,2018,10,31
120,Good value in a good location for a modern London hotel,"Delivered very much what it promised.  Modern and comfortable room at a fair price for London.  Very close to the Tate and the Millenium Bridge which got to enjoy in the autumn sunshine many times.  And some enjoyable gastro pubs, bars and restaurants in the area.  Our room only had an internal view across a void to other rooms, but this was as expected and not a big issue given limited time in the room. Only issue was on a weekend night sounded like a nearby music venue a little loud - but ear plugs or tiredness dealt with that in relatively short order.  Would happily stay in this location and hotel again.",4,2018,10,31
120,lovely hotel but soundproofing not great,"Generally speaking, this is a nice hotel - modern comfortable rooms, with a great executive lounge that has long operating hours, lots of plugs bedside, and a pool you can actually swim some laps in.
However, a couple of items kept it from being perfect.  First of all, my room was quite dark - only 1 narrow window, when there could have been a wide bank of windows on that wall, taking advantage of the great view and natural light.  Secondly, the rooms are not well soundproofed - every single night and morning, I was awakened by slamming doors in the hallway, and people chattering in the hall.  Since this appears to be a newly built/remodeled hotel, it is a shame that soundproofing was not better addressed.  At some hotels I can crank up the fan on the HVAC to drown out extraneous noise, but the fan was super quiet, even on its highest setting.",4,2018,10,31
120,Best bartender ,"Chima is the best bartender 
Incredible bar service 
He was very helpful in tonight event as well as making my team very happy my boss came back to him throughout the night for he’s service. I will be sure to recommend him and he’s team for any future events. 
Team C&E

120,"What a find!! Fantastic location, amazingly comfortable and ultra chic!","What a find!! Fantastic location, amazingly comfortable and ultra chic!
Only 25 minutes Gatwick to London-Blackfriars for about £22 return and then 5minute walk to hotel. Hotel just a 2minute walk to Tate Gallery & lots of places along the Thames and just a 5 minute walk to tube for all the usual links (and very near Canary Wharf for a business trip!). 
Great bedrooms, fabulously comfortable beds and then wake up to the amazing power shower and a delicious breakfast.  The exec lounge is best I’ve been in.
Basically from first stepping into lobby area (which smells divine) received a great welcome and excellent service - everyone was very pleasant.
Will definitely be back to stay again - business & pleasure...",5,2018,10,30
120,First Rate London Hotel,"I Stayed here for a business event. The hotel is clean with contemporary decor, in addition a totally imacualte room. I have to say probably the nicest hotel I have stayed in London. 

If your staying in the location is also great,  just a short walk from Waterloo mainline station. You wouldnt ne dissapointed booking this hotel either for leisure or staying over for work purposes.",5,2018,10,30
120,Cultural break,We stayed in Bankside for the first time. We have stayed in many Hilton's and found this to be one of the best we have been in. The room are spacious and comfortable. Dinner in the restaurant was beautiful and breakfast was perfect. The staff throughout were extremely attentive to Al the guests. The restaurant manager was lovely. A perfect stay and will be going back next time we are in London.,5,2018,10,29
120,Lovely hotel in a great location,"I recently had the pleasure of staying in this hotel for a weekend with my sister and a couple of friends. The location is central but without the usual noise and traffic. A short walk to the tube at Southwark meant we were just minutes from Oxford St or Covent Garden. 

The hotel is beautifully laid out and the decor is modern and inviting. The executive lounge provided a delicious breakfast with an impressive array of food to choose from. It's a lovely haven to come back to after a day in the city. 

My bedroom was bright and spacious, air conditioned and quiet. I can honestly say it was the most comfortable bed I've ever slept in! The bathroom was well stocked and the shower was modern and powerful.  

The staff were friendly and helpful with directions and suggestions of local places to visit. Ask at reception for their Foodie Map. Borough Market and the Tate Modern are a short walk away, along with numerous local bars and restaurants.",5,2018,10,29
120,Brilliant!,"My husband and I stayed here as part of our Golden Wedding year.
Our son and daughter in law organised everything.  An unbelievably fabulous present which included a Cliff concert at the Albert Hall.  From the moment we arrived we were made to feel welcome and were presented with a welcome glass of Prosecco when checking in.  Our room was perfect, huge very comfortable bed, plenty wardrobe space and the bathroom was lovely.
Everything spotless.  Within 10 mins arriving in our room we were presented with a beautiful chocolate cake decorated to celebrate our special anniversary.  The executive lounge was well decorated and the choice of food was excellent.  The breakfast was delicious and plentiful.
We must emphasise that everyone we met, from the lovely doorman complete with top hat to the receptionists, to the girls in the executive lounge, to the chambermaids (not sure if they are still called that!)were smartly dressed, very attentive and very professional and friendly.
Thank you Hilton Bankside for making our stay such a memorable experience.",5,2018,10,29
120,An excellent concierge!,I would like to highlight the concierge John Kortenray's readiness to help with the problem I had with the plug adapter of my computer. It wasn't an easy mission for him to find what I needed but he did it! He didn't rest until he solved my problem. Excellent customer service!,5,2018,10,29
120,Tip-top,"What a hotel! Awesome stay with very conscientious staff, especially Dylan Hieu who served at our table at breakfast time.

The room was very clean and comfortable. 

We went for a swim, and while the pool was simple it was very clean and with plenty of room. ",5,2018,10,27
120,Great Stay!,"Beautiful hotel, great location, amazing breakfast (the staff in the Breakfast restaurant were awesome) and all of the hotel staff were friendly and so helpful! I would definitely stay here again when visiting London!",5,2018,10,25
120,Fabulous hotel - something special,"Having stayed at many Hilton hotels this has to be my all time favourite, it is something else, and a bit more special in terms of location, decor and service. 
Staying from Friday to a Sunday with friends over from Ireland from first entering the hotel we were pleasantly surprised. The decor is outstanding, industrial modern and a touch retro chic. The staff were so friendly and helpful and went that extra mile to ensure our stay was special. The concierges x 2 were ultra helpful and informative.
Gorgeous hotel in a wonderful location, tate modern just across the road, bankside walk along the river and close to Borough Market bustling with all types of food and drink. So close to Southwark tube so travelling into London was a breeze. 
The foyer of the hotel is beautifully styled and smells divine. The executive lounge is stunning and such a treat to have access included in our room rate. We spent our morning lounging here over a leisurely free breakfast, fabulous hot and cold choices and endless options for drinks. Afternoon tea is served here free in the afternoon and evenings canapés snacks and selected alcoholic drinks are available. This is a gem and so worthwhile having this as an option during your stay.
Our room was stunning, decor sublime mix of modern and warehouse styling, stunning bathroom with wet room style shower with both standard shower head and rainforest style. Complimentary water and soft drinks in the fridge, fluffy white towels, complimentary toiletaries, fluffy bathrobes and slippers all made our stay a bit more luxurious. As for the bed which was mega comfortable and provided a fantastic 2 nights sleep. Rooms are quiet air conditioned and radio can be set to play in the bathroom.
We ate in the restaurant and the food and drinks were lovely, the bar has an endless list of cocktails a lot gin related and drinks to choose from which we enjoyed, they have 56 gins so I'm told.
A big shout out and thank you to Gianluca in the exec lounge who added to our stay and provided some suggestions for shows and places to visit.
All in all this was the best hotel stay I've ever had and an experience I can't wait to repeat. 

Thank you so much for a wonderful stay.",5,2018,10,25
120,Perfect!,"My wife and I stayed at the hotel for four nights. From the moment we arrived and until we left everything was just perfect. The room was always clean and tidy, the staff always pleasant and the service was of the highest standard. The business lounge is really worth it and we loved the room very much, there even was music in the shower connected to smart TV. The hotel's location is excellent, walking distance to the nearest metro station.",5,2018,10,24
120,Yet again another fantastic stay,"I said in my last review that this is now my favourite hotel in London and after last weekend's visit I still stand by that.
The hotel is not perfect, the fridge on the room is not effective, looking across to other rooms and keeping curtains/screens closed does make the room feel gloomy. However, the friendly staff and great Executive Lounge more than makes up for those niggles. I am always welcomed as a loyal Hilton Honors member and reception staff could not do enough. I'm back in London in January and of course will be booking Bankside again.",5,2018,10,24
120,Pleasant trip!," am not a frequent customer here on TripAdvisor, never believed too much in the true and genuine power of this tool. But, I recently visited Hilton Bankside in London and had the most pleasant encounter: I nearly always travel alone either for business or leisure and this girl at reception  was so understanding and going beyond my needs. Her name is Rachel and was there every time I had one question and ready to go the extra mile for this lone traveller providing her with suggestions, transportation plans and so on and so forth. Thank you, Rachel! I felt very welcome in London :) ",5,2018,10,23
120,Thoroughly positive experience,"Great location near Tate Modern, Old Vic and New Vic theatres, Borough Market , Globe theatre and the river. 
     Good size room, good bed and bathroom. Oxbo restaurant and the Distillery bar were good experiences. Professional and attentive staff. Surpassed our expectations.",5,2018,10,23
120,Not as good as it looks,"Based on the online reviews, I was really looking forward to checking in at the Hilton London Bankside. However, even though this is quite a nice hotel on the surface, there were a number of issues that in sum made the stay a disappointment.

First of all, recognition of Honors Gold status is particularly poor at this property. There was no ""thank you for your loyalty"" at check-in. A minor thing, yes, but something you really notice as a guest when this is the norm everywhere esle. When I asked about access to the executive lounge in lieu of an actual room upgrade, something I have been offered at many other hotels from the Hilton group all over the world, it was made clear that Golds typically do not receive any upgrades here at all. I know that I am not entitled to an upgrade, but a hotel policy that makes lack of upgrades for Golds the rule rather than the exception is very disappointing and borders on offensive in my opinion. Finally, when we got to our room expecting the ""little something"" upscale hotels usually provide for status members - some fruit, a bit of chocolate, a card maybe - there was... nothing. Again, this may seem like something not worth fretting over, but it is just so NOTICEABLE when omitted - and so easy and cheap to do for the hotel, actually.

Sleep quality was not good. The first night, sleeping was difficult because of a very  soft mattress topper which made the bed uncomfortably warm. When it was removed for our second night, it became clear why it was there in the first place: The beds are extremely hard. So basically, you get the choice between sweating and back pain...

Talking of the beds, one of our pillows was not fresh at all. In other words, it smelled of sweat really badly. I asked for it to be replaced, however, it was only removed from the room, and a replacement was not provided. We were left with three pillows for the second night - enough for two people, sure, but why was this simple and justified request not completed?

The only unique selling point of the ""Deluxe"" rooms seems to be the ""complimentary soft-drinks"". In all other respects they appear to be identical to the regular guest rooms. The soft-drinks, however, were a complete joke - two bottles of lemonade in a fridge that only managed to keep them slightly below room temperature. For a room perk like this I expect a full range of brand name products, including energy drinks and juice. But like this, there is absolutely no point in booking a Deluxe Room - not for a potential upgrade (see above) and certainly not for two bottles of lemonade.

I did like how the room was furnished, but because of poor lighting and a very small window, it did not feel friendly and spacious at all, but actually a bit gloomy and claustrophobic. Quite a wasted opportunity.

The Hilton London Bankside is rated at five stars, which in my opinion is not justified. And even at a four-star property, the issues we encountered would not be forgivable, in particular the complete lack of loyalty status recognition. Out of the four hotels from the Hilton group I have tried in London, this is my least favourite.",2,2018,10,22
120,I cannot say enough good things about this hotel,"This is a fantastic hotel in Southwark.  We checked in and Angelo made us feel completely at home.  From time to time, we would receive texts from him inquiring on our stay, which was like having your own personal assistant, which we loved.  Not long after we arrived, the hotel chef sent a piece of delicious honey cake to our room.  That was a nice surprise.  All of the housekeeping staff, the folks who worked at Front Desk, and the restaurant/lounge were outstanding.  The hotel is gorgeous and has this fox motif, throughout.   The rooms have modern conveniences like charging stations in the wall next to the bed that fit USB.  The bathroom is well appointed and nice.  The breakfast we had in the restaurant each day was very good.  Debra greeted us by name, most mornings. The chefs were so kind in making an omelette for me each day.  We became quite fond of this cherry danish they had, too.  We had attended the afternoon tea a few times and enjoyed the sandwiches, cakes and delicious scones with strawberry jam.  The Executive Lounge is one of the best, not just for the large space but for the employees.  If you are looking for a hotel, look no further.  This place is outstanding.  The Southwark tube station is about a 5 min walk away, or you can go the opposite way 2 mins to the Tate Modern, or 3 mins more past the Tate to the Thames.  You can walk the Millennium Bridge in no time from the hotel.  There are 2 grocery stores 1 min down the same street.  Next time we return to London, we will be here.",5,2018,10,21
120,Fantastic service and good hotel,"Stayed here for 3 nights with my wife. 
We were so lucky to get a free upgrade to a deluxe room on the 7th floor. 
We were also offered free late check out, really good service from all the staff at the hotel.
The hotel is new, clean and with big rooms. Nice breakfast. We liked the location.",5,2018,10,21
120,Perfect stay in London,"We spend five nights in the hotel. The room was at 2p.m. not ready. So we have to wait.
When you get Lounge acces you can’t go into the restaurant for breakfast.
Very good rooms.
Very clean.
Spa is very small.
Silent rooms.
Nearby the tube and millennium bridge.",5,2018,10,19
120,Top notch Hilton,"Very smart and modern Hilton. Exec Lounge and Breakfast as good as it gets. 
Rooms are smart, clean, and contemporary. 
Location great for Southbank or Borough market. 
Only downside is that hotel is not that close to a tube station.",5,2018,10,19
120,Looking Forward to Staying There Again,"The hotel is of my favorite ones in London due to its location, delicious breakfasts, high quality services as well as facilities. This hotel has an especial environment and nice personnel would always keep your stay comfortable.",5,2018,10,18
120,One of the Best Hotel Experiences,"We stayed here for five days a week ago.  I am a Diamond Member so I had access to the Executive Lounge during my stay.  Everything was perfect from our room, to the dining options, to the Concierge, to the Executive Lounge.  The customer service at this hotel is top notch, and is now my favorite Hilton hotel.  Five stars",5,2018,10,17
120,"Posh, Unique, and Excellent Location","My husband and I stayed here for just a night while awaiting our cruise to depart. We arrived at 8am having just completed a transatlantic flight, and while we certainly didn't expect our room to be ready before check-in time, we were impressed by the genuine remorse the front desk seemed to express for our predicament (jet lag lol). We had a fabulous on-site breakfast, and by the time we finished and prepared to spend a bit of time at the pool, they had already found us a room! We were so pleasantly surprised. The lobby is decorated so it's modern and warm. We especially loved our room. The location couldn't have been better. Absolute 5 stars from me.",5,2018,10,15
120,City Break,"The hotel was nice and all the usual facilities you would expect from a Hilton, we had an executive room as so had access to the lounge which provided all the usual's. The hotel was very relaxing and it was a peaceful trip, the bar is also a nice setting, and the location is great for exploring the south bank and Tate. ",4,2018,10,15
120,American Football in London,"Loved the stay at Hilton (Bankside), Staff great, Room very clean and silent, window couldn’t be opened, no deal because air condition could be turned off as well, only one small downside: breakfast room was too crowded, maybe it was rush hour 😉",5,2018,10,14
120,Excellent End for a perfect Vacation ,"Found ourselves winding down an unforgettable journey in Europe and choosing this gem for our last night. Arrived in London on an early flight. Check in was a breeze, and some of the best Bloody Mary’s I’ve encountered along with great hospitality behind the bar made the short wait for our room to be prepared seem like no time. Circled back to the bar for a night cap following a iconic performance at Shakespeare’s Globe. Awesome hotel! ",5,2018,10,14
120,Hello Hilton,"From the magnificent fragrance that greets you as you enter the foyer to the very friendly but professional staff, the Hilton Bankside is well worth a visit. The rooms are well appointed with great amenities and serviced well. 
The breakfasts are a treat and the staff on duty are full of energy and cannot do enough to assist or make your experience memorable. When we are next in London we will definitely stay at the Hilton Bankside.",5,2018,10,14
120,Amazing team and exactly what you expect from a 5 star luxury property,"The team here made my stay a memorable one, so friendly, helpful and they genuinely cared about making my stay perfect. Great recommendations on places to visit and nothing was too much hassle. Very central and a great base to explore London, i highly recommend staying here.",5,2018,10,12
120,"Clean, Quiet and Easy","Excellent stay: The hotel is very clean with sleek, modern décor. Reception and house keeping staff were quick and attentive. Best of all the room was soundproof and had blackout curtains. There are several coffee bars, grocery stores and dinning places within a 2 minute walk.",5,2018,10,11
120,Mrs,"On Sunday 7 October we had a 70th birthday celebration at Hilton Bankside at the OXBO restaurant. The food, service and atmosphere were all amazing. Our thanks to Kamal and Juan Vasquez who gave us the very best service and made sure my husband had a very memorable birthday. We will certainly be returning in the near future and will recommend this restaurant to our friends and family.
",5,2018,10,11
120,"Cool Style, Great Food, Quiet Room","We’ve been to quite a few hotels in London before so we expected the usual ‘huge-city-hotel-ammenities’. But the Hilton Bankside is really a gem in the hotel jungle of London. It’s stylish and new, the rooms are big - even the bathroom! - and quiet, and the food at the Oxbo Restaurant is very good (so if you’re just too tired after a day of sightseeing, staying at the hotel for dinner is a good option). There’s even a Spa and a Pool, and services overall are very very nice. 
Loved it. ",5,2018,10,10
120,Lovely stay at this hip Hilton,"I stayed for the 1st time at the Hilton Bankside, and I have to say that I was delighted. The whole building was brand new, well designed and
adequately furnished.

The room was a bit of a surprise for me. On the pictures on the internet,
 it looked a bit dark. But in reality, it was beautiful. The colour schemes, the entrance floor varies from the main floor of the room itself. The room was spacious and very comfortable. 

The staff was welcoming and professional and very kind. 

Breakfast comes as a buffet, yet you could choose à la carte. Up to your choice.

The Bar is a place to hang with friends in the evening or even to work during the day.",5,2018,10,10
120,Exceptional,"I went here for a big event last Friday and I must say this was one of the most amazing dinners I have had. To cater for 300 people is no easy task but the food was incredible. From the salmon starter, to the main of lamb & then the lovely cheesecake pudding. It was so light, yet filling & fantastically presented. Will recommend for future events.",5,2018,10,09
120,WOW! One of the best hotels I have ever stayed in!,"Someone really thought about all of the details which makes travel a comfortable experience. The rooms decor is very calming and it was very quiet. Little things like curtains which extend over the other to effectively block out the the light, a low non glare night light in the bathroom, carpet which feels nice underfoot. The location is great and easy to get around.The staff were all so very helpful. The conciere even walked us out to the front of the hotel to point out directions and made it possible for us to get a private taxi to see the sights during a rain storm. And the restaurant, what a beautiful display of assorted items, great service and plenty of seating in a really nice atmosphere. I can't say enough about this hotel and I have stayed in a lot of them.",5,2018,10,07
120,Living like the Royals,"After an exceptional stay last year, our family returned to be welcomed back royally.  From our welcome text to our last goodby, everyone went out of their way to offer fantastic service and warm cheer.  People make a difference, and when you stay here you feel at home. Great property, great location in a unique part of London that allows you to stroll the Thames and enjoy easy access to the historic and cultural environs.  But stay for the hotel's comfort, the exceptional food, amenities, and service, and most importantly, the people who are genuinely glad that you are there.",5,2018,10,07
120,"Ideal Location, Great Service","This was my second time staying at Hilton London Bankside and it was a fantastic stay just as I did the first time. This property is ideally located to public transportation to get to all the fun stops around the city vey quickly. Front desk and concierge service was exceptional and staff was very friendly the whole time. The room was well kept and while this is minor, it may be time to get newer towels. The last time I stay here dinner was great at the restaurant but this time I was a little disappointed with my steak and corn soup. Nevertheless, breakfast was great and the bar service was exceptional so get dinner right and next time I will definitely give 5 stars.",4,2018,10,05
120,The best,I spent just 1 night here but it’s honestly one of the best hotels I’ve stayed. The rooms are spacious and luxury. The staff txt me to ask if my room was satisfactory! I didn’t get to use the pool but the breakfast was really nice buffet style I’d definitely go again,5,2018,10,05
120,"Quality, quiet, comfort.","This is the second time I have stayed here in the past two years.  I like staying here because it is off the beaten path a bit yet still close to London bridge, the market, and tower bridge.  The rooms are nice and comfortable.  Very friendly staff.  Only complaint this trip is, as a diamond member they put me in a small room on second floor with a view of a parking structure. Last time I was given a much better room.  Diamond status with Hilton not what it used to be.",4,2018,10,04
120,modern interior,"We spent three nites, got a perfect service by the staff. It's literally close to everything.
Cheap laundry shop is not from from the hotel. Quiet area and a lot of cheap grocery stores. Plenty of Pubs in the area and other chain hotels.",5,2018,10,03
120,Mr.,"The Oxbo Restaurant in the Hilton is a great restaurant. I’ve eaten here many times and the fish, chicken, bread, salads, and wine are very well prepared. Excellent food. But the best thing about eating at Oxbo is the staff from around the world. They are very friendly, helpful and provide excellent service. Erica, Lexandru, Giota, Andrea and Elvira get my highest rating. They are really great, each of them. David S.",5,2018,10,01
120,Dr.,"Magic week in a very nice hotel with marvelous location, few minutes walk from main monuments like Big Ben tower, London eye, Mellinium Bridge , Tower Bridge , the Shard...etc. Magnificent lobby, very clean hotel , extraordinary restaurant and friendly personnel. Just try it once you will love it.",5,2018,10,01
120,In house Engineer,"It is our second night stay of 6 nights in London and our cooler had broken down. We called the front desk to schedule a repair and we were served within 15 mins. We were greeted by a very nice and friendly hotel staff and you could quickly tell he was the hotel engineer by his appearance; a big tool-bag with many tools and a heavy duty uniform. He assessed the situation with us with a lot of courtesy before quickly getting to work - going the extra mile by telling us what he would do if he were in our shoes. So he suggested that he could take the whole fridge out and have it tested in his lab before bringing it back in an hour, which he completed in about just 30 mins. The whole disassembling and assembling process was painful to watch - it wasnt easy. But he did it with dedication and professionalism. All in all, what I want to do with this review is to give thanks to Dobrin Chakarov. Because of your help we are able to keep our milk fresh for the next few days and thats invaluable to us. I would also like to extend my thanks to Hilton for the pleasant stay so far. London is a beautiful city :)",5,2018,09,30
120,Delivered,"Once again Hilton deliverea an ultimate luxury hotel experience with extra care for their guests. Great room service, connections with the city and beautiful, delicate rooms. Love the design and the views",5,2018,09,30
120,Very nice hotel in Southwark,"Stayed at this hotel as we had a wedding nearby. Definitely the best Hilton I have stayed at.

The current and modern design sets it apart from other hotels. Large and spacious rooms, huge bed and lovely bathroom. 

Brilliant location. Sainsbury’s local and Tesco express next door, as well as a variety of restaurants/cafes across the road.

Didn’t eat at the hotel, but had their coffee from the in-house coffee shop which was really good. Didn’t interact much with staff as we didn’t need to, but from what we did they were very friendly.

Highly recommend this hotel.",5,2018,09,29
120,Excellent Property,"Traveling to London from Ireland.  We had stayed in a bunch of smaller B&B type places in Ireland as we were driving everywhere but I wanted someplace central and posh for London leg of our trip, wanted to spoil my wife and son.
As a Diamond Hilton guy, would have received exec lounge privilege no matter what room I booked but we stayed on the exec floor anyway just to have a bigger room.  I unfortunately didn't get an upgrade but the place was very busy and there was only one nicer room.
Hotel is pretty close to the Southwark station.  I originally thought someplace closer to the west end or Buckingham would have been nice, but as we walked around those areas, I was glad for the relative peace of Southwark.  Hotel was a minutes walk from the Tate Modern and the Globe, two of our Must See attractions.
Hotel staff were constantly on point.  From the door men to the front desk and especially the Exec Lounge ladies, just a great job.  The front desk even had a nice card and desserts waiting for my son in the room, very special touch.
The executive lounge really makes the stay.  Great breakfast, snacks, all types of water and good tea/snacks for afternoon tea.  Some nice bar drinks for the evening reception.  The breakfast was so good, we never hit the main restaurant for breakfast.
The room itself was very comfortable with great beds and a nice shower.  Not sure if they do it on every floor, but we had complimentary drinks and snacks refreshed in our room daily.
Hotel also has a decent size pool (by hotel standards, maybe 20 meters long) where I was able to relax in the evening.  If you walked all day, use the jaccuzzi to ease tired muscles.  Didn't get hot, but the jets worked some knots out of my calf muscles.

Highly recommend this hotel.",5,2018,09,29
120,The place you want to stay at,"I visited London quite a few a times lately for long-term business stays and tried out different hotels in central London on that occasion. The Hilton Bankside became my favourite one and my ""go-to"" hotel right after my first stay: 

The rooms are very modern as the hotel was built just a few years ago (which is a big plus for London). The large and very comfortable bed, the room design as well as a huge raindrop shower are the highlights here.
The leisure facilities (gym, pool) are very clean, well equipped and maintained. Bar, restaurant and the executive lounge offer very comfortable seating in a modern and chic design.

Though, the most important reason for me sticking to the Hilton Bankside and coming back over and over again was the amazing staff: 

The hotel staff did an outstanding job making myself feel as a very valued guest and being cared for, nipping potential problems in the bud and creating an environment in which I felt very comfortable. All of the staff I met during my stay (with no exception) were very kind, courteous and at the same time very professional.  
On any question or wish I had, I always received instant support that was carried out with a smile on the face. 

From my point of view providing such an environment is one of the most desirable qualities a hotel can achieve. For pleasure or business, in either case, that's the place you want to stay. 

Since these great people had a positive impact on my quality of life during my stays abroad, I would like to highlight the following professionals for their exceptional guest services:

Ali from the restaurant (He provides you with the best Omelette's in whole London, most definitely!)
Celina, Anna, Federica and Dylan from the restaurant
Gergely and Deborah from the Executive Lounge
Giacomo and Rumen from the Bar
The concierges John and Mark
as well as the doormen Alvaro and Andrei

Looking forward to coming back soon!",5,2018,09,27
120,New and smartly done,"Stayed here for a quick two night stay in 2017. Loved the location. Hotel itself was recently updated and they did a very nice job with the update. Room itself was modern and had many integrated outlets, but also very comfortable overall. Bedding was excellent and top notch. Smart use of lighting in the room too - bright enough in every way, but in no way making it as though an operating theater. Easy to walk here from across the Thames, and it was easy walks to the Tower Bridge and other sites.",5,2018,09,27
120,Weekend away,"We stayed here for  nights in September.  The hotel was very clean and all the staff very welcoming and helpful. The concierges were very knowledgeable and very helpful, they gave us excellent options where to eat in close proximity of the hotel. Thank you guys!!!

Our room was spacious and let’s not forget the most comfortable bed. The shower was amazing in the large wet room. 

The Hotel is a great base for exploring the Southbank, Borough market, London bridge and the Shard. The only a short walk  from Southwark underground, we walked back from Covent Garden which only took about 20mins. This hotel is literally a 20 minute walk from most anywhere you'd want to go.",5,2018,09,27
120,A base for exploring,"We stayed here for 3 nights in September. We had an excellent stay. The hotel was clean and the staff very welcoming. Our room was spacious, the bed was really comfortable and the shower was amazing. We found the room a great place to relax in after a days sight seeing. The Hotel is a great base for exploring the south bank and its only a short Uber ride away from Covent Garden, Trafalgar Square etc. 

We really enjoyed our stay and will come back next time we are in London.",5,2018,09,26
120,Best stay in London,"So often I have been disappointed with elements of my stay in London.
Not this time! Best stay I have had in London.
Excellant customer service, staff were all brilliant.
Stayed in room with executive lounge access. Apart from the Hilton at Wembley, this is the best lounge I have experienced.
Bedrooms were peaceful, luxurious and modern.
We can't wait for our next visit, thank you.",5,2018,09,26
120,"Great breakfast, rooms a bit small","Good stay only really let down by rooms on the small side and room cleaning. Glasses not cleaned, towels left on the floor. No turn down on  our third night. However, staff in general were very good. Breakfast was excellent and the restaurant staff were great. Just sort out the cleaning staff!",4,2018,09,25
120,A great place to stay!,"I love my stay at this wonderfully property! Being a hotelier myself, I was very impressed by the professionalism of the front desk lady Erlanda! I had a room move and was in a hurry and slightly bad humoured, but she handled my request with care and professionalism, thank you very much! I’ll be back!",5,2018,09,23
120,Impressive service during breakfast,"I was impressed by the hotel staff, Ms Alessia, for her excellent and genuine service for taking care of hotel guests during breakfast time. I stayed there for 4 days and found that her service was consistently excellent.",4,2018,09,22
120,Great Place to Stay,"We spent five nights at the Hilton Bankside and really enjoyed our stay.  It was the first time we have stayed on the Bankside and we really enjoyed the great neighborhood, wide variety of restaurants and easy access to the Jubilee Walkway and attractions.
The staff at the Hilton were super friendly and always ready with suggestions and guidance on travel options and restaurants.  They really made us feel welcome every day.  The rooms were modern, with lots of connections for USB and even an outlet for American plugs; large;  and very clean.  Their breakfast buffet was one of best we have ever seen.  By the second day, the cook remembered how we wanted our eggs/omelets.  All of the staff were helpful and ready with coffee drinks, juices, etc.  A special thank-you to Andrea for treating us so well each morning when we arrived for breakfast.",5,2018,09,22
120,Enjoyable stay as always,"We thoroughly enjoyed our stay at Hilton Bankside as always and appreciate the hospitality shown by all the staff. Special thanks to Mr Kamal, the Assistant Manager who always welcomed us for breakfast with the happiest smile and offering the best service. Looking forward to more stays here. ",5,2018,09,22
120,"Nice hotel, nice breakfast, nice everything","I had a wonderful time in this hotel, there is complimentary wifi, breakfast is big and good. The rooms are quiet and nice as well as the bathroom. Fitness is big enough and there is a swimming pool. Everything OK.",4,2018,09,19
120,One of the best Hilton stay~,"I've been to many Hilton brand properties for both business and leisure but this one has become my favorite Hilton property. It could be because it is still ""new"" or the fact that it is very closely located to Tate Modern or that you can walk to the charming Borough market or the bridge, but the experience was a 5 star that I haven't seen from Hilton brand lately. The property itself it not big (like most hotels in London) but very well appointed. The lobby and the adjacent restaurant/bar is tastefully decorated, the front desk staffs were superbly nice and helpful (and flexible to meet your needs). The deluxe room that I got was of decent size with modern/minimalism decor with wood accents throughout the floor and celling. The bathroom is well laid out with a walk-in shower that still looks brand new (or really well maintained). The room came with a complimentary drinks in the mini refrigerator (a nice touch) and comfy bed to guarantee a good night sleep. The breakfast venue is also modern/industrial looking (a trend that I see throughout London with Edison bulbs and big wooden communal tables) but the spread was just ""meh"" but the quality was ok. The restaurant/bar (also decorated in modern industrial/cigar bar-esque way) adjacent to the lobby serves specialty gins so that was an experience (I do recommend to try if staying in this hotel). The property itself is modern and well appointed and the quality of service by the staffs are one of the best I've seen from Hilton. Plus the location is great being on a walking distance to lots of nearby attraction but quiet at night to ensure quality sleep. I would definitely reconsider this hotel in the near future.",5,2018,09,18
120,Superb hotel. Very comfortable and very nice,"This hotel is marvelous and the staff is very helpful. The rooms are gorgeous. Restaurant is very good. It is a short walk from southwark tube. I do recommend the hotel big time. Bed are super comfortable. Rooms a very clean and recently renovated.

We got upgraded to a room with a view on the shard. ",5,2018,09,18
120,Comfortable and welcoming hotel,"Hilton Bankside has become my hotel of choice when visiting a London. It is a comfortable and well appointed hotel, staffed by people who do their upmost to help you. From the moment the concierge opens your taxi door, the staffers do their best to ensure that you are kept happy.

Our Executive room was generously proportioned with a large bathroom, which had a bath and separate walk-in shower. The bed was very comfortable and the evening turn down service was very welcome.

One of the best features of this location is the OXBO Restaurant. The breakfasts there are both generous and tasty, with a wide selection of foods for every taste. In the evening dinner there is of a very high standard. There is a large and varied menu, all of which is delicious and can be accompanied by fine wines. One could dine there regularly and not be disappointed. 

Unreservedly recommended.",5,2018,09,17
120,Breakfast Staff was awesome!,"Four Stars, mostly thanks to the breakfast staff. Everyone was wonderful, absolutely warm, friendly, excellent service and then some. Very helpful and attentive. Yes, everyone in the breakfast staff. One particular person who went the extra mile was Mallika. She made sure to order gluten- free options for me, every day, all 4 days! She even packed a bag of fruit for my onward travels. Kamal was also very helpful as was Royston, who remembered us from our visit last year and who was very attentive to my gf requirements last year.  The location of this property is outstanding.. centrally located, walking distance to many attractions. Most of the general staff were also very friendly, wish I had noted down a few names. All the concierges were very knowledgeable. Mark was exceptional..he even gave us tips about the exact landmarks and locations, about gates and locks and trains. Superior knowledgeable service. All in all, a pretty good stay...took off one star because of some hiccups at the reception desk and in the lounge.",4,2018,09,17
120,Excellent location and amazing room,"Located in the heart of London, with all the attractions around and plenty of restaurants to visit. The hotels restaurant was brilliant, as was the impressively large basement swimming pool. The room was large with a good sized wet room. Would recommend and will return.",5,2018,09,17
120,Perfection ,"Everything was great. From the first communication at check in to saying good bye. Staff is very professional and attentive but not intrusive. There’s a personal touch to it, from receiving a text asking how it is so far and if I want anything, to a cute personal note from housekeeping.
The room and bathroom were beautiful, fresh, spacious. Immaculately clean. 
The type that makes you want to stay inside  the whole time. 
There was a lot of free refreshments in the fridge, bathrobe and slippers.
 And let’s not forget the most comfortable bed you can ask for with perfectly ironed linen.
Location is great. Happening, safe, lively area with plenty of stores and restaurants around. Walking distance to many attractions and a lot of public transport options.",5,2018,09,17
120,Good one night stay,"Short overnight stay with breakfast.  Room on 3rd floor was fine, with bathrobes, slippers, umbrella, wifi, tea coffee etc.  Couldn't quite fathom at the room lighting though.  Good breakfast and valet parking.
Service from all staff was excellent in this busy hotel, very convenient for SE1 and attractions.",5,2018,09,17
120,Great service,Perfect Service we loved our stay .. exceptional from staff most especially Andrea Navajo keep it up. would recommend it 100%.. we w'll come back again soon... a yes Fizzy Friday what an amazing invention ;),5,2018,09,16
120,"Lovely hotel, good location.","We stayed at Hilton London Bankside for 9 nights, our second visit.  It is a very nice hotel with a fabulous buffet breakfast.  Close to Southwark tube station and to Southbank.  Concierge is very helpful.  We originally booked dinner bed and breakfast but dropped the dinner option as the menu was extremely limited and didn’t really cater for a vegetarian.  After eating from the a la carte menu (very nice) the first night we were told we could only have a set menu.  This didn’t suit so reception staff (Luisa) was very helpful and our rate was adjusted.  We were in Edinburgh for 2 nights after our first night at Bankside and the hotel kindly stored our luggage until we returned which was very helpful.  Will stay at this hotel again if in London.",5,2018,09,16
120,Superb location and hotel for South Bank Visit,"We were bringing our son to university and needed somewhere central. This was my third trip to London and we typically stay close to Victoria station. Not after this! Southbank is where it's all happening. Hilton is a quick block from the Tate Modern, so close to the Globe, the prison and Burroughs Market. To the west, is the Waterloo Bridge and close proximity to the Strand, Covent Garden and Trafalgar Square is another 10 minutes from there. The London Eye west of Waterloo is full of street performers, museums and various attractions. This hotel is literally a 15 minute walk from most anywhere you'd want to go, while giving you a quiet area to rest your head.

Service at the Hilton Bankside is exceptional. Breakfast buffet here covers every taste, the lounge in the evening was a great place for us to regroup after a night out. We also had access to the executive lounge which was so valuable to us that first day especially. Concierge was so helpful with all the things we were looking for and quick with a cab or anything else we needed. The room was very nice and we sure appreciated the bedside water bottles each night.",5,2018,09,16
120,Great hotel,Nicely decorated hotel. Comfortable rooms and good bed. Located close to underground station and a number of highlights of London. And who doesn’t want to have a swim in the indoor swimming pool after a long day walking through the city?,5,2018,09,15
120,My favourite Hilton hotel in London ,"Hilton Bankside is new and shiny with decor that is sleek and on trend, which is matched by the buzz and vibe of this hotel. 

All of the staff are friendly, keen to help and on hand for any queries. The hotel is well located for the Southbank and beyond and would be a great place to stay for a weekend in London, although on this occasion I was in town for work.

The rooms are spacious and well designed and for a large hotel it has a surprisingly boutique feel. Sadly I didn’t have chance to make use of the leisure facilities and an early morning meeting meant no chance for breakfast but I am sure the quality of these amenities matches the high standards elsewhere in the hotel. 

This place changed my view of Hilton’s after some hideous experience at the Metropole in NW London and I would highly recommend staying here. ",4,2018,09,13
120,Perfect location,"This was an ideal location for us as we explored London for the first time. We were a very easy walk away from the Globe Theatre, the Thames, and the tube. My 13 year old and I shared a room with two twin beds, they were very comfortable and the room was a great place to refresh after our long days of sightseeing. The Wagamama restaurant across the street had a lot of vegetarian options and we enjoyed eating there a few times during our stay.",5,2018,09,11
120,Very nice hotel,"The location is great! 5 minute walk to Thames, 10 - 15 to Tower Bridge, 5 minute walk to the tube. Nice in-hotel bar and restaurant. Staff were very cordial. Food/room service was excellent. Prices are all reasonable. Rooms are very small but this is not unique to Hilton. 

I used the app and my HH account to select a room before arriving. When I arrived, I was told the previous guest was no longer leaving and denied the type of room I had selected. I felt the hotel should have accommodated us with a comparable or better room since we had successfully made a reservation. Ended up being put in a room that faces a brick wall/receives little to no natural sunlight. Try to avoid those rooms if at all possible. In combination with the size, the lack of light and external sound make the room feel dark and isolated. Could be a plus if you are a very light sleeper.",4,2018,09,10
120,Staff are amazing!,"Stayed at the Hilton Bankside for only one night but I could not fault it! The beds are divine and especially the staff are amazing! Alex in the bar is so lovely and knowledgeable, he made our night extra special. Adolfo in Oxbo restaurant was equally nice, explaining everything perfectly and so attentive. Also John the concierge was great, a little cheeky (in a good way!) and so helpful, even having my bags and coat ready before I had to ask for them. All in all a great experience, and please treasure your staff, they are incredible! - Kim",5,2018,09,09
120,Great Staff! Great location.,"Would stay again.  Little bit pricey but worth it. Great staff, especially the Concierge. Very clean rooms. Breakfast was great,  fresh and delicious.  Omelet bar was a plus! We enjoyed that every morning.",5,2018,09,08
120,Good location and cozy hotel,"Beautiful hotel and located in a very good location. 

Everything just in the walking distance. 

Stayed in a Deluxe room and the room is clean. Room is wide and spacious. 
However, I dont really like the lighting in this property.Its too dark for me and I prefer bright room. The window is small too and kind of made people feel depress.

Love their bathroom.",4,2018,09,08
120,Fantastic Hotel with exceptional service,"Spent six nights here in September 2018,  Stayed in a suite with access to the Executive Lounge ... great breakfasts with snacks and drinks all day long.  The service in the lounge was always good ... but it was exceptional when Debra Lipsenmere was on duty.",5,2018,09,07
120,We LOVED it here!,"Every single person at the front desk, Restaurant/Bar and the doorman were outstanding!  Every time you opened the door into the lobby someone sad hello or good morning.  The place is nice, clean and very central to the tube stops, Tate Modern museum, and places to eat.  I would recommend this hotel without a doubt!",5,2018,09,05
120,Weekend break,"I stayed with my husband for 2 nights over a weekend, stylish hotel, very nice interior. Room was comfortable, clean modern bathroom with rainfall shower. The staff were friendly and helpful, breakfast staff in particular very diligent and polite. Refreshing to stay in a hotel where every member of staff you pass greets you warmly. A mention also to the housekeeping staff who left our room spotless. Breakfast was lovely, very nice buffet selection. Did not have time to make use of the pool or gym. Location could not be better, close to Southwark station for the underground. The Globe, Milennium Bridge and St Paul’s Cathedral all close by. Will definitely stay here again when we return to London. ",5,2018,09,04
120," Comfy relaxing stay","I stayed here for couple of nights. Hilton Bankside has a great location; walking distance to Southwark, London Bridge and Blackfriars tubes. The hotel is fairly new, rooms are great and comfy; breakfast is excellent. Had a very nice stay here ",4,2018,09,04
120,Super cool modern hotel ,I LOVED this hotel! Everything is new and modern.. we had a great room the view was also nice with a view of the city and although it was viewing the metro you could not hear any noise . We were celebrating my husbands birthday they even sent a cake to the room which was also nice . The executive lounge is amazing with lots of tasty snacks and they have a tea time and a happy hour.. we had breakfast in the main dining room it was also fabulous with soo many choices and a guy making omlettes .. the set up was really beautiful also . The location was perfect we walked to most sites its also close to the metro stations to go anywhwre else . We did use the indoor pool which was very clean and the water was also a good temperature.. the spa area also looked very nice but we didnt have time to do any treatments .. the staff was also very helpful and friendly ... this is a great choice if you are visiting london :) ,5,2018,09,03
120,Great Experience,"This was our first visit to London and this Hilton didn’t disappoint. Staff was very friendly. The location is awesome. Close to a couple of Tube stations and an easy  walk to many sites. The lounge is one of the best I’ve ever experienced at a Hilton property. Nice, modern, clean rooms. We will definitely stay at this hotel again. ",5,2018,09,03
120,"Excellent hotel, but not close to the tube","My partner and I stayed at the Hilton Bankside in July 2018 for four nights.
The hotel is very central, although not particularly close to a tube or train station so a little bit of a walk is required when you need public transport. They put us on level one which was a bit disappointing as we had no view and a heap of whirring machines outside kept up a buzz.
The room was clean, a good size, and the king bed was comfy. The bathroom was modern and had a volume control for the tv speaker in there - we didn’t have a bath, but the shower was really good and I loved the mirror over the sink that was hanging by a belt strap.
We opted to walk to Borough market for breakfast rather than pay for food at the hotel as breakfast seemed dear, but I've heard good things.
We actually got engaged during our stay, and I kept the champagne bottle and cork from the proposal as souvenirs, and told the guy at reception to tell the cleaner not to throw it out - just to be sure. For some reason this was lost in translation (as I don’t think the guy spoke good English despite being on front desk!) and they kept all our plastic water bottles we’d put in the bin, and threw our champagne bottle and cork out!! It was bizarre, especially since the champagne bottle was next to a ring box and flowers!! Anyway I went down to reception and they managed to find the champagne bottle and cork undamaged so that was a relief!! They also gave us a delicious dessert with “congratulations” spelled out in chocolate which was pretty kind. 
I would consider staying here again, but I would request not to be on the first floor.
Hopefully this review was helpful :-)",5,2018,09,03
120,"Very nice, lovely and clean.","We have only stayed one night but we have had a lovely time. Hotel room is very clean, bed is very comfy. 
The food in the restaurant was amazing, my duck was cooked to perfection the waiter was so helpful with my dietary requirements. 
Only one thing that i wasnt happy with was our breakfast waiter, no hello, no can i get you a drink, he didnt say one word. Shame.",4,2018,09,03
120,Excellent Service ,"Happy to return anytime front office staff very helpful,rooms big and airy great location lots of restaurants around and a two minute walk to the river.
Pleasant staff make a hotel and other big brands just don’t see this.
",5,2018,09,01
120,Weekend away,Stayed here with my friend for 1 night on a Saturday. The breakfast was fantastic and exec lounge one of the best I have been to at Hilton. Staff very helpful and friendly. Bedrooms are great quality and the bed was very comfy. Shame there is no sauna or steam room as that would have given it 5 stars.,4,2018,08,28
120,Perfect hotel for exploring London,What a great hotel for our first time in London. The location was great. The room was so quiet and comfortable. We could walk many places but there was a tube station near (Southwark ). We used the executive lounge and the staff was so friendly. We would definitely stay here again. ,5,2018,08,27
120,An excellent hotel,"Excellent hotel and facilities! The aroma as you entered the foyer was exquisite, a fabulous touch! Excellent staff, very helpful and always available. The bar had an extensive range of gins and the table service added an extra touch to the service. The food options for breakfast were excellent and thourghly delicious.",5,2018,08,27
120,Weekend trip,"The hotel is in great location on southbank not far from the globe.
Easy to find coming in on tube. Southwark station being the closest.
Room was great, large flatscreen, comfortable beds and tea and coffee making facilities. Loved free pop from local producers - a nice touch. 
Bathroom was beautiful and shower was amazing.
Would def consider staying again.",4,2018,08,27
120,"Fantastic hotel, offering a first class stay.","The sheer number of five star reviews for the Hilton Bankside says it all. 

From the moment we arrived we were impressed. The journey in to London had for one reason or anther been fairly stressful that morning, and the local car park was full, but the concierge was excellent and handled our car for us with no fuss, allowing us to get on with our break. 

After checking in we had a great spot of lunch in the bar. Great food, and helpful first class service all round.

Following a visit up the west end, we headed back to the hotel to enjoy the spa, which is a wonderful place to relax. We practically had the place to ourselves despite it being a bank holiday weekend. Beautifully done, and spotlessly clean.

Our room was quite frankly fantastic! Huge by London standards, again beautifully decorated and extremely comfortable. Could not fault it in anyway.

All in all it’s easy to understand why Hilton Bankside scores so highly with travellers, the same wonderful service you would expect from the brand, matched with a property that sets a new standard for Hilton. First class all round! 

",5,2018,08,27
120,Great hospitality at Hilton London Bankside,"My current stay at Hilton London Bankside is so wonderful I can’t wait for the survey.  With this being my first time in London, Gergely the hospitality attendant in the lounge has absolutely made my stay heartwarming and with a feeling of home away from home.  This is not to mention that he is from another country himself, Hungary.  Along with his care of the patrons, he remembers details and caters towards your individual needs and is courteous to all.  I watched as he helped parents with calming tired and irritated children.  He put smiles on their faces as he did mine just watching.  Also, I saw beneath the care, a professionalism that said he knows his craft and should be mentoring others and managing these type of hospitality rooms.  One of the people I saw listening to him in a mentor relationship, Debra, seemed to follow his advice and I watched as she too made everyone she encountered feel special.  Beneath the professionalism this is what hospitality is supposed to be.  Gergely and Debra are examples of reasons that make me consider Hilton.",5,2018,08,26
120,Perfect hotel for sightseeing in London!,"This hotel is wonderful and I'd definitely stay here again!  It's very close to the Tate Modern and you can take a scenic boat ride to the Tate Britain.  The hotel is very elegant and there are tons of good restaurants near-by.  Mark Kis, the concierge, is fabulous!!!  He advised us on obtaining Oyster cards, told us the best way to get theatre tickets, and arranged a black car for us back to the airport!  And he was just the nicest guy ever.",5,2018,08,24
120,Great modern Hilton,"I stayed at this hotel whilst on business in London, convenient location close to Waterloo Station. I had an extremely pleasant stay, the room was incredibly quiet given it was the centre of London, the rooms are very modern and comfortably furnished, I would absolutely recommend.",5,2018,08,23
120,Excellent Stay in Bankside,"We have stayed there before and every time we are very happy to have a customer service that is really good. Break fast in the morning is one of the best in London. Also, pool in Central London is amazing. We would stay there again !",5,2018,08,23
120,Perfect location,"Having been to London twice this year and both times staying at Hilton bankside it will probably be the only hotel I use while in London from now on.
For me it’s the perfect location, just over the bridge from the hustle and bustle of central London the hotel is situated on a quieter street just across from the Tate modern, walking distance to borough market, Shakespeare’s gloves, with plenty pubs and restaurants scattered about. Tube station just a 5 min walk from hotel so very handy to get around.
Staff were exceptional as always, lovely big rooms, high power air conditioning for those sweaty summer nights, decent cocktail bar next to reception that do really tasty G&T’s and late bar food, pool and gym were on the small side but did the job, and they have a car park!
Definitely will be back ",5,2018,08,22
120,Excellent. Consistently. ,"My second time at this Hilton and it was every bit as good as last time. Great staff, big room, comfortable bed, walk-in rain shower and fast, reliable WiFi. The restaurant is excellent both for breakfast and dinner. I literally have nothing bad to say about this place - long may it last! ",5,2018,08,21
120,"Lovely rooms, brilliant stay","Excellent service on arrival. I had a room on the Executive floor which was very nice. Clean, modern, and spacious. I didn't eat in the Hotel but did have a couple of drinks in the executive lounge and breakfast in the morning which was very good. The swimming pool was one of the nicer ones I've visited and was very sleek. I would definitely stay here again and recommend it wholeheartedly. ",5,2018,08,21
120,Another enjoyable visit!,"Our favourite London Hilton - as diamond members we always choose here.  Good, well run executive lounge where we were delighted to be looked after by Gergely again.  Always find him exceptionally professional, friendly, charming and attentive.  Staff as polite and helpful as always throughout the hotel.  Much appreciated...",5,2018,08,21
120,London Stay,"Hilton Bankside has great staff who are very attentative. The hotel is clean, fresh and welcoming. The location is not central to the tourist spots, which is a plus if you like to be away. It isn't far from the main spots to see. ",5,2018,08,20
120,Keeping in the lead,Having stayed at the Tower Bridge Hilton last week Bankside still excels at being my best place to stay in London.  Staff are really pleased to serve you and I’ll give a shout out to Dylan in OXBO for his enthusiasm & professionalism.  Room as ever well presented and again many thanks to housekeeping for their well appreciated efforts.  ,5,2018,08,20
120,Comfortable stay - Fantastic,"We booked this hotel as a walk as a special treat for our family on a special day. The  lady on reception (Rada I think) couldn't have been more helpful. She went out of her way to accommodate us and be helpful. 
We stayed in a suite looking right at the Shard. The room was spotlessly clean with great facilities. They even catered for our children who were very excited to have a welcome pack in the room.
We used the executive lounge and couldn't fault this in anyway. It was friendly nd well stocked with a relaxed atmosphere.

Overall the service throughout the the hotel was fantastic and our stay was very enjoyable and couldn't be faulted.
If you want to treat yourself and leave felling relaxed stay here we loved. Thankyou for great stay it made our stay very special",5,2018,08,19
120,Lounge,"Great executive lounge and service. Served daily by Gergely. Always friendly and he went above and beyond to ensure my wife and I had everything we needed. Overall the hotel was excellent, modern and clean rooms. Staff was friendly and did an excellent job overall. Hotel was also quiet and fairly close to all major attractions.",5,2018,08,19
120,Our new go-to hotel in London,"Had an overnight stay with my partner before flying back home. I wish we would have booked this hotel for the beginning of our trip instead of the DoubleTree Victoria. 

The hotel was amazing, top to bottom and from check-in to check-out. The lobby is beautiful and modern, just like the rooms. Top notch service from the entire staff and the waiters in the restaurant. 

Our room was very clean and well-stocked. The window was small, but had a nice view looking towards the Tate. They welcomed us with cookies and a friendly note. The breakfast was one of the best throughout our entire trip (we only booked Hilton properties). The executive lounge was also very nice and had many options during happy hour and breakfast. 

The location is also very good! It was easy to get to from the train we took from Gatwick. Also very easy to walk to the tube. Near the river, next door to the Tate & the Globe, and about a 10-minute walk from Borough Market. Many dining options nearby.",5,2018,08,18
120,Great stay in London,"Stayed overnight and really impressed with the service and attention. Quiet, spacious executive room with access to a good lounge where we had tea followed later by drinks and snacks. Busy at breakfast but good selection of food including Indian dishes.
Everybody very helpful and willing to please. Very clean and well maintained. Not a budget hotel but certainly ticked all our boxes. Will go again if opportunity arises. Handy for the Globe Theatre.",5,2018,08,18
120,Polished,"Very much unlike the usual Hilton experience, in my opinion. This is a meticulously designed room - stylish finishes, minimal layout, very carefully and thoughtfully planned, everything where it should be, ergonomically a pleasure, and a most pleasant stay. The service is up to 5 star standards too. Located adjacent to the Tate Modern, and a short walk from Borough Market. 
Small quibbles:  the bar fridge is a bit noisy, wired ethernet did not work (i don't want to radiate myself with wi-fi thanks), and when I plugged my ethernet cable into the ethernet port on the desk, the telephone stopped working -- so some things to sort out there). Otherwise, a very fine hotel.",5,2018,08,18
120,Comfortable night's stay in a lovely room,"Many hotels have a beautiful reception area and disappointingly bland rooms.  This one however was different.  Lovely room, great attention to detail, lots of complimentary items. Very comfortable stay and very clean.  Great value for money in London. Would definitely stay again. ",5,2018,08,14
120,Very solid hotel,"We had a great experience at this property. Got upgraded to a suite, which was nice.  I wasn’t a huge fan of the room layout and style, but it was comfortable enough.  Location is much better than it seemed at first.  Short walk to the tube, but central. 

All the staff were great.",5,2018,08,13
120,perfect holiday,"Perfect place to relax and discover London,
  rooms comfortable and very quiet,
quality drinks and food, the swimming pool extra comfort.
Special thanks to Gergely Müller and Márk Kis who helped us with the executive lounge and concierge service; theater tickets, table reservations and much more ...
I felt like a Queen ...",5,2018,08,12
120,Almost perfect holiday accommodation.,"I stayed for a week during  the very high temperatures in July and found the Hotel almost perfect.  I understand that this Hotel was only recently opened and it looked it.  Staff very friendly.  Air conditioning perfect throughout. Breakfast extensive and high quality.  Pool perfect for a cool-down.  Extensive and lively bar.  Large well equipped room with Tea, Coffee and Water on hand.  Tasty nibbles were left in the room each night (as if I needed them!)  While on the south side of the river but well located for the Underground and Water Taxis.

A minor, but sometimes annoyning point, was that on a number of ocasions the room was not serviced until 6 o'clock.
",5,2018,08,10
120,Excellent accomdations,Fresh .new and conveniently located near underground stations and bus routes. We spent three nights and four days in London after a British Isles cruise at this hotel. We are recommending it to our friends and neighbors for their upcoming visit.,3,2018,08,09
120,Absolutely lovely,"This hotel is fantastic! The room was by far the nicest room I have ever stayed in. Everyone was extremely nice and accommodating, even the concierge came outside with us to show us how to get somewhere. The location is awesome, with a short walk to Borough Market and the London Bridge. The only downfall was the fitness room, it was very small and ill equipped, however that is something so minor and does not affect too many people. The breakfast is also horribly expensive, but that's to be expected at a place this nice. If you are coming to London, I highly recommend this hotel.",5,2018,08,07
120,Nice hotel,"I was impressed with this hotel.  The area has gone through urban regeneration, attracting new restaurants, bars, cafes etc. The hotel décor was modern and lightning throughout the hotel was quite dark.  The room was average size for London and was modern and comfortable. I felt the lighting in the room could be brighter but it followed the theme of the hotel.  The room was well equipped with plenty of plugs and USB ports. WiFi was fast.

Breakfast in the hotel was good, plenty of choice and quality.  I suspect it gets very busy later in the morning, as despite it being near empty when I arrived, I was seated between 2 occupied tables.
",5,2018,08,06
120,London day break,"I stayed in this hotel for just one night, the check in time is at 3pm, I arrived at 12:30. The room was ready, and I was able to get to the room assigned after checking in. 
Hotel is clean and staff were friendly even the housekeeping staff. Short walking distance from Southwark tube station.
There were complimentary drinks and biscuits and tea making facilities.
The body wash, shampoos and body cream were Crabtree and Evelyn , what a treat!
From this time on this will be my hotel choice when in London.",5,2018,08,06
120,Awesome Unique Hotel,"I had been staying at the Hilton Tower Bridge and on a recent trip stayed at the Bankside Hilton. I actually found the executive lounge, on site restaurant and on site bar to be so much better. The area is a bit more neighborhood style vs Tower Bridger location but not so much any differentiator. While the executive lounge at Tower Bridge is on the roof top which is very cool, it is very small. The rooms at Bankside are excellent and I can say same for Tower Bridge. Definitely will be coming back.",5,2018,08,06
120,"Good choice, if a little pricey","Spent two nights here last weekend. Very new hotel, cool decor, and great staff throughout. % mins walk to the Thames, Tate Modern, and St Pauls. Seems to be an up and coming area, with a good choice of places to eat nearby (Mercato Metropolitan was very cool and packed). Ate in the restaurant first night and the food was good - but nearly cost a ton!
Rooms have great air conditioning (a must for us, especially this summer), the beds were very comfy, and the black outs worked well. Had a little noise on Saturday night, not sure if it was from a wedding downstairs or elsewhere, but despite being a very light sleeper it didn't bother us. Had water and pop in the fridge for us, and there are plugs and charger sockets next to the bed (another must these days). Shower had great pressure although the bathroom might be a little dark for some (fine for me). Only gripe I can think of is that there is no safe in the room, which I find remarkable in this day an age. Having to take your valuables to reception every time you leave the room is just barmy. Not sure why this was overlooked when the hotel has everything else. Wifi was good and free.",4,2018,08,06
120,Simply Wonderfull . .,"Our bolt hole in London. Have been coming here since the hotel opened. No room upgrade with our Diamond status this time, but even the lowest category rooms are loverly. Prior to using Bankside we used Park Lane Hilton for 20 years and watched the slow deterioration of a once great hotel, however, the good thing is that the deterioration of the London Hilton made us seek out somewhere else and Bankside was recommended so wallop, here we are. The breakfast is the best Hilton breakfast in the UK, by a long way. The staff ooze service and quality and the Executive Lounge is the best in Europe. We are sad to leave however, we now have something to look forward to leading up to our next visit ..   ",5,2018,08,06
120,Great Stay - Loved the Location,"We had a fantastic 3-night pre-cruise stay at the Hilton Bankside.  In our last visit we stayed in the Mayfair area which was closer to some of the sites, but we really enjoyed the South Bank location.  It worked out well for visiting Tate Modern (especially 10th floor view) and the Globe Theatre.  With the great weather, we also had some nice walks to the Tower Bridge, London Eye, Borough Market etc. - often on the river walk. It was also a nice stroll to the Southwark tube station.

The hotel itself was very professional and we received excellent service all around.  The king room was spotless and clean.  With HH gold we received a complimentary buffet breakfast which was fantastic - both in variety as well as quality.   I would highly recommend the Hilton Bankside and we look forward to staying there again in future trips.",5,2018,08,05
120,Excellent stay,"We were in London for 10 nights. 5 nights in Hilton bankside, 5 nights in Hilton waldorf London. We enjoyed more here in bankside.Everything here is better except location. Staffs are outstanding and very helpfull. ",5,2018,08,05
120,My best destination in London,"I do always stay at the Hilton London Bankside when in London. Excellent service, fabulous lounge, nice swimming pool. All perfect. Staff taking care of all of your requests. Thank you to all of them.
The hotel is 200 meters from Tate Modern and the Thames. Millenium bridge and the City is walking distance. ",5,2018,08,01
120,Amazing,"Hotel is located 5 minutes walk from Metro station, which makes it accessible to entire London. We took a family room and stayed for 2 nights. Hotel has simple and modern design in which all needs are considered. We had access to the lounge where breakfast was served. We were in a different Hilton Hotel and left it with some disappointing remarks but Bankside is truly excellent. All staff is very helpful and attentive. I highly recommend this hotel to everyone whether your trip is business or leisure.",5,2018,07,31
120,"Fabulous Hotel with Attentive Staff, Wonderful Executive Lounge and Great Location Near the Tube!","My husband and our two teenaged grandsons stayed at this lovely property and could not have been happier!  The staff is welcoming and makes you feel like valued guests.  I made a number of special requests and all of them were handled professionally and warmly.  We booked an Executive Suite which was large and comfortable.  Our bedroom was nicely appointed and our grandsons declared that their couch pullout bed felt like a normal, comfy bed.  Our room had a full bath with a separate shower and tub and a nice array of amenities.  The boys also had a half-bath which came in handy.  The boys received gift bags on arrival and they were filled with goodies from stuffed toys to jelly beans.The Executive Lounge is blessed with friendly staff who went out of their ways for us.  Breakfast was ample and yummy.  With all of the appetizers and beverages in the evening at the Executive Lounge, we found that we could relax at the hotel and have plenty to eat and drink without going out for dinner.  After busy days of sightseeing, the value of the Executive Lounge could not be overestimated.  The concierge also looked after us with care.  We have been to London many times but after the experience at this property, we will only stay at the Hilton London Bankside in the future.  We are members of the Hilton Rewards program and this Hilton property is our favorite.  We also enjoyed the convenience of the tube station which was a five minute walk away.  We loved this property!  Hats off to the excellent management and staff!",5,2018,07,31
120,Beautiful Hotel near Shakespeare’s Globe,"The Hilton Bankside is the kind of hotel which makes you feel welcome without making a fuss. Service is very friendly, helpful and most important unobtrusive. The short distance to the Globe theatre makes it the perfect place to stay for Shakespeare enthusiasts. ",5,2018,07,31
120,Great first impression in London,"This was my first stop in London, and i have to say i was pleasantly surprised. I have had really mixed reviews staying in Hilton properties, however this is one of the good experiences by far. 

The staff are very friendly, never did i feel pressure for being a tourist having to tip, or stupid for asking what would seem obvious questions. 

The hotel itself is situated right near a subway station, (about a 5 min walk) which will connect you to the greater city within about 15 minutes. The trains come every 3 minutes or so. 

The hotel was new! Rooms were clean, no marks on linen or towels, no dust in the room, everything was clean and neat. I had the executive club room which granted me access to the executive lounge. 

Its the type of Hotel, if you call and ask them to make your room because you are going to be out for an hour or so, they come and do it in that time. I really liked this level of service.

If you are planning to stay in your hotel for breakfast, i would recommend spending a little extra and staying in one of these types of rooms as the breakfast in the executive lounge was more than adequate. My only criticism is the lounge itself featured velvet or velour seats. As you can imagine, if people were to spill food (which some did), they stain, you could notice these stains. 

Gym and pool were AMAZING facilities, very modern and new.

View from my room was a little disappointing, however as i chose to stay slightly out of the city, it was warranted.

Checkout was easy, the whole process was seamless.",5,2018,07,31
120,Great stay,I go to London 2-3 times a year for work.  This was my first time staying at this hotel and I loved it!  Booked an Executive room and glad I did as it was much larger than standard rooms and came with access to their excellent Executive lounge.  Great air conditioning in the room which is important to me and not always easy to find in Europe.  Nice bathroom.  Good service.  Great location.  I'll be back for sure.,5,2018,07,30
120,A splendid stay,"This is a very modern hotel, located on the south bank of the river Thames, within walking distance of Tate modern and the Globe. The closest tube station is Southwark, about five minutes away on foot. We had two inter-connecting rooms, which is ideal for families. Children are well catered for and made to feel very welcome. My daughter (nine years old) was very pleased with the kid-sized bath robe and slippers, as well as the welcome pack (complete with a small teddy). There is also a treasure hunt to locate 31 fox figurines throughout the lobby, bar/cafe and restaurant area, which my daughter really enjoyed completing. The staff are very friendly, helpful, welcoming and very polite. The breakfast is great, with plenty to choose from. My favourite was the fruit bar. Overall, we had a great stay. My daughter added her own review:’The hotel is outstanding! You can have a interconnecting room or one with lounge access. The pool facilities are really nice. The breakfast is really nice having a lot of range to choose from. The hotel is really nice and the staff couldn’t be more friendly. There is a fox hunt and if you find all the foxes you will get a bag of sweets. There is also a kids goodie bag with a teddy bear, activities and much more! They also have kids fluffy slippers and a kids fluffy bathrobe. The bar has drinks which are beautifully presented and the apple juice has dried apple on top. What a lovely decoration. The closest tube station is Southwark. I rate it 5 stars.’",5,2018,07,28
120,Wonderful Visit,"The Hilton London Bankside is a hotel I would highly recommend for those who are visiting London. Upon arriving we took a room upgrade which was available on the spot at 1:30pm. We also got access to the executive lounge where free afternoon tea was served (which we loved) and free drinks from the minibar which was great. The staff were very nice and conscientious doing everything they could to make our stay the best possible. 

We had a beautiful room on the second floor that was extremely clean and quite large. If you are able to get a good deal on the upgrade I would take it, the room was big with a full living room, two bathrooms and a king sized bed. This hotel made our first two nights in London much more luxurious and would definitely recommend to any travelers especially international.",5,2018,07,24
120,Birthday treat ,"The hotel has a really funky and quirky entrance. On arrival our room was not ready so we were asked to wait in lounge. The staff on reception and in lounge were super friendly and helpful. 

Our room was ready however the keycards did not work; it wasn’t the best start but Reception sent a few glasses of sparkling wine for the two delays.

The room was spacious with good bathroom amenities. Very comfy bed.

Pool was disappointing with a jacuzzi in pool which didn’t really do much. Wish I’d not wasted my time going. 

Good location easy walkable to shops and the river. 

Breakfast was very nice with huge selection. The evening drinks in executive lounge were also good.

The hotel is not cheap but I’d stay again... just not waste time in pool!",4,2018,07,23
120,One of the best business-class hotels in London,"I've stayed in more than a dozen hotels in London. The Hilton Bankside is absolutely one of the very best. In fact, it feels more like a modern high-end luxury hotel.

The rooms are remarkably quiet, with good black-out curtains, comfortable beds, and good (and quiet) air conditioning, so we slept great. The rooms are slightly larger than many London hotels in this price range, they look great, and they have plenty of outlets for our gadgets. The bathroom is comfortable, attractive, and highly functional. 

Breakfast was great all three days we were there. The buffet was outstanding, with plenty of hot and cold options, cooked-to-order options, pastries, and juices. And, all of the food was very tasty and fresh, and the service was excellent from host to server.

The hotel is a 7-8 minute walk to Southwark station, 12-15 minutes to Borough station, and 15 minutes to St. Paul's Cathedral across the Millennium bridge. My wife, kids, and I all felt quite safe walking around this area.

The hotel staff were all very helpful, friendly, professional and accommodating. And, the hotel was able to get my kids' room located close to my wife and me, as well as honor the other location requests in our reservation.

As someone who spends 80+ nights a year on the road, I really wish all hotels were this excellent.",5,2018,07,22
120,Excellent stay,"Amazing hotel from start to finish. Fantastic service, great room, Complimentary birthday cake for my birthday, comfy bed, in bathroom music, rainshower, blackout curtains, iron, hairdryer! 10 minute walk to Bourough Market. It's brilliant! Lovely getaway for the weekend and would return.",5,2018,07,22
120,New and Modern yet too dark,"This property is fairly new with a compact entrance yet a welcoming lobby, the staff is friendly and always eager to please. Check in experience didn’t go as smoothly, being a Hilton Honors Diamond member who checked in two days ago with the Hilton App I had to wait almost half an hour to get the room that was originally assigned to me but was not ready even at 5pm for which I was compensated with some points, no upgrade was given but I had the option of a continental breakfast in the lounge located on the lobby floor or a full breakfast buffet @ the restaurant located next to the lounge (oxbo). 
The room was located on the 7th floor, to my surprise the wait for a room on the higher floor didn’t pay off because for some reason the way this hotel was designed it appears lighting the place up with more windows and natural light was not a preference. The hallways have an eerie dark feel to them which gave me a very dull impression of the hotel, as I entered the room the same dark theme followed in, the room was quite modern with all required amenities and a good size bed, the bathroom was one of the best I have seen in recent times (stunning) but what put me off the most is the view from a tiny window located at the right corner of the room, the rest of the wall which could have had floor to ceiling windows would have made a huge difference and would have lit up the room but instead it was just concrete covered with curtains. 
The southwark underground station is a good 10 min walk but I didn’t mind that. The breakfast buffet at Oxbo was the highlight of my stay it was a super nice spread of all breakfast necessities and their carrot pomegranate juice was worth waking up for. The staff at the restaurant I must say was warm and welcoming and gave great service, its a breakfast experience even worth paying for.
My final verdict is if you are willing to try a new modern (dark themed) hotel with not so amazing views then go for it but know this that this is not by any means a more economical option, they charge a hefty price compared to some of the more central hotels in better locations. ",4,2018,07,18
120,Pleasant stay ,"Me and my husband enjoyed 2 nights at Hilton bankside, our room was clean and comfortable and the hotel has a very modern feel to it. Would definitely stay here again. Please note that there is no free onsite parking. ",5,2018,07,18
120,Modern hotel in a good location,"Spent 4 nights (Sunday-Thursday).
Hotel has modern amenities for business travellers.
Spacious room; excellent breakfast; large and hospitable lounge.
Staff is friendly and accommodates special requests.
Nice bar on site.",5,2018,07,18
120," Very nice hotel","The hotel is very clean, new and luxury. Beds are very comfortable. You can make the rooms totally dark with the think heavy curtains to have better sleep in the morning, something that I care about a lot and could not do in many hotels. Kids and us had great sleep despite jet lags. 

The location is also good. Many attractions are in walking distance and it’s also close to subway station. 

The staff are all great. Very polite and attentive. Notably, I want to point out Gergely in the Lounge area. His service was great, even one night he stayed a little bit longer than his shift to show us some attractions and give us info for our next trip to hungry.",5,2018,07,17
120,I love this venue,"With Hilton the standard is usually ok with some pleasant an some unpleasant surprises. This hotel is pleasant surprise. Rooms are spacious for London standard clean and comfortable. Service is as good as Parklane, but price ratio is much better. And close to the river, close to Shakespeare’s globe,  within walking distance of the London eye and Big Ben it is at a great central location. ",5,2018,07,16
120,Great hotel in a great location,"My fiancée and I stayed here for 3 nights; such a nice, new looking hotel. 
Room had everything we needed and we had access to the executive lounge which put a great spread on each night during the evening drinks. 

The lady on reception arranged for a cake to be sent to our room the evening we arrived to congratulate us on our engagement; a very nice touch. 

Rada on reception was very helpful when I needed to print out some documents which wouldn’t work in the business centre. 

I would highly recommend staying in this hotel for those travelling to London and desire a convienent location.",5,2018,07,14
120,The best Hilton I've been at,"My husband and I visited this hotel for a short London break. I always find Hilton hotels great but this one was fabulous. It's a lovely new hotel so the rooms are lovely with great decor. The staff are also wonderful - right from the firsr contact from the wonderful receptionist who checked us in - it was very personal and we felt very special. I would highly recommend paying more for an exec room with lounge access - the extras you get in there are fabulous. It has a fabulous high tea, lovely snacks and drinks in the evening and a great selection for breakfast. This is by far the best exec lounge I have been in worldwide and special mention to Gergely (I hope I have his name right) - what a host and a lovely person. Congratulations and a massive thanks to everyone with making our stay just lovely- whether behind the scenes or front of house - you are a credit to the industry and to the Hilton brand.",5,2018,07,13
120,My new favourite hotel in London,"I stayed here for a conference and was really impressed - for me, the service is on a par with the Conrad, incredibly pleasant staff. The rooms are fine, not as opulent as the Conrad but with comfy beds and good modern showers. The breakfast is excellent, if only they would do breakfast in the room for the tray charge it would be perfect.

Great location for walking the South Bank too.",5,2018,07,13
120,"Good, but very overpriced!","I stayed at this hotel for one night whilst on business in London.  Location is fantastic and everything in the city is easily accessible from the hotel.
On arrival I was checked in swiftly, although slightly stiff and very formal approach which I just don't!  Why do hotels still insist on this sir and madam lark, I much prefer a more laid back attitude, it was very robotic with breakfast times being advised, location of everything etc, etc.  None the less the receptionist was courteous and friendly.
The rooms at this hotel are not like any other rooms I've seen in a Hilton, very much appealing to the hipster trendy crowd which I like but my personal opinion is they're very dark.  I'm they look nice and cozy in the winter but in the peak of summer I found the room just looked a bit sad, grey wall coverings, an odd green colour on the curtains and the carpet was a geometric print and a lot of wood everywhere.  It is pleasant but I can't imagine a lady coping well to do makeup.
I didn't use the restaurant at the hotel and chose to eat out, breakfast the next morning however was very typical of Hilton with an abundance of choice on offer all of which was decent quality and the service was good and not intrusive.
Overall I found the hotel is very much style over substance and that's obviously what draws people to it, sadly it's not my taste but it was perfectly pleasant if a little overpriced, at just short of £400.  I usually stay at a five star hotel in Westminster and it is less than half of what it costs here and has more facilities.
Would I stay here again, yes but for leisure as my partner would love the hotel.  For business it just didn't cut it and I can't justify paying £400 again for one night.  Thankfully this time I made the excuse of Wimbledon but even still £400 for a Hilton is steep when The Mayfair Hotel where selling rooms for under £200.",4,2018,07,12
120,Weekend Break,"Had a lovely stay at this great hotel, fantastic location with great amenities highly reccomend for a shoe break to London.
Thankyou to Anthonybotr Antonio who looked after us for breakfast, charming young man who looked after my wife who has difficulty walking.

Praise where praise is due.",5,2018,07,10
120,Wonderful hotel,"I was taken here for my birthday weekend and it was such a great hotel. We paid a little extra for the executive option which gave us breakfast, afternoon tea, alcohol and canapés.
We dined in the hotel restaurant on the first night and that was lovely and good staff and great food.
The room was spacious, clean and modern with a free mini bar as also part of the executive package.
We used the pool and had it to ourselves that was very nice.
It’s a great location, staff are very friendly and helpful, price was what I would expect.
I will be returning here for another stay without a doubt.",5,2018,07,09
120,Great hotel in the middle of bustling Bankside,"Whilst there's now a cluster of hotels (almost all on the same block) in Bankside, the Hilton justifies its five star rating with a distictly upmarket feel.
The most impressive feature is the service - bags whisked out of your hand as you arrive, a concierge on tap, and staff who are interested in being helpful (horrifically rare in London these days). Add to that, new rooms with all mod cons and miraculous sound-proofing, a superb gin bar and resturant, and a walkable location for anywhere from Waterloo to London Bridge. No wonder it's buzzing.",5,2018,07,09
120,A great hotel in a great London location,"Modern hotel. Great location near Thames River, Tate Modern gallery, Globe Theater and lots of nice restaurants. Staff super nice. Excellent breakfast. Has a nice pool and gym. Room is nice size, great shower. We had a view of a brick wall but did not want to pay extra for an outward view.",5,2018,07,09
120,Excellent hotel in that category,"I was very pleasantly surprised by this Hilton property. The lobby area as well as the rooms and the general ambience are all very stylish and modern and the service of all staff was friendly and efficient.The rooms were furthermore very comfortable, the bathrooms modern, great showers, nice and comfy beds and bedding etc. I could not find any fault. Compared with other Hilton properties in the same category, this is a gem. Will def stay here again when in London and in the Bankside area.",5,2018,07,08
120,Fabulous,"Had a great one night stay at the Hilton Bankside. It started off well when we checked in and were given Diamond Status for our stay - so had use of the Exec Lounge, which included free breakfast, drinks etc. It was a lovely gesture, and we did use the lounge for coffee and some quiet time before we went out for the day. We had already booked breakfast in the restaurant so can’t tell you what the offer for breakfast was like in the exec lounge - but the coffee was excellent! 

The hotel is well placed for the tube, and is very close to the Tate Modern, The Globe Theatre and the Millennium Bridge.

The staff at the hotel were exceptionally helpful and efficient - but friendly as well. Our room was perfect, with a comfortable bed, robes and slippers. We also had complimentary soft drinks in the room. 

We ate lunch in the Oxbo onsite restaurant, where we also had breakfast. It was incredibly noisy at lunch time, and this was the only negative of the stay for me. We retreated for coffee to the quiet of the Exec lounge and it was heaven! At breakfast it was much quieter and the selection of food was good. 

Overall I would highly recommend this hotel, and will definitely stay again when returning to London.",5,2018,07,05
120,Perfect experience,"A friend of mine and I stayed here for a few nights on our first trip to Europe. The staff was amazing! Very helpful with directing us as first timers from America. We booked a tour through the concierge, which went seamless. Happy hour was fun as many locals came in to watch the World Cup. The rooms are clean, bathrooms are great with nice shower, beds are comfy, and the AC chills perfectly. ",5,2018,07,05
120,London 2018,"Amazing vacation, great location, great service. Very helpful. My husband enjoyed the pool. The food was really good. Rooms were very clean and comfortable. Very near to all train stations. Truly would recommend to anyone ",5,2018,07,04
120,Lots to Like,"Overall enjoyed our stay here. 
Positives are :
The incredibly polished and thoughtful service
Our room was large and quiet with a powerful rain shower
Rate was quite reasonable overall, but one night cost three times that of another night during our stay, still the average rate was fantastic for a five star
Hilton Honors members receive nice little perks
A few Negatives:
No fresh air or tub in rooms
Executive Lounge breakfast average and room is windowless and kept freezing cold
Location was nice but we spent at least £50 daily in taxis getting to the other side of the river to sights and shopping etc.
Do your homework and this just might be the right choice for you.",4,2018,07,02
120,Beautiful luxury hotel in the middle of city,"The hotel is near to the Thames bank with many eateries around . Very well interior decorated and maintained upto a very high standard . The restaurant, bar , pool and the rooms have a sleek look that give a cosy feeling. Very enjoyable stay.",5,2018,07,01
120,Already booked again,Just arrived home from 2 nights in this fabulous hotel and booked another trip already.  Cannot recommend highly enough.  Lovely hotel and great location for visiting anywhere on the South Bank. We stayed in a king room (the most basic) and we couldn't fault it. Used Tesco Clubcard vouchers and exchanged them for Hotels.com and saved lots of money too.  Very easy process.,5,2018,07,01
120,Birthday celebration ,"We stay in a lot of Hilton’s but Once again bankside you out done yourself again, you have to be the best hotel I’ve stayed in in London you always seem to look after us it was a celebration weekend and you really went out of your way to not only upgrade my partners father you also upgraded us! Your all amazing staff and really go out of your way to look after people! And to the young gentleman ( sorry I couldn’t remember his name )working on the Hilton honours on Saturday your one in a million! Thank you all so much and believe me were returning again to come stay! The rooms are amazing and beds are so comfortable I will never stay in another hotel in London! Thank you thank you thank you 👍👍👍👍",5,2018,06,26
120,Still The Best,"Without doubt, my current stay here proved that this is still the best Hilton in London by a long chalk. The most professional staff, excellent breakfast, great/fresh rooms, super exec lounge. Its all a major cut above any other Hilton Branded property in town, without any doubt. Already booked again for next year. Love it.",5,2018,06,26
120,Will come back and hunt the foxes!,"I will come back here any day.  Good food, great place, wonderful staff.  I think this is one place I gave a tip almost all of the time!!!  A friend came to visit me and told me the story of the foxes (you need to book there and get the whole story for yourself) and truly, there is a hunting map (They will give you one at front office) and you can hunt out all the foxes!!

Ah, the wood paneling..  I loved  those.  They give a kind of VIP feeling to the whole place.  Whoever did that.. raised the level of the decor at the hotel.  They are dope, completely.",4,2018,06,24
120,Dissapointing,"Booked deluke twin room as a surprise for my friends 40th.  Also booked a bottomless brunch.  Contacted hotel to ask if they could assist in making my friends birthday special and they responded quickly agreeing to help. Arrived prior to check in and started the day with the bottemless lunch.  Dissapointingly my friends 40th was not even acknowledged by staff as previously arranged. After lunch we went to check in and they had overbooked hotel and never had deluxe twin room that I had previously paid for in FULL! After much debating with one of the unhelpful managers, we had to take a double room & share a bed! I discreetly showed the manager an e-mail I had received from the hotel stating that they would assist in making my friends 40th special, which so far was an epic fail. I was further asked to provide £50 of my own cash as a deposit.  I told them I had already paid in full for the room that I NEVER GOT!, and had paid cash at the bottomless lunch.  I was told it was compulsory, even though I stated that should I plan to buy drinks at the bar I would be paying cash and not setting up any sort if tab.  I HAVE NEVER HEARD ANYTHING LIKD THAT IN MY LIFE AND I HAVE STAYED AT MANY MANY HOTELS!! We then had to wait for a room and when we finally got in after wasting valuable time there was a cake with a small card stating 'Happy birthday'....with MY name on it instead of my friends!! By now there was nothing else to do except try and enjoy the short time I had left in London with my friend and forget the disastrous 1st half of our only day there.  We spent the rest of the day elsewhere as the hotel had left a bad taste in my mouth.  On checking out the next day I asked for my £50 to be returned to me, however they said it would take 2 days to go back in my account.  IT TOOK 1 WEEK!!...and many phone calls to find out where my money was!! I dont think this is legal! TRULY DISSAPOINTING AND SADLY NOT THE DAY/NIGHT I HAD ENVISIONED FOR MY BEST FRIENDS 40TH!!",2,2018,06,21
120,"Amazing staff, great amenities, family friendly, hip area","A truly great hotel... Staff is so polite and professional. Areas are all clean and fresh. Service is great. Just a few tips to reach perfection a) pool area is boiling hot, to the point of suffocation....reminds of a sauna more than a pool, so we left after five minutes   b) breakfast was not as great as I expected...for example no baked beans for fried eggs in England? how come? croissants cold and dry, bread so so, not much children friendly selection of cheese, sliced cheddar/gouda/gruyere would be more widely accepted than goats and brie... Some other points are that windows do not open and rooms are a bit obscure, even though we were lucky to be on the last floor... Overall, a great / quality stay though, and staff made it even better..never missed a smile! A nice memory for me and my daughter!",5,2018,06,20
120,The Best Hilton in the World,"I just spent 7 delightful nights at the Hilton Bankside in London. It is a discrete hotel just behind the Tate Modern. It does not have a spectacular and glitzy lobby, but it is very elegant, with remarkable fresh flower arrangements, and dark tone club-like ambiance. The staff is always in the lookout to help you and make your stay more comfortable. The rooms are extremely well appointed; everything thought through for your comfort. Attention to every detail. Again, nothing showy and trendy (no transparent walls to the shower for instance), but everything for your personal comfort. I loved the showers, with their solid stone base. The pool is narrow but quite a good length for morning laps. 

Leaving towards Paddington to go to Cornwall, I inadvertently left my knapsack in the cab. Thank god, the clever (and honest) cab driver brought it back immediately to the Hilton Bankside. They immediately contacted me, as my train was just leaving Paddington. My bag was sent to me via express courrier. It got it back to my hotel in Cornwall within two days. Thanks to the Hilton crew at Bankside. You were really extraordinary.",5,2018,06,20
120,What a great hotel,"I had never stayed on the bankside of the river, and was a bit apprehensive, but what a wonderful surprise . Perfect location a short stroll away from the banks of the Thames, Tate Modern and over the Millenium bridge you are in the City at St Paul's .  I stayed on the Exec floor, which gave some lovely benefits. Very good breakfast in the spacious lounge, afternoon tea and evening drinks and tasty nibbles. Very big room for London standards and all the staff went out of their way to make my stay as comfortable as possible.  I shared my room with a friend and the sofa bed was made up and I can say that this is by far the most comfortable sofa bed I have ever come across, proper bed quality mattress and the same quality bedlinnen as on the main bed.",5,2018,06,18
120,Favorite hotel in London,"Why you ask?  I'll get to that.  The rooms are very modern and new, the staff is teriffic, the executive lounge has three services - breakfast, tea, and happy hour.  But the best part - breakfast.  The buffet is the best that I have had in all my travels.",5,2018,06,18
120,"It does not get any better, then the Bankside","I been a Diamond or Gold in the Hilton Honors program since 1988, I know my Hiltons. This is a outstanding hotel, but you have to understand, its a hotel that you have take a cab to and from. Its cheaper then the subway, if you have 4 or more and faster. The rooms are large and they have everything you need. If you are only Gold, no Executive Lounge.",5,2018,06,17
120,Lovely stay,"Enjoyed a nice stay. I love the hotel location and I think has the nicest Hilton breakfast of any Hilton I’ve stayed in. Staff very friendly and a special shout out for the concierge all of whom are friendly, smiley and accommodating. The hotel is a few minutes walk from the Tate Modern which has a free viewing tower and you can walk across the Millennium Bridge to St Paul’s which also has great views from the Dome (for £18 adult entrance).",5,2018,06,17
120,Ok. ,"Well. For a 5* hotel I was expecting a bit more. The rooms are pretty old fashioned, the cleaning level could be a bit higher and the mini bar could be fuller. 
The room was freezing cold when I arrived and the check in was a bit long.

The service is excellent and the breakfast ia also very good. 

There is a nice bar in the lobby. 
",3,2018,06,15
120,Family friendly Hilton hotel !!!,"We thoroughly enjoyed our london holiday and the staff in the hotel certainly helped us to relax, they were so kind to us and our babies !!! we enjoyed the pool at the end of the day and the fabulous breakfast in the morning.
Special thanks to the concierge who was so friendly and down to earth !!!  ",5,2018,06,14
120,Great HHonors Service,"This hotel was awesome!!  Great location, OUTSTANDING service and wonderful restaurants and lounge.  There were three individuals that truly stood out during my stay.  Gregery Muller in the HHonors Lounge was on top of service going over and above.  He provided me and my co-workers with outstanding service and was extremely kind and accommodating.  Also, upon checkin, Aman & John at the front desk were a pleasure to work with and made sure I was taken great care of.  You can tell the GM of this hotel knows about customer service and teaching his team the tricks to provide the best in the industry service with a smile.  I will look forward to coming back to this hotel and thank you to Gregery, Aman & John for making my stay wonderful!!",5,2018,06,14
120,Wonderful hotel,"We had an executive room which was exceptional. We arrived before the 3pm check in and the room wasn't ready. We were shown to the executive lounge for complimentary refreshments and the receptionist bought our key within ten minutes.
The room was huge and very well appointed with everything you need for a comfortable stay. The bed was enormous and possibly the most comfortable hotel bed I have ever slept in!
The complimentary breakfast was varied and unlimited, and well received.
This was our second stay, and most certainly won't be our last. Thank you and well done to all the staff and management",5,2018,06,12
120,Fantastic Hotel and Staff,"We stayed at The Hilton London Bankside for two weeks, fabulous hotel, extremely friendly and helpful staff. Awesome people who looked after us really well, Josh and Anne in the bar and restaurant “The Distillery” and Andrei who was our outstanding doorman. 
Rooms were a good size, with large bathrooms and terrific beds. Highly recommend this hotel.",5,2018,06,11
120,Amazing,"Going by mt last review. What can I say, you can always rely on a Hilton hotel where ever you go. Plus this was the first night away for my mum after the horror of the H10 Adeje hotel in Tenerife. 
This was our first time at this hotel. It was a pleasure from when we arrived until we left. They were kind enough to upgrade us to a one bedroom suite - I could easily live there. The staff were so attentive and helpful especially Angelo on the front desk and the staff in the Executive lounge. 

Thank-you Hilton London Bankside for giving my mum the best time. Cannot wait to return ",5,2018,06,11
120,Modern room terrific location,"I have had the pleasure of working in London many times, but this was my first time at this property.

Rooms are up to date, clean, well appointed. 

It is well located for the Millennium Bridge and Tate Museum, I enjoyed a walk of several miles including Saint Paul's Cathedral.

I would definitely come back.  

One negative which I am sure is an oddity, there was a wedding at the hotel last evening and they permitted the DJ to completely overdue the subwoofers/bass and he was quite literally rattling the glasses in the executive lounge (and I think most of the ground floor) Nothing against weddings or parties - have a blast....but that was unnecessary.

One final note, London is a big town, think about where you are going and what you want to see and try to stay close.  Maximize foot/tube travel, minimize your need for cab/Uber transportation - for my purposes this property was in a great spot.

",4,2018,06,11
120,Birthday surprise,"My husband booked this hotel located near to where he works as part of a surprise weekend for my birthday. It did not disappoint. Located close to Tate Modern and therefore the River Thames an ideal location for accessing all areas of central London easily. We both routinely work in London but taking time to explore its delights was fab. The hotel staff were friendly, courteous and knowledgeable. The room was spacious and clean and had everything we needed. Husband enjoyed the swimimg pool. We ate and drank  in The Distellery. As a person who enjoys gin this bar does not disappoint - such a choice including a vintage collection(pricy) ......but my guess is worth saving up for as a special treat. The decor was modern but warm and inviting. They catered for families and children appeared to be really welcomed. A fab stay and already considering returning. We are members of rhe Hilton Honours programme and enjoy the additional pricing treats for members.",5,2018,06,10
120,Night away,"Can not fault the room, bed so comfortable, had everything in the room that you would want. 
Very clean, spacious and reasonably priced. 
Only down side was that the breakfast was on the cold side, if you order in advance you save £8 😄",5,2018,06,10
120,Birthday Perfection,"I have been lucky enough to stay at Bankside on and off over the last couple of years, but always for business. This weekend I came back, and brought my parents, for a weekend of birthday celebrations for myself and my father. I have been so impressed with the deeply personal service we have received that it has inspired me back to write another review. Jan Patterwan, one of the excellent guest relations managers, a d Max, one of the reception team leaders, have looked after us and helped with all the arrangements, including sorting everything out for a special bottle of bubbles in the room at the drop of a hat, and making sure both my parents and I had the best possible rooms and everything we needed.

The hotel itself remains a breath of fresh air in the Hilton portfolio, with a beautiful and modern design, hinting on the industrial past of the area, whilst reflecting its modern vibrancy. There is attention to detail and generosity in everthing here, from the complimentary soft drinks in the minbar, to the well stocked executive lounge where we were welcomed and waited on hand and foot whilst we waited for our rooms to be ready (we were well in advance of the 3pm check in time, but Max was not phased!)

There is of course a small gym and 20ish metre pool, more than enough for a quick morning workout or a mid afternoon break from the heat of London. Giacomo in the bar is an innovative crafter of fine drinks with world class knowledge, and his nod to world gin day was a fine way to settle our dinner.

I've seen a new side to a hotel I have become habituated to nipping in and out of, and am pleased to be able to recommend it for special occasions just as much as for a quick business trip. ",5,2018,06,09
120,"GREAT PLACE TO STAY, CLOSE TO EVERYTHING",We found this hotel and chose it because it looks new.  The reviews told us they were better than Waldorf (THEY WERE RIGHT!).  We bought a room with the executive lounge included.  This was great-they serve breakfast daily and always have drinks and snacks ready.  We stocked up on water here before heading to sightsee.  They also do drinks in the evening but we passed on those.  The hotel was very quiet and it's situated about two blocks from the underground.  It's also walking distance to a museum and places to eat.  The staff was very attentive and made sure to check in with us daily.  We would stay here again! Also they have a spa downstairs and i would recommend highly after a day of walking.,5,2018,06,05
120,Couples Weekend Break,"fantastic hotel, great staff, rooms very spacious and comfortable, beds wear a dream to sleep in and the shower was amazing, we were in room 214 king room, great location, would highly recommend for a London city Visit",5,2018,06,05
120,30th bday,"Stayed here for 2 nights this weekend with my hubby to celebrate by 30th birthday. Was excellent the room was great really comfy and cosy. Really nice touch that they put birthday cake in the room. Really friendly & polite staff. Pool was lovely especially after a long day sight seeing! 
Breakfast was delicious and great variety. Would deffo reccomend and stay again!",5,2018,06,04
120,Great hotel & great staff,"We stayed for 2 nights and had a great time at this hotel. The staff were really friendly and our room was very roomy with a hallway and separate desk area behind the bed. The bathroom was huge with both a bath & walk in shower.
 
The location is really convenient between Waterloo and London Bridge only a 5 minute walk to Southwark tube.

The executive lounge was cool with free food & drink although alcohol is only available at certain times.

The bar area is very spacious and well worth a visit, breakfast is quite expensive at £28 so have a look at other nearby options. There is a pool & Jacuzzi area which was also nice to use.

Overall a great stay and we'd certainly return again.",5,2018,06,03
120,Impressive Staff/Gin Bar/Hotel,"It was the best decision to stay at the Hilton Bankside. The staff was extremely attentively and I’ve never experienced this kind of service before. A special thanks to the waitress Maria who is working at the Gin Bar. She was very kind and attentive besides that she recommended me a very nice Italian Gin. I recommend everyone who plans to visit London , to stay at the Hilton London Bankside. It’s centrally located and is near all the attractions. 
I’m looking forward to come back.",5,2018,06,03
120,Wow!,"We have just spent a night at this fantastic hotel to celebrate a birthday. We are Gold members and were upgraded to a suite and were pleasantly surprised to get a birthday gift from the management. This hotel is in a great area of London close to the Southbank with many options for eating and drinking.  The hotel itself is fairly new and has an industrial theme to it, our suite on the 6th floor was spacious and had a super comfy bed.  The bathroom was large had a bath and a separate walk-in shower.  The overall cleanliness and housekeeping was at a very high standard which made us feel very comfortable. Even though we stayed in a Saturday night we found the hotel to be quiet and both slept very well. We were impressed with every member of staff we encountered who were super polite, smiley and friendly (well done to the management). Hilton Bankside will be our go to hotel next time we are in London!",5,2018,06,03
120,A real pleasure,"We loved this hotel! The room was spacious with lovely modern interior. I loved the grey walls & light oak wooden doors & panelling. Fabulous bathroom with a huge shower - spotlessly clean and looked after twice a day. We even got a change of towel between afternoon & evening. Again, loved the decor with slate flooring.
Our room on the third floor was quiet - heard very little noise. No view at all - only a wall but this meant complete privacy.
We didn’t use the restaurant or bar but liked the idea of a barbecue being cooked outside the bar - a nice touch for the summer.
Location was great - minutes from the South Bank & with lots of little cafes/restaurants nearby. We also made use of the Tesco & Sainsbury’s express stores on the same road.
We would definitely return here & would strongly recommend.",5,2018,06,03
120,Beautiful and friendly,"What a wonderful experience we had staying at the Hilton London Bankside! I swam in the pristine pool every morning and slept well in the comfortable bed with soft sheets and pillows. The hotel is ideally located and very attractive. The bar and restaurant were excellent and popular with not just hotel guests but locals as well.
Best of all was our experience with the staff. All so pleasant and well-trained. A lovely stay in every way!",5,2018,06,03
120,London Calling,"Needed a hotel in London (...after 5 days in Paris, on our return to the U.S.) and picked this Hilton based on its good reviews. While our Paris room was expectedly small, the Hilton Bankside was surprisingly spacious, very clean, new, modern, quiet, and had a (relatively) spacious bathroom and shower. Our check-in with Luisa was friendly and efficient, and she called our room once we got there to see if everything was to our satisfaction. Less than a 10 minute (roller bag) walk from the Southwark Underground station. About a 5 minute walk to Tate Modern Museum (free admission), Thameslink trainstation, or the Thames Riverwalk. Plenty of convenience marts, ATMs, coffee shops and lunch/dinner restaurants in the immediate vicinity. Great base for exploring London; we’d definitely stay here again.",5,2018,06,02
120,Brilliant,"Just returned from a one night stay at this lovely hotel. From the covered canopy for cabs to drop you, the friendly efficient staff throughout, the large spacious comfortable quiet rooms, well appointed shower room, excellent restaurant for dinner and breakfast and a gorgeous pool, everything was perfect. Plus it’s a five minute walk from Southwark Tube and five minutes walk to catch one of the boats on the Thames.",5,2018,06,01
120,Brilliant Hotel,"This is a fantastic hotel. Modern, stylish & luxurious. The rooms are high end, very comfortable nights stay.
Professional & polite staff, great service. 
Wonderful smell on arrival in reception & throughout. 

The bar is lovely, fab G&T’s. Can’t wait to return one day to try out the restaurant that looked buzzing & the spa.",5,2018,05,31
120,Amazing Pool and A/C,"This hotel lives up to it’s excellent reviews. It is in a great location on the south Bank of the Thames right across the street from the Tate Modern. It is a 5 minute walk to the Southwark underground stop on the Jubilee line.
The hotel has a nice small gym. It has an amazing large lap pool which was my favorite feature. If you like to swim daily for exercise this is your go to in London for the price.
My wife and I found London to be very humid and good a/c was hard to find except here. Rooms are large and very comfortable with equally large baths all hard to find at this price point. We prepaid during the annual Hilton winter sale and saved about 40%. Most hotels with these amenities in London cost a lot more.
Food was excellent in the hotel with excellent breakfast buffet and made to order food. There were many choices for food and it was all good.

Much thanks for the excellent service to Guest Service manager Rachel who resolved all our issues. We thoroughly enjoyed our 2 stays here during our trip to the UK. The hotel stored our luggage during our trip outside London.",5,2018,05,31
120,5 star service!,"My husband and I spent 3 nights here to celebrate my 40th Birthday and we definitely made the right choice. 5 mins walk (maximum) to Southwark tube. Just a stone's throw from Southbank and easy walking distance to lots of attractions. There are lots of different bars and restaurants close to the hotel so you don't have to go far in the evening if you want a stroll out.
The hotel it's self is first class. All the staff are so friendly and professional, it is obvious that they are proud to wear their uniform (and very nice it is too!). It is definately worth going for an upgrade to get access to the exceptional Executive Lounge. The Lounge is far superior to other Hilton's we have stayed at, especially the hot breakfast buffet and range of drinks available in the evening. The hotel bar serves the most wonderful cocktails, although on the pricey side they are worth the money to start your evening off or to have a night cap. The Bar Manager was really knowledgeable about his product range. We had a massage in the spa on Sunday Morning and that was also very good. The Pool is lovely, especially if you get it to yourself! House keeping went the extra mile, keeping the room refreshed and turning down the bed in the evening. We would definitely use the Hilton Bankside again. Thank you for our warm welcome.",5,2018,05,29
120,Holiday,"We spent 5 nights here as the beginning of our holiday. The location was perfect for sightseeing.
We were 5 minutes walk to Southwark station, 10 minute walk to the river ferry. 
The staff were wonderful, no question was too hard. A special mention to Gergely in the Executive lounge. He was a mine of information in regards to sightseeing and transport. As well as being a lovely man to chat too 
Our only complaint would be the beds and pillows. The bed was too hard (for me) and even after an extra pillowtop was put on the bed it was still too firm. The pillows were too soft. Again after asking for firmer pillows they were still too soft. 
Overall a wonderful hotel with excellent staff.",5,2018,05,29
120,Very Modern Business Hotel with Good Location in Central London,"This very modern hotel has a good location just a short 5-10 minute walk from the Southwark underground train station.  The surrounding area has undergone extensive urban renewal with numerous renovated and new buildings, along with many hotels, bars, and restaurants.  Immediately adjacent to the hotel are 2 competing major supermarket chain store locations operating directly across the street from each other.  Both check-in and check-out was flawless by the professional and efficient staff.  I was assigned a king bedroom on the 7th floor.  The room was a very good size and clearly designed for the business traveler with a functional desk equipped with numerous electrical outlets, good lighting and an ergonomic chair. The Premium Wi-Fi (available free to Hilton Gold and Diamond members) was quite fast. The bed was very comfortable with a large selection of pillows.  The excellent climate control system was also very quiet.  My room facing the back of the hotel had no view, but was extremely quiet and the black-out curtains worked well. The bathroom was large enough with a full size shower, but no tub.  The half-door open design on the shower still left some water on the floor after a shower, but less than experienced at other hotels using half-doors.  My room facing the back of the hotel had no view, but was extremely quiet.   The staffed gym is equipped well above average for a hotel, with stationary bikes, elliptical trainers and treadmills.  There was a multi-station weight training cable machine, a complete set of dumbbells with a bench along with a barbell and basic set of weight plates.  Various fitness accessories are also provided.  A small lap pool is located next to the gym. The breakfast buffet was very good, which included a variety of typical hot and cold items along with a made to order omelet station.  I was advised at check-in while an Executive Happy Hour is offered it is only available to Hilton Honors Diamond members.  This is an excellent hotel which caters to business travelers, and while it is not cheap with rates typically starting at around US$200+/night, this is actually reasonable for London hotels close to the center of the city at this quality level.",5,2018,05,28
120,"Fantastic property and location, attention to detail and terrific staff!","My wife and I recently stayed at the Hilton Bankside Hotel on our vacation to London and could not have been happier with the experience.  Booking early and pre-paying secured our room of choice at a great rate.  Leading up to the stay, Luisa (Shift Leader) was so responsive and provided all of the information we needed to make sure our check-in experience went smoothly upon arrival (long overnight flight from the USA).
The location, as mentioned in other reviews, provides easy access to grocery, coffee, food and transportation.  
Also notable is what appears to be a successful effort at sound-proofing the hotel.  Once inside your room, very little sound from other rooms or the hallway makes its way to your ears...good sleep after long days of sightseeing is a welcome feature!
The staff at this property obviously takes pride in their hotel and makes each guest feel warmly welcomed.  Subtle touches like luggage delivery to the room, calling the elevator in advance of walking up to the banks and an almost clinical approach to keeping the lobby immaculate (I witnessed a staff member wet mopping the floor and repeatedly kneeling down to see which sections of the floor required more attention), made staying here a joy.
Will absolutely stay at this property again in the future.  Good to know that the Hilton London Bankside can be considered a home away from home while visiting London.",5,2018,05,28
120,Clean and great location,"I stayed at the Hilton Bankside while I was in London for a week, and I am happy to report that this hotel is as excellent as advertised. There's no way to prove that I'm not a robot or being paid for this review, but trust me when I say this hotel will meet your standards and is quite a deal.  The room was clean, the beds were decent, and the shower was actually nice and powerful which was a relief after long days of sightseeing.  There's a Tesco Express and a Sainsbury's less than ten steps from the hotel, and they're open until 10PM.  The nearest tube stop is Southwark, and while it is a good 15 minute walk from the door, the walk was bright and well lit and we (two American ladies) didn't feel remotely unsafe walking to the train after dark.  Tate Modern, Starbucks, the Globe, and the bridge are less than a five minute walk, and buses around London are nearby.  Great hotel.",4,2018,05,27
120,Wonderful hotel fantastic staff & food,My husband booked The Hilton Bankside as a birthday present and tickets to Tina Turner the musical. We arrived just after midday and to our delight were able to check in and have a much needed shower - monsoon shower is fantastic. Large room with everything you need iron & board toiletries and hairdryer tea and coffee and shortbread. The staff were amazing we loved our stay and the location and will definitely return very soon!,5,2018,05,27
120,Perfect location,"Really couldn’t fault this hotel, great location - Easy to get everywhere we needed to with a nice walk along the embankment.
Clean room with every comfortable bed after a long day!
Very friendly and helpful staff and a fantastic breakfast to finish off our stay!",5,2018,05,27
120,Lovely hotel with a great cocktail bar,"Great service, nice rooms, convenient for local restaurants and convenience stores.  Cocktail bar is excellent and the staff are exceptionally helpful.  It is a short walk to the nearest tube and close to the Young Vic and Old Vic if you are going to the theatre.  Lots of restaurants in The Cut.  Very fresh feel to the hotel and the foyer is always nicely decorated with fresh flowers.",5,2018,05,26
120,Great stay at Hilton Bankside,"I was at the Hilton Bankside for 4 nights and loved it. I arrived early from a flight from Australia and while my room wasn’t ready, they led me to the shower and bathrooms connected to the pool which had everything I needed. I received a text 2 hours later letting me know my room was ready. The room itself was lovely and modern and the best part was the room was silent. The windows were sound proofed so for a light sleeper like me, it was a dream come true. Plus the rooms could be heated or cooled to your liking (unlike some hotels which set the temperature overnight) and the curtains blacked out the light. The staff were amazing without having to try hard or be excessive. The breakfast room service was great and drinks from the mini bar were included.
I didn’t use near by amenities as I was working however I would stay there for leisure in a heart beat. I’ll be there the next time I’m in London!",5,2018,05,24
120,Very chic and modern hotel in the City Centre,"We stayed for 4 nights and had a great time thanks to the superb staff at this great location! All hotel employees were super-friendly and extremely helpful, no matter whether our concern was booking a tour or having our breakfast eggs being prepared in our favourite way. 

Our room was spacious and modern with a huge bathroom and a very comfy king-sized bed. A bigger mirror in the living area to check your outfit would have been nice and it was not possible to blow-dry my hair in the bathroom in front of the mirror due to „security reasons“/no plug in the bathroom - but these were the only tiny downsides and easy to cope with.

The hotel is located perfectly and very close to two express supermarkets, the tube station, rental bikes and Tate Modern as well as River Thames and many further London attractions.

In a nutshell: do book, you will not be disappointed, and make sure you also get the lounge access!
",5,2018,05,23
120,"Great location, new and modern hotel!","Stayed here for my first London trip and this hotel was beautiful. Its a newer Hilton London hotel in the Bankside area of London. Decent location about a 8 minute walk from the tube station and have great restaurants nearby. 

Very walkable to most tourist destinations, close to Millenium Bridge and Tate Modern. Check in was very pleasant and efficient. Hotel has a beautiful lobby and the staff were friendly.

Rooms were spacious for London standard and very very MODERN which is what I like. The bathroom was very modern as well. Beds we VERY comfy! Best part of the hotel which I was shocked no one was using is the underground floor pool and hot tub. It was a beautiful heated pool with a jacuzzi and full bathroom with individual rainforest showers. I was shocked I was the only one there both times I went!

The Sunday Roast at the restaurant at the hotel was fantastic!!!!! Also the bar served over 100 different Gins I believe and had a great happy hour everyday 5-7 I believe. It was buy on get one free cocktail and the cocktails were super delicious!!!

I would definitely come back and stay at this hotel next time i'm in London!",5,2018,05,21
120,Great Location,"I have stayed at many properties in London but chose this one for location. 5 Minute walk to Blackfriars Rail and Southwark Underground.  From here its 15 minute walk to Big Ben and Tower of London in the other direction. The room was very good and staff were great, we arrived very late and the staff recommended some great quick bites near by. Executive lounge was nice and had  a good selection. Breakfast was very comprehensive and had a great selection compared to most full service Hilton's.",5,2018,05,21
120,Nice Modern Hotel Right Behind Tate Modern,The hotel was well maintained and looked really new. The check in staff and concierge were friendly and helpful. The deluxe room was nice in size and nicely decorated. The bathroom was very beautifully done up and spacious. It's a 5 minute walk to the underground station. The convenience stores just next to the hotel made it convenient to stock up. Overall a nice pleasant experience!,4,2018,05,21
120,"Excellent Hotel, Good Location","Our best overall hotel experience in Europe. The staff, from the front desk and concierge, to the restaurant, to the room maintenance, were welcoming, courteous, helpful, and competent. Our standard King room was clean, large comfy bed, 2 closets, bathroom with large sink, and shower with both rain and hand shower heads. The heat/air conditioning was quiet and efficient, and the room itself was well insulated from any external noise (of which there seemed to be none). The breakfast buffet, which was included in our room package, was one of the best we have had.  Lots of variety and choice, fruit juices (especially the dark carrot and pomegranate blend), milks, coffees, teas, breads, pastries, hot and cold cereals with toppings, yogurts, chefs standing by for your egg and omelette orders, fruit salads, and more. The location is a few minutes walk to the south bank Jubilee Walkway and the Thames river, and a few minutes more to St. Paul's Cathedral. The Southwark tube station is a 5-8 minute walk, and you are connected to the rest of London. We thoroughly enjoyed our stay.",5,2018,05,21
120,Great location to stay and fabulous wedding venue,"Stayed here for 2 nights and the location is excellent for the Tate Modern, St Paul’s, Borough Market, the Thames etc but we also attended a wedding here on our second day and the venue was excellent. Capacity for 500 guests and a beautiful wedding venue. There is a bar in the hotel that was great, and also a restaurant where we ate breakfast. (Breakfast was included in our tariff which was good, but like many hotels it lacked staff to get a spare knife or coffee etc. but otherwise good). Would recommend this for a great place to stay in London and also for any large capacity wedding venue.",5,2018,05,21
120,One night stay but very happy ,"We stayed here for only one night but were very pleased with our decision to stay here. Staff are very friendly, the lobby has a great welcoming atmosphere and is clean, modern and bright. Rooms are large and beds very comfortable. Bathrooms well
stocked with all necessities and are large and modern. Hotel is short 5 minute walk to Southwark tube station (jubilee line) and easily accessible via car or public transport. Downside is valet is £40 per day and there is limited parking. Aside from this, you can reach most of the attractions by foot or through public transport. Located in a quiet area in London which is  safe. Although this hotel is not in the heart of London we would stay here again. ",5,2018,05,20
120,Disappointed ,"We had a 3 night stay here and was very disappointed. When we arrived we went to check in and was asked to provide another £150 as a holding fee which I found very insulting considering I have stayed in much nicer and more expensive hotels and not had to pay this. £150 is a lot of money if you haven’t got it in your account! Luckily we do but for people not expecting it might have taken the shine of the weekend as you do not have access to the £150 until you check out. We tried to order room service on the first evening and ending up calling reception as the room service number was just calling out. Having said that when the food came it was very nice although very expensive for what we received my partner then tried to make himself a coffee however there was no coffee so we had to call down again and have some brought up. The bed was large and extremely comfy and the room was quite quiet for the first floor which was good as it enabled a good nights sleep. The tea/coffee facilities was not well stocked and I had to call down asking for more English breakfast tea as by day 3 I had used the 2 tea bags provided! On the morning of leaving I was sent an invoice including our room service which was £0 as it said they had deducted this from the card I had left however on check out I was asked to pay for the room service, I had to show the receptionist my email to evidence it had already been taken. All in all I was not impressed. Comfy bed and quiet room are the only good things I can say about the hotel. We certainly didn’t get value for money. Finally the pool is ok although the temperature was cooler than I usually like although I wouldn’t mark the hotel down on this. ",3,2018,05,20
120,A perfect stay ,"My husband and I stayed here overnight. The service is exceptional and staff are very friendly and accommodating. We had dinner and breakfast at the restaurant. We enjoyed both. Our room suited our needs perfectly. Special mention and thanks to Dylan who served our breakfast and went out of his way to provide us with a map and information for the places we wanted to see. Extra special mention and thanks to Andrei who went out of his way to find us a driver/taxi to show us the sights before taking us to Gatwick for our flight. 
Many thanks to all staff. We highly recommend this hotel. 
",5,2018,05,20
120,Marvelous! ,"When you leave your home because you have to travel, you expect to stay in place that is at least as good as your home. 
That’s how I felt about the Hilton London Bankside.
The service was impeccable, the room was perfect, the breakfast was delicious and the wifi did work.
Would definitely come back!",5,2018,05,17
120,Bankside 5 star teeatment,"The hotel is amazing, best hotel I’ve stayed in in London. The rooms are very modern, and the hotel has a very cool, chilled atmosphere. The exec lounge if you’re Diamond is very cool and the food and drink is pretty fancy. The breakfast is AMAZING. I’ve never seen a selection like it and it is delicious. I’d stay there for the breakfast alone. Love everything about this place",5,2018,05,17
120,Great location and a generous happy hour,"We just finished an around the world cruise and the Hilton Bankside was a nice finish to the trip.  Very attentive staff, comfortable rooms and a great location near the Thames.  The Tate Modern is within minutes for art lovers.",5,2018,05,16
120,Bankside. Another Side of London.,"The hotel is in a great location for exploring along the Thames and the Tate Modern.
As a Hilton Honors Diamond member I was upgraded to a beautiful suite which was stylishly and comfortably furnished.
All members of staff we met, from front of house to waitstaff in the restaurant and lounge to housekeeping were exemplary, being both friendly and efficient.
Afternoon tea and evening drinks and canapes in the Executive Club Lounge were generous and of a high standard. In fact, this was the best overall Club Lounge experience of our entire trip throughout the UK.
Pre- stay emails were answered promptly and all requests granted. Great value for money.",5,2018,05,15
120,Didn't meet the expectations,"After reading the reviews I really wanted to like this hotel and at the first look it was great indeed. The decor in the hotel is superb and the warm scent in the lobby really makes you feel welcome.

However, our problems started right when we entered our room. Both the premium wi-fi (free for HHonor members) and the free wi-fi were down and did not work properly in the first 24 hours.

As we arrived quite late we were hoping to get something from the room service but the in-room telephone was broken. After a visit to the reception we found out that a fix could take up to 20 minutes. Since we were tired we asked if we could get do this the following day as we just wanted to eat and sleep. Our request was noted but unfortunately we were still woken up at 8:30am by someone rushing into our room (not sure if the housekeeping or the repairman for the telephone).

In addition to this the toilet flush didn't work as it should but we were too tired to complain anymore and take the risk that someone would actually come and fix it in an unsuitable time. We were bothered so many times that it just got ridiculous and we didn't even spend that much of time in the room. If you visit this hotel and wish to sleep or relax in your room make sure to always put the ""do not disturb"" sign out as the housekeeping is very eager to get inside twice a day and will not hear any no-thank you's you scream.

Breakfast was really good but the service varied. Sometimes you'd be asked if you'd like a coffee, sometimes not. Sometimes your table would be cleaned completely if you just went to get something more to drink. The breakfast chef was really great though and you could order pancakes or eggs they way you wanted them. However, the room service (at least the Night Menu) was a disappointment. The chips were extremely dry and barely eatable.

Overall the stay wasn't that terrible but all of these little things combined left us unimpressed and feeling like the usual Hilton standards were not met.",3,2018,05,15
120,"8 nights- 2 different rooms, good but not great","Gold Hilton honor member- given a room on top floor-room 716. First impression- BAD. We were still recovering from jet lag- wanted to nap upon check in after shower. Surprised to see make-up stain on the duvet cover after we flipped it open. Informed front desk- sent house housekeeping promptly to change the cover. 

Second issue: 716 is located on the corner, quiet room with small narrow window. The shower area made it impossible to enjoy our stay. After the 4th night, we asked for a change of room- to have bathtub or anything else but not those that come in deluxe room( just as 716). The shower area always overflow because it has a very shallow floor and about half foot above the bathroom floor! How weird! When I asked to change the room, I was told the management aware of this problem and working to fix the situation. Everytime after shower ( regardless how careful or short time), we ended up using all our towels to wipe the bathroom floor. Very frustrating. 

New assigned room is 100% better. Room 421. No issues there. Deep bathtub- shower in tub. 

We are very disappointed with no coffee maker in the room. We stayed in six Hilton and Doubletree hotels in London for 3 weeks. All came with Nespresso machine except this hotel. I was informed by front desk that only for specific rooms will have coffee maker.

We chose this hotel for the longest stay( 8 nights) due to reviews we read here. Wouldn’t have done that next time.

Breakfast buffet had great varieties but limited for vegetarian. The breakfast chef, Ali is very kind and friendly. He even made us vegetarian sausages. The pastries here left little to be desired. Somehow every morning, regardless the time we went down for breakfast, the pastries tasted hard or stale. We had eaten similar breakfast since all our stays in Hilton properties. Most tasted as fresh baked as they should be! By the 6th day/morning, I voiced out to the restaurant team. The pastries chef came out to talk on the 7th morning, and even offered some mini cakes to us. The cakes were delicious. I couldn’t say the same for pastries on the 8th morning. I appreciated the effort and presentation of the pastries( tempted me each morning !) but by the 8th morning, I realized I better save my intake calories for something else.

Location of this hotel is great, right opposite Tate Modern( across the road)  and near Borough Market. We were offered celebration cakes and wine multiple times throughout our stay, thank you. No note accompanied those treats, made it almost awkward for me to call and enquire at front desk. Still, appreciate the gesture.

Front desk staffs were professional but a little cold. Doormen were always friendly and smiling. One breakfast buffet service staff, Dylan Hieu captured our attention for our last couple of days. Always smiling and eager to help, efficient and approachable. To every table. Amazing personality! If everyone in this Hilton has half of what he offers, I think this can be a great hotel. Otherwise, I prefer Hilton London Bridge a lot more.",3,2018,05,14
120,Birthday Weekend,"Just had a wonderful weekend celebrating my wife’s birthday at the Hilton Bankside. The service is second to none which began from my initial emails and continued all the way to checking out.
The rooms are beautifully designed and possibly the most comfiest bed I’ve ever slept in. The shower is a sight to behold.
Breakfast was plentiful and of high quality, all in stunning surroundings. The hotel is in a perfect position on the Southbank and an ideal base. A wonderful hotel and wonderful staff made this a perfect weekend. We will be back.",5,2018,05,14
120,Above and beyond service!!,I had a wonderful experience here. I was supposed to stay one night on business but it turned into 2 nights when my flight was cancelled.  Mark the Concierge went above and beyond to help me try to get through to the airline to rebook my flight.  He was compassionate and showed me a great deal of kindness. He also offered some great suggestions on how to spend my unexpected day in London!  There was also another women who was extremely helpful but I didn’t get her name.  I had an excellent service experience which was very much appreciated!,5,2018,05,14
120,"Location, efficiency and great food",Stayed a couple nights on recent business trip.  Short walk to the Thames and Covent Garden.  Rooms were very well equipped for the modern traveller.  The attached restaurant was surprisingly good for dinner and breakfast was simply fantastic.,5,2018,05,13
120,Great Location ,"Stayed one night , as gold members we were upgraded to an executive room.
All the staff were friendly and helpful. 
Executive lounge was nice but we had a lovely breakfast in the restaurant, lots of choice and the chefs were happy to make whatever you wanted. My daughter is coeliac and they were happy to separately toast her GF bread . 
The pool was lovely .
Nice clean , new hotel in a great area . ",5,2018,05,13
120,Fantastic Stay,"Stayed in quite a few Hilton Hotels in London; the Bankside Hitel is by far the BEST we have stayed in. As a Hilton Honours member ( there are different levels); you are entitled to number of benefits ( check it out - on line book in, selection of room, in room extras etc). This hotel is modern, spacious. In the basement there is a gym and swimming pool. Large public spaces; a gin bar; the breakfast room is spacious, tables are well spaced out. The choice and quality of food is astonishing, regularly replenished: cereals, fruit juices;  full English breakfast; omelette cooked to your request; eggs Benedict, scrambled  etc. Pastries, of all sorts, teas ( speciality ones) coffees etc. The quality of the food, the surroundings are excellent. Makes a great start to the day. To conclude, the final comment must focus on the hotel staff. Every member of staff is welcoming, very pleasant and go out of their way to make you feel special. Natasha who dealt with us on reception was superb: welcoming, efficient, and had time for us - an excellent first impression of the hotel. But - ALL the staff are caring, efficient and go out of their way to make your stay the very best it can be. We have decided that in the future there is no decision to be made - when we are planning another visit to London, our first task ( before anything else) will be to secure our accommodation at the Hilton Bankside. We cannot praise this hotel and its staff enough. We look forward to our next visit !!",5,2018,05,13
120,Superb hotel,"We loved this hotel, by far one of the best we have ever stayed in. We arrived early but were still given a room very quickly. The room was spacious and comfortable with everything you’d need. The bed was huge with luxurious bedding. The bathroom was modern, lovely shower and spotlessly clean. Every member of staff we spoke to were friendly, polite and professional, nothing was too much trouble. The restaurant is fabulous. Breakfast is amazing, so much choice, and the chef made me a delicious omelette in just a few minutes. The evening menu is superb, fantastic tasting food using the best ingredients. We ate at The Shard one night, for twice the price, and I’d say the Bankside’s food was better. Can’t wait to stay here again. ",5,2018,05,12
120,Great hotel!,"The location is fantastic and the staff is so friendly and welcoming. Our room was very comfortable and quiet, which is very important for us. The light switches were a little confusing to work but other than that I would highly recommend staying here ",5,2018,05,11
120,Solid Hilton property offering the business traveler all one could need,"Spent 2 nights here while attending a conference within walking distance of the hotel.

Good location for businesses or venues located in that part of London.

Room was spacious, well-appointed and modern.  I particularly enjoyed the Executive Club, great breakfast buffet and grill options, as well as the health & wellness area.

There are plenty of restaurants and mini-supermarkets right around the hotel, so plenty of options to self-cater if so desired.

Bottom-line, a good all-round hotel carrying-on the Hilton quality consistency one expects of a well-run property, and exactly what I needed during this particular visit to London.",4,2018,05,11
120,"Great hotel, great staff in a well communicated and off the beaten path London location. ","This is a really good modern hotel with great amenities and in a very good location with fantastic staff.

- Room - very comfortable, great beds, with everything you need. Beautiful bathroom. Very clean.
Our room didn’t have a great view - we were looking at a wall. I would have liked to be given a choice of a better view, but that is the only thing that could have been improved of our stay, everything else was perfect.

I would definitely stay there again!

120,Great locations and friendly staffs. ,"Only stay for 1 night for Saturday leisure. Great location close by all major attractions, the Shard, Borough Market, Tate modern or Shakespeare's. Indoor swimming pool is great especially in London area hotels! Only wish their jacuzzi is separated from the pool with hot water. The turn around service was  attention to details! ",5,2018,05,10
120,Hilton at its best.,"Travelled  into London, accompanying my wife to a trade event. The Bankside Hilton was the event venue and we were pleased to be staying  so close. Check-in  and reception was flawless, if a wee bit over-exuberant, we received an upgrade that included a small suite, executive lounge etc. Gold status pays. 
 The suite was lovely, very well appointed and spotless. The view wasn't  too flash but we weren't  on holiday. As usual, the executive lounge was very nice with all the usual stuff, formal afternoon tea, pre-dinner  drinks and canape and a decent breakfast selection.
The hotel location is excellent, just behind the Tate Modern and across the Thames  from St Paul's, ideal for a bit of touristing, Southwark  tube station is around the corner and Waterloo about 10mins walk away.
Negatives, well one or two. First, the gym, too small, needs a bit more equipment (nothing to do legs on, come on!)the pool looked great and there is a wee spa too. Secondly, the executive lounge is cleared of all food, drink and snacks far too early. It is still possible to get coffee and some cold drinks, but everything else is removed to prepare for breakfast. Sometimes a person would like a snack to go with their evening coffee.
All in all an excellent experience, a couple of minor gripes shouldn't  put anyone off, this is a very good hotel for both London bound tourists and business people.",5,2018,05,09
120,Awesome hotel (and Dylan),"Had a great stay last week at the Hilton bankside. Service, rooms and breakfast were all fantastic. However, I must give a special mention to Dylan at breakfast. His service was phenomenal. He went the extra mile for everyone around him and should be the gold standard for all Hilton hotels! Hopefully he will receive some sort of recognition for this as he deserves it. ",5,2018,05,09
120,Unbeatable Stay,"Spent a long weekend here over Bank Holiday and everything was OUTSTANDING. The room, bed, executive lounge and restaurant are first class and the best thing is the staff. We walked everywhere from the hotel to see the sites of London as the location was very central. Hard to beat and we will be returning soon - Thanks Hilton Bankside for this experience.",5,2018,05,08
120,Very nice service,"I stayed at the Hilton Bankside a few weeks ago and just want to mention the very friendly and helpful staff member at breakfast Dylan Hiele, he went out of his way to pack up the food we had ordered as I was in a bit of a hurry to check out.  This hotel is in a great location, clean and very helpful staff.",4,2018,05,08
120,An unexpected positive buzz.,"Location
This is not my most favoured location in London, but it has lots to offer. The area has a buzz to it, and there are many places to eat within 20 minutes of walking, including some well-known restaurants. The hotel is a 10 minute walk from Southwark Underground Station and a similar walk to the Thames. The Tate Modern, Borough Market, The Shard, Globe Theatre, London Eye and St Paul’s Cathedral are all within easy walking distance.

Check-in and out
Efficient and friendly. No issues at all. 

Public rooms
Chic, comfort and a great ambience. It certainly appeals to a young business crowd and I didn’t feel out of place. I didn’t dine in Oxbo, but I had drinks and lunch at The Distillery – the staff, food and drinks were notably good. The place has a great vibe.

Leisure facilities
Pools in central London hotels are few and far between. I was fortunate enough to spend an hour in this one, mid-afternoon, and I had it all to myself. It was certainly one of my better inner city pool experiences. The only slight negatives would be that the whirlpool is joined to the main pool (shares the water) and thus the temperature of the water isn’t high enough in the whirlpool, and there is no steam room or sauna.

Breakfast
Oxbo has a large seating area, which means that it doesn’t feel crowded. Staff were on the ball and service orientated. The cold and hot buffet contains a wide-range of foods to suit all tastes. My only gripe would be the quality of the coffee that I was served. The cappuccino that I subsequently requested was fine.

Room
I was impressed with my twin deluxe room. This room had great design, everything was in the right place and it was spotlessly clean.
Pros: Good quality bedding; modern, chic furniture; excellent lighting; a safe; plenty of wardrobe space; high quality bathroom fittings and tiling, and a superb shower.
Cons: None apparent.

Staff
Every member of staff that I came across was friendly and efficient. They have been trained to have an interest in their guests and it is obvious that they are doing a lot more than just going through the motions. Anna on the front desk and Alex in the bar deserve a mention (both Romanian).

To sum up, this is a hotel I would definitely return to. Staying here gave me a positive buzz. It was a combination of great, modern decor and a friendly, service orientated staff.",5,2018,05,05
120,Hard to believe it keeps getting better - outstanding ,"Just returned to Los Angeles having spent 15 nights at the Hilton London Bankside - and it was outstanding! If I could, I would have awarded the hotel 6 stars based on the combination of the standard of the accommodation and the staff. This was my fourth stay at this hotel and from the moment I arrived to the moment I left, I felt special - which I confess I appreciate, especially having just flown half way around the world to get there. 

John and Mark who provide the concierge service go out of there way to help you any way they can and are full of suggestions, some of which you may not of thought of. Anneke who leads the reception team makes sure your room is fully supplied with everything you need, and should you need anything else, magically makes it appear in no time at all. 

Anna-Luise Zschau in the OXBO restaurant not only remembers where you prefer to sit but also the things you like to eat and drink. 

For those who have access to the executive lounge are in for a treat. The team are there to help you relax and go out of their way at any time of day, to serve you. Gegelli is a superstar, anticipating what you would like, when you would like to have it - and it’s there!

The list goes on and wish I could mention everyone there but have to mention two more. Stijn Huijbers and Jerome Zentveld who are the corporate business development managers at the hotel are superb. Stijn created a corporate account for my company and if you work for a company and could be regular guests at this hotel, I recommend you talk to these gentlemen. They go the extra mile to provide a very competitive rate and service. Stijn also checks in with me while I am at the hotel to see if there is anything else that can do to make my stay more enjoyable. 

I have already booked my next stay at this hotel and look forward to seeing everyone there. ",5,2018,05,03
120,Worth every cent,"Many places may exceed your expectations, but it is easy to simply offer lots of amenities, high level service paying also a lot for it. What you may find here is all of that for a reasonable price, and this is what makes this Hilton property simply wonderful. Of course, the tube station is not really that close to the hotel but it's nothing so bad considering the other good points they offer. Location is still good, just close to the Tate Modern, not far from Borough Market.
Rooms are quiet, well planned and comfortable enough for a wonderful rest after going through the city. There is a nice swimming pool in the basement which may extend your wellness session. We have stayed in an Executive room, this type of room gives you access to the Executive Lounge where you can enjoy drinks and snacks, have a good chat in a nice place and also have your breakfast in a more intimate place if you don't want or don't like the large restaurant where they serve the regular breakfast. Well, breakfast is very good, English and continental options.
Highly recommended!!! ",5,2018,04,30
120,Hilton Bankside sets the standard for how Hilton hotels in the United States should be like,"My family and I had a wonderful stay at Hilton Bankside.  We were upgraded when we checked in (Diamond).  The room was impeccable.  The lounge serves really good afternoon tea and food, although we didn't really spend a lot of time in there. Breakfast was better than most of the Hilton hotels I have been to in the US.  The only minor complaint I have for the hotel is that their whirlpool is connected to the swimming pool, therefore it's cold water, which I find odd.  But everything else about this hotel is amazing.  I am impressed because I am comparing this hotel to my experiences with other Hilton hotels in the US, which are often disappointing.",5,2018,04,30
120,Poor accuracy,"I was not given the right room and left me with no alternatives, otherwise decent hotel but staff didn’t empathize. The location is ok as well but nothing to write home about. Would not be my first choice ",2,2018,04,29
120,Outstanding! ,"Stayed here early December (been meaning to write a review since...!) 
Picked this hotel based on the location, we were heading to see Jamiroquai at The O2 for the evening so perfect for the Jubilee line...and also from the rave reviews on here. We opted for one of the Executive Rooms and it was so worth it. 

We were not disappointed. What an outstanding hotel in every sense. The super attentive staff, the contemporary design and quirky touches, the fabulous rooms and super comfy beds, the gin bar, the selection for breakfast, the Executive Lounge....the list goes on. 

Just loved every moment of staying here and we can’t wait to return this coming weekend, for 2 nights this time. 

Our new fav hotel in London...whoever would have thought it would have been a Hilton! A credit to the brand and the Manager and staff should feel very proud of themselves and I hope they are all appreciated. 

See you Friday! 

",5,2018,04,27
120,Excellent,"Located in the trendy Southwark district, this hotel is top notch.  It’s very modern with all the perfect bits of a great hotel.  From the super helpful concierges who we bothered incessantly for information to the special touches like truffles left in our room one night and the cheese, fruit and crackers left another night, all was basically perfect.  And the location is quite convenient being just a short walk to the Tate Modern, Shakespeare’s Globe and Saint Paul’s Cathedral directly across the Thames over the Millennium Bridge.  I would definitely stay here again.",5,2018,04,27
120,Great hotel and location,"Spent a week here while working across the river.  This is a top notch hotel with great facilities and customer service.  We used the restaurant, workout room and pool, all were excellent.  The front desk and concierge were most helpful and always with a smile and hello.  Location couldn’t be better near the Tate Modern, river and Millennium bridge.  Also found the Brough Market, a farmers market on steroids, a must visit if you have time.  Will be staying here in the future.   ",5,2018,04,24
120,Good Location and Service,"The hotel is centrally located, about 7 minutes walk from the London Bridge Station, My room faced another building, hence most of the time I had my curtain closed. The room was pretty small. There was bedside socket and the bed was comfortable. There was a limitation on the number of devices that can connect to the Internet for free. The gym was small. The breakfast was of good quality and the service was good.",4,2018,04,23
120,"Amazing stay, great hotel","I stayed in a twin room for my 21st Birthday with a friend for two nights over the weekend. All of the staff were so friendly and helpful, it was nice that every staff member you walked past acknowledged you! The room was spacious and probably the cleanest I have ever visited. Lovely modern interior in the rooms and around the hotel. It was also great to have a special touch of receiving a welcome card and a dessert delivered up to the room wishing me a happy birthday! I don’t think I would even consider staying in another hotel in London after the great service I received at the Hilton Bankside! The hotel is also very close to Southwark tube station which made travelling very easy! I look forward to visiting one day again in the future!",5,2018,04,23
120,Comfortable hotel,Nice and quiet hotel near the Waterloo Underground station. Had my room facing a big brick wall but still nice and cosy. very nice breakfast room with lots of variety to choose from. lots of meeting spaces as well - to whom it may be relevant.,4,2018,04,22
120,Leaving the county.... farewell lunch ,"Our buddy is leaving the country. Bad times. It’s sad. However...... as a positive, we have loads of events ahead of us. Some family occasions, some work colleagues, some friends on a massive session. It’s sad but we will make the most of this situation! To start the took the close family friends to the Hilton on great Suffolk Street for the all you can drink prosecco brunch. I had thought it would fall short as all the “all you can eat” stuff normally does but to be fair.... we all really enjoyed it.

16 of us were here, losing a couple along the way. The food was good. Far better than expected. Unusually the bottomless prosecco really was just that. It kept flowing whenever we needed a refill. 

Kamal, the assistant manager was by far the most outstanding contribution to the lunch ensuring our every need was fulfilled.  I would come here again, in fact, I will be booking in the near future. 

Thank you kamal and your team

120,Great hotel in the heart of the city,"The best thing about this hotel is the wonderful service that the staff in every area of the hotel provide.  We have stayed here several times and will returning soon.  The welcome at check in from Eirini was warm and genuine and she made sure that our family who joined us for the weekend were allocated rooms on the same floor.  The restaurant staff at breakfast and dinner were friendly and attentive and the cleaning staff excellent.  Highly recommend this hotel, happy hour in the lovely Distillery bar is an excellent bonus!",5,2018,04,20
120,For one night only.....but what a night!,"My husband booked this hotel for my birthday. On arrival we were upgraded to the executive suite which was amazing. Lovely spacious room with the most amazing bed - the duvet & pillows, I was sure, were made of marshmallow, I just melted into it.  The bathroom had a super power shower with jets. 
We checked out the executive lounge facilities and found a fantastic selection of bagels, cakes & drinks. 
A chocolate cake had been left in our room with Happy Birthday written on it, very nice touch.
 We dined at the Oxo tower, which is about a 10 minute walk from the hotel. 
Heading back to our room after our meal, the sheets had been turned down, bottles of water & slippers by the bed, music playing some chill out tracks - as if Father Christmas himself had been - and it was snowing in London! 
Staff are extremely friendly & helpful. Breakfast catered for every possible taste.  I would love to stay here again, we were made to feel very special. ",5,2018,04,17
120,Slipping service standards in executive lounge,"Having stayed on many occasions the standard of the lounge is extremely good much down to the work of Gergely.  However, much of this was undone in the evening pre dinner drinks in the evening.  The staff were topping up the drinks etc but then disappeared for lengthy periods allowing used glasses and plates to accumulate on the tables.  There was no sign of any of the executive lounge management which probably contributed to the slipshod service.  Don’t let your service in a small area of the hotel detract from an otherwise splendid stay.",4,2018,04,17
120,Great hotel,"Very satisfied with the hotel. The only draw back was that we got a handicap room, witch we didn't need. We could have asked to change room, but arrived at midnight and was to tired. We think at least the bathroom would have been better if it was not wheelchair customized. 

The breakfast was great, the cleaning was perfect and the stab was very polite and helpful. 

We stayed for 4 nights, and might come back. Recommends the hotel to everyone.",5,2018,04,15
120,Fantastic :) It lived up to expectations ,"I thoroughly recommend this hotel. The staff were noticeably friendly which makes a real difference. The room was nicely decorated and the shower was hot and powerful. The pool was lovely and not over crowded at all. The hotel restaurant had a nice atmosphere and tasty food. In terms of room for improvement it was a few minor things that would not stop us visiting again. Our view was of another building. The light switch system was a bit odd as you couldn’t turn just one light on at a time and there was no bath. There were also no baked beans at breakfast and there was no mini bar in the room, just water and tea sachets etc With all that said we had a great stay, thank you. ",4,2018,04,15
120,Best Hilton Experience-Diamond Member  ,"Definitely the best Hilton we have stayed at, in terms of customer service from all staff. Very clean, great scent & deco. 

location is ideal for city with good access and parking.

Executive lounge is on point.  

High standards on par with Dubai & Vegas!!
",5,2018,04,12
120,Met all expectations and beyond ,"We read lots of review and because there’s so many to choose from we had a tough time finalizing in one but we decided on Hilton Bankside because of the raving reviews. We were worried we might be let down but we were not! 

We arrived early and could check in straight away which is such a plus point because we were going for a musical. The moment u enter the room it felt kinda small but once you realize the hidden cupboards and etc... it’s really quite spacious! We took the guest room which is their smallest. We thought if it’s too small we will upgrade when we are there but after we unpacked everything (one big and one small luggage) we were still happy with the space!

The king size bed is so good to just stay in and recuperate! The toilet is really quite big and modern an we loved the layout...

The heated swimming pool is so nice! Loved it! 

Service from all staffs were awesome too!

Food at OXBO is as good as all the reviews 

Yes we definitely will come back!

Ps: my son is still excited abt the fox hunt! ",5,2018,04,12
120,A lot to offer,"Was recommended to try this hotel by my son who stayed here 3 months ago. The location is good near to the Embankment, and not far from Tower Bridge, and the lovely walk from the London Eye to Tower Bridge. Very modern reception area and swift efficient check-in. Exec Lounge excellent and pleasingly furnished. My Exec Room spacious and with a super bathroom with a very efficient shower. The walls in the room mostly wooden panelled which gives a slightly gloomy experience: would have been better in a light colour. Nevertheless, room otherwise super but with limited views from the floor to ceiling windows. Food first class both for breakfast and evening meal. A feature of the hotel are the friendly staff who go that extra mile to provide polite, friendly, efficient service. This is a big plus point and refreshing to experience nowadays. Will I return? Most definitely ‘Yes’.",4,2018,04,12
120,Amazingly quiet and high quality hotel in London - breakfast is best we've had and the pool has wow factor!,"We loved our stay at the Hilton, it is extremely high quality, clean, luxurious, and very quiet.  Attention to detail is great too, with a call when we arrived in the room to check everything was okay, and then the room prepared for bedtime by staff when we were enjoying the pool.",5,2018,04,12
120,Great hotel in a great neighborhood.,"Built just a few years ago, this Hilton and its employees will welcome you with open arms. Quality from beginning to end, and I can't say enough about the breakfast. And make sure you stop in the Oxbo bar, the bartenders there are some of the greatest. Engaging and creative, maybe they will invent a drink for you.",5,2018,04,10
120,Fantastic Hotel,"What a great hotel, the staff are brilliant, nothing is too much trouble. Best service in a hotel I have had anywhere I have stayed in the world. My friend and I stayed in a twin deluxe room. Spotless, and they have thought of everything you need. This Hotel proved to be a pleasant surprise to our girlie weekend. ",5,2018,04,09
120,Just excellent in every way!,"Stayed one night whilst in London for an anniversary dinner.  We loved this Hotel - from the very friendly lady on Reception when we checked it, to the very comfortable room and fabulous shower, to the very good choice offered in the Executive Lounge - we will definitely stay here again when next in London.  One little touch which I really appreciated were the empty shelves in the bathroom where you can store your make-up and washing kit - I don't think I have ever seen this in a Hotel before and it makes such a different not to have to leave everything out on the counter top!  Yes, the valet parking is a little expensive but in my opinion it is worth it to avoid the hassle of finding parking yourself.",5,2018,04,09
120,Wonderful London Base - Alan and Barbara,"This was our third stay at Hilton London Bankside, over the last two years. The hotel is one of the best we have stayed in.The staff have always been friendly and helpful, in particular John Korteray and Mark Kis, the conceirges, who go out of their way to answer any questions or queries, even those outside their area.
The breakfasts are definitely the best and chef Ali Onally,  who has a fantastic memory for faces, together with his colleague, always have a warm smile and friendly greeting, whilst at the same time cooking amazing omelettes and egg dishes.  Ali is the face of the hotel at breakfast and does a wonderful job of ensuring everyone is happy.
The location near the Tate Modern is handy with tube stations Southwark and Waterloo five minutes away, and London Bridge and Borough Markets nearby.  Lots of new bars and eateries in surrounding streets.     We hope we are able to return soon.  Would you please pass on this message to these great face of Hilton London Bankside.",5,2018,04,08
120,Another brilliant stay!,"This time we decided to upgrade to the suite and the lounge access. I was a little cautious about this due to the added expence but it was definitely worth it. The suite is perfect! The bed is super comfortable and the bathroom beautiful. The lounge access entitles you breakfast in the morning, canopes at 3-5 and then coctails from 5.30 - 8.00 all free of charge. Its a lovely lounge to unwind in from the busy streets and the waiting staff is fantastic. Still waiting to find something wrong with this hotel and i dont think I ever will",5,2018,04,08
120,Second stay,"We received a lovely welcome at Reception as the member of staff noted that this was our second stay.  Once again, the staff who work here were exceptional and are one of the main reasons why I'd choose to return here time and again.

We only went for the 'standard' room this time, and although excellent, wasn't as good as my previous stay.  We had a view of a wall which was a little disappointing, and the bed wasn't very comfortable, but I'm going to assume this is a one off as I had a perfectly good sleep on my first visit.

It's definitely my go-to hotel for any future London stays.  You just cannot beat the service you receive here.",4,2018,04,08
120,Fantastic Hilton ,"We stayed here one night and loved it. The bed was really comfortable, my only issue was the pillows aren’t as firm as I like. The bathroom was spotless and looks like new and the shower had good water pressure. Really great decor and the lobby is beautiful. We had some drinks at the gin bar, it has a nice atmosphere but was a little expensive maybe. We didn’t try the breakfast but the hotel is in a great location for exploring the south bank. One of the nicest Hilton’s I’ve stayed at. ",5,2018,04,07
120,nice stay,"Very nice hotel, clean , quit rooms, good service, i would recomand to anyone, I was very satisfied!!
Very nice chec in and check out- friendly team.
Soon i will be back !!
One of the nicest experieces i ever had.",5,2018,04,06
120,Wonderful hotel for families who need connecting/family rooms.,"The Hilton Bankside was the perfect hotel for our family on this trip.  Our sons are 15 and 13, and the connecting/family rooms worked very well in terms of comfort, space, and privacy for everyone.  One room had a king bed with a private bath, and the kids' room had two single beds with another bath.  The hotel staff was also top notch from beginning to end.  We would highly recommend this hotel for families visiting London.",5,2018,04,06
120,Hilton Honors members-Look elsewhere in London,"This is a nice hotel from the lobby up. The rooms are new and clean. Unfortunately, having been a Hilton Honors member since 2005, and having received every advantage of being so at other hotels, all I have heard since arrival are reasons why it will do me no good here (my Gold status) and why Diamond members are so much more important than Gold and therefore come first. I have never experienced this anywhere else and I have stayed at MANY Hilton brands. I was offered an upgrade in order to enjoy my “perks”, but at a cost to me of an additional approx $300.00 per night, per room for a required upgrade (I have two rooms so about $1800.00 more for three nights!) I would suggest you try one of the other many Hilton brands while in London. I suppose if your not a Hilton Honors member, it’s a nice hotel to visit as it truly is clean and quiet and far from the beaten path of tourism. The staff, although unable to accommodate me as I normally am at other Hilton hotels have been VERY kind. ",2,2018,04,05
120,Awesome Hotel and a Great Value,"We had a lovely stay at Hilton Bankside. The location was exactly what we wanted, a quick subway stop or 20 minute walk to major tourist attractions, which we did during the day. And also surrounded by many foodie restaurants near Borough market and Bermondsey Street which we could walk to in 5-10 minutes when we were exhausted in the evening. The hotel is new and modern with most every amenity and a super nice staff. 

Our only few complaints were that the beautiful pool and spa lacked a steam or sauna despite having the space for it and that the “hot tub” was actually just a bunch of jets at the same temperature as the pool. Although a hotel is not required to have a hot tub to obtain 5 stars it was a major disappointment at the end of cold freezing rainy days to not be able to warm up in a hot tub sauna or steam! Also the pool is over chlorinated so we could not stand being in the room for more then 10 minutes as our eyes were burning. Seems odd that they would sink a fortune into this facility and put in 3 showers, but then not have basic amenities that every fancy spa we have been to has. By the way, I am not going to get an expensive massage at a facility that lacks these things when I can have a great massage for $60 an hour at my local nail salon. 

The housekeepers consistently tried to clean the room at odd times, 4pm the first day when were napping, 8:30am another day, despite us asking them to come when normal tourists are out and about (9am-3pm). Then turndown service at 6:30pm rather then when we were out at dinner (7-9pm). This seems to happen at other hotels, its very annoying and leaves the impression that they really are trying to avoid cleaning the room. If you do not have enough staff to clean the rooms at normal times, then you should not have turndown service, it is not something most people appreciate these days anyway. ",5,2018,04,05
120,Awesome hotel with a great bar!,"Stayed there a couple of nights traveling solo. The hotel’s distillery bar is an amazing spot that I can not recommend enough, the drinks selection will suit the the pickiest of drinkers and the staff are fun, knowledgeable and helpful. A special shout out goes to Liana, Justas, Kristina and Alex who served me up with a wide selection of guns and kept me entertained throughout the evening.",5,2018,04,02
120,Brilliant!,"Was in London for business and the office put me up at the Bankside. I've had the pleasure of staying at other Hiltons, but this one truly excelled in service and style. I was greeted by every person from the doorway to the front desk, in a manner that never felt forced. Check in was a breeze and they stored my bag so that I could wander around until my room was ready (It was quite early). It was less than an hour later, and 4 hours before check in that I received a text from Max that my room was ready. Room was nicely done, a tad small, but I expect that in any city setting (not like the dorm room size you find in NYC). Had dinner downstairs - excellent and stopped at the bar for a nightcap. The bartenders were...artists. This is the type of bar that has a signature style that goes along with the signature cocktails. One of the finest martinis I have ever had. Peter, the manager does a great job of bringing a sense of pride to every stir. The breakfast buffet is top rate, and they will even prepare your eggs if you want something different. Angelo and Paul helped with my checkout when I was delayed in a meeting. Two quick texts and everything was closed out. Perfect.

Service here again, first class. Thank you. Look forward to returning.",5,2018,04,02
120,Disappointed,"Was expecting a high caliber five star hotel. Was disappointed. The hotel is new but didn't give the feeling of a five star hotel. I would say it is a nice four star hotel. If considered as a four star hotel, it is fine",3,2018,04,02
120,"Beautiful Hotel, OK Stay Overall","The hotel itself is physically beautiful and definitely falls into the 5-star ranking. Service wise though, I would say it is 3.5 stars at best. In terms of HHonor Gold benefits, they deliver exactly what is written but nothing else and definitely do not go above and beyond that. 

Checking in, we had been told we were ""upgraded"" but not really sure what that meant since after arriving in our room, it looked exactly like a standard King room which made me wonder what the room I had booked looked like. Heck, after looking at the pictures, it seems that most king rooms have a day bed next to the window(s) when we definitely did not and had only two small window panes to look out of. Furthermore, after inquiring as to Lounge Access and even when we mentioned we would be more then happy to pay for it despite reading plenty of reviews stating it was offered to Gold members, we were told it was not even available. This already kind of left a stale taste after arriving to the hotel. The room itself was perfectly fine and definitely quite new, bathroom was also nice despite the half partition in the shower. 

Breakfast had plenty of good options and service was friendly, probably the highlight of the stay. Took a look at the gym and it was an about average size with decent equipment. Pool looked very lovely though. Location wise, it's about 8 minutes from the nearest Tube stop and directly next to the Tate Modern. overall a fairly quiet area of London. Would I come back? Maybe....the price was fairly decent for a London hotel but I would definitely look at other options as well.",4,2018,04,01
120,Family Drinks,"Popped in here for a few drinks before leaving london.

Service was pretty good.

Not the cheapest place but that way there is no trouble or undesireables hanging about.

We had some food which came out quick and was nice enough.

120,Stay away from this hotel,Have booked room with City view. Take a look at our pictures from our room 444 and decide for yourself!We also had a room including breakfast. On our last Day we had to leave at 6 am to catch our plane. Breakfast is from 6 am. The evening before we asked if possible to get breakfast in the room at 5.30 am. It was and we booked breakfast for only 1 person as did not want to cause any inconveneince (we are 3 persons). The breakfast delivered was poor and e.i the Bread Rolls we ordered was not delivered. On our Way to Gatwick we received an extra Bill for breakfast. Have stayed in other 5 Stars also leaving early and they do not charge breakfast when included and when not open early. Well that combined with this so called “City view” give the conclusion: STAY AWAY from this hotel. The 2 Stars is for the restaurant and the location.,2,2018,04,01
120,Good staff but does not live up to the hype,"The hotel is ok. Staff respond to requests and are very friendly and helpful. But with all the poetics being waxed about on FlyerTalk was expecting way more. Yes, I know it’s prob  because I’m just a puny gold member ... We get free breakfast and quite a free minibar. But don’t get too excited - the minibar is actually two bottles of water, one bottle of coke and one Diet Coke. Technically the bottled water is standard issue room free so all u get extra are two cokes - really?

Also, would be nice to have a coffee maker in the room ... if you stay and are fond of coffee ... what the raving reviews don’t tell you is you need your own coffee maker ...
Lastly, location is a bit far off unless you count Tate. Other than that a good hotel. 

I’m a bit disappointed. Next time, i will try the Conrad ...",3,2018,03,30
120,Expected so much more,"We were very much looking forward to our stay at Hilton Bankside, and had high expectations. I’ve visited London many times before, but this was the third time with my teenage daughter. Our previous stays has been at smaller boutique hotels, with excellent service and staff smalltalking to us, giving us the feeling of being home away from home.

I called Hilton Bankside a week or so before my stay, requesting a quiet room on a higher floor. The man I spoke to, confirmed this. I considered ordering breakfast too, so I asked if they had gluten-free options, but he couldn’t give me an answere. He set me over to the kitchen staff, but after waiting for a long time, I gave up.

Upon arrival, we got a room on the first floor. I told about the request and confirmation of a room higher up, but the lady from the staff told us that they were fully booked three days ago, and that the room wasn’t available. We could have a higher category room, if we paid more. I wanted the room I was promised, but she offered me a free drink in the bar instead. After some talking, she offered us a room on the 6th floor the next day, and we accepted. They reserved 100 pound on my credit card, in case we would have something from the mini bar.

My daughter didn’t think it was very cozy to live with clothes in suitcases on the floor, waiting for another room, so we decided to stay in the first room, trying to make it a bit like home. Before going out, we wanted a snack, and found the mini bar menu and prices in our room. Unfortunately the mini bar was empty, and the desk told us that a filled up mini bar only was for the higher category rooms.

Maid service varied from day to day. Some days, used glasses and coffee cups were removed and replaced. Other days we had to wash the glasses ourselves. Sometimes there were sheets on the bedside floors at night, sometimes not. Trash bin were emptied, but tables and surfaces weren’t washed.

We loved the bathroom, because it was spacious, modern and with a very good shower. The beds were wonderful, and contributed to good night’s sleep. The room was quiet, and we didn’t meet one single guest in the corridor or elevator, on this «very fully booked» hotel.

I don’t think we were very welcome, to be honest. And we certainly didn’t feel special. The staff treated people differently, and to us they were impersonal and slightly arrogant.

Next time, we will find a smaller hotel. A place were the owners do their best for every guest, because everyone is important. Now, we have one more day to stay at Hilton Bankside. When we leave, we will never come back.",2,2018,03,29
120,Pleasantly Surprised,I was a little worried staying over in this area of London but boy was I surprised. The hotel was out of this world!!  From the moment you walk into the lobby its 5* The hotel/rooms/staff are brilliant.  Its less than a 10min walk from the tube and easy distance of The Shard/Tower Bridge and lots of places to eat and do something.  Will definately be back,5,2018,03,26
120,My home away from home,"I've come to London on-and-off for the last 6 months and I have only stayed at this hotel. It's a great location - close to the City of London and a stone's throw away to some of the most interesting spots in London (Bourough Market, Tate Modern etc). Even though I'm primarily here for business, when I stay over the weekend with my husband, we both refuse to leave!

Mainly, we keep coming back for the great service from the staff all around. As soon as we arrive, the greeters are right there asking if they can help. I've often seen them run after cabs for guests and I know I'm always in good hands with them when I'm in a rush. 

Guest services is very accomodating. Individuals, like Luisa, try to make things work for me all the time when my schedule changes. You honestly just have to ask.

Breakfast is also great. The spread is one of the best I've seen with some very special touches upon occasion (e.g., Duck Eggs). Ali Onally cooks some of the best eggs to order and he always remembers exactly who I am and what I like.

The Concierge team is by far my favourite though. John always brings a smile to my face and has taken care of some of our odder requests (i.e., finding a meeting room in the middle of London for a lunch meeting). 

The only downside is that sometimes the cleaning service and room service can be a bit spotty. However, if you simply give the front desk a ring, they make sure everything is ok.  

I'll be very sad to go when I no longer come to London, but I highly recommend you give Hilton London Bankside a try whether you are here for business or pleasure. It does a great mix of both!",5,2018,03,25
120,Three days in London ,Stayed at the Bankside Hilton for our last three days of our tour. Mark at the front desk went above and beyond giving us places to eat and explore. Even took us outside to give us exact directions to places to see,5,2018,03,24
120,BEST Hotel in London,"I have previously reviewed this hotel as I stay here often for work, but having recently had a long weekend for my Grandmother’s birthday I felt I had to write another in recognition of the incredible service we received from staff throughout the weekend. My grandmother kept saying she felt like the queen due to the attentiveness of staff and their assistance in arranging things before hand was second to none.

If you are looking for a hotel for celebrating a special occasion or simply where you will be looked after like family this is the place to stay. 

Prior to our stay I had been in contact with the hotel to arrange for flowers to be delivered to my grandmothers room. Liz Thompson was incredibly helpful in the initial planning stages and really fast to reply to emails. Ana Maria Barbalata was also incredibly helpful, her eye to detail when helping me with the I al arrangements was outstanding - down to asking the exact flowers my grandmother would like in her bouquet. The little touches arranged by Ana and her team throughout the weekend were also delightful, from little treats in my grandmothers hotel room to a birthday cake and candles at our dinner - all arranged by the team completely without direction from me. 

Other staff who are guaranteed to ensure you have a fabulous stay and want for nothing are John Korteray (concierge) who was incredibly helpful in guiding my grandmother with arrangements for a day out whilst I was tied up with work. Chef Ali Asgar Onally on the breakfast service was never without a smile and nothing was too much trouble - he also makes the best omelettes! Finally Peter Biro in the bar made us incredible gin suggestions in the evening - encouraging us to try some of the many different and interesting gins in the Distillery Bar.

We left after our long weekend feeling thoroughly pampered and not at all like ‘just another customer’. The personal attentive service was second to none and I cannot thank them enough. 

",5,2018,03,22
120,my new favourite hotel,"lets start with check in  quick and simple non of that waiting for IT or staff to pay attention couldn't have been better,  
First Impressions of room Average it had a bed, wet room (I'd requested an accessible room)  and a TV  So did think why the 5 stars  but you soon see the attention to detail that makes the difference quite simply the comfiest bed I've ever slept in, I was thrown a bit with the tv sound going int o the bathroom as well but a neat idea,  
WiFi now this I had a problem with Free WiFi so clicked on complimentary WiFi but I think this was my error if you stay here click Guest WiFi as the complimentary only lasts 24hrs yet didn't disconnect me afterwards so no matter where I was in London I was connected to Hilton Honors wifi so struggled to use any other Wifi  once I'd worked out how to connect as guest (i had to do this everyday) it worked better but my phone WiFi settings hasn't been the same since clicking the 24hr complimentary on my first day Breakfast again this is spot on huge choice and helpful staff  Location is great half way between Waterloo and London Bridge stations but Southwark tube station is closest  and it's very close to tte modern. I can't wait to stay here again",5,2018,03,21
120,Convenient to the Tate Modern,"What made my stay here memorable was the X-mas stocking surprise hanging on our doorknob on Christmas day.  I thought it was a nice touch. Also, I mistakenly booked a room for someone with disability.  This was pointed out to me at check-in but i kept the room. It's nice to know that there is an accessible room catered to that population in the hotel.",4,2018,03,21
120,The PERFCETION in LONDON,"This is the BEST HILTON Hotel I've been staying in Europe, would even say one of the best Hotel in this category that I've been staying in Europe since a very long time  Very outstanding staff, management, area (close to everything) , rooms (design industrial), executive lounge (incredible space, cocktail), pool & gym are amazing, housekeeping staff and the breakfast at the restaurant is fantastic .... - . I'm travelling a lot and had barely met this level of excellence ! Go there you won't be disappointed - The perfection in London !",5,2018,03,21
120,Great stay in London!!!,"Our first time in Hilton Bankside, but surely not the last one. Great thanks to Amine at the check-in desk for the first class service!!!. 
Breakfast was sublime, never seen such a choice of fine food. Room was spacious and very clean.
See you next time!!!",5,2018,03,20
120,Very nice experience,"We enjoyed our stay at the Hilton Bankside ! Great design of lobby, restaurant and bar. The design of the room and bathroom is a mix of modern and cosy, thanks to beautiful choice of materials and light elements and expertise in finishings. 

Situated near the Tate it is very convenient. We even walked to Soho in the evening along the Thames (37 minutes). 

The breakfast was a real pleasure : so much choice, fresh prepared eggs in all varieties, pancakes... I've been to many hotels but this was very very nice. 

Valet car service was perfect and so convenient.

But above all the very friendly and discreet staff made it a relaxing stay. ",5,2018,03,18
120,Great cocktail bar,"We really enjoyed this Hilton, modern and contemporary with great rooms. The location is OK, with Southwark tube about a 5 mins walk. A great pool and Gym downstairs. The staff were lovely and we particularly enjoyed great cocktails served by Liana in the Distillery Bar 🍸",5,2018,03,18
120,Amazing hotel,"This hotel is in an amazing location in London very close to the main attractions. 
The room is stylish, modern and clean. The bathroom was amazing and loved the shower. The staff was very friendly and helpful. The restaurant downstairs was also very nice and the food was delicious. It was also a decent price for the meal!

Would definitely recommend to anyone!",5,2018,03,18
120,First Class,"This is a very pleasant hotel, ideally located away from the noise and crowds in the West End. We found our room to be very comfortable, quiet, cleaned to a high standard and very well equipped. 
The efficiency and helpfulness of the staff throughout the hotel was very noticeable, from the Front Desk, Housekeeping, Distillery Bar and the Breakfast staff. And the Breakfast has got to be one of the best in London. There is a huge choice for everyone, special thanks to Chefs Ali and Royston. How do keep your scrambled egg so creamy? Every other hotel always manages to serve it curdled and separated.
The hotel was full, but there was no waiting for anything. At check out, again no waiting.
We all know what we expect from a hotel stay, this hotel went way beyond our expectations.",5,2018,03,17
120,Very good but not excellent,"The hotel itself is great. The rooms were clean and fresh and the breakfast are amazing with a lot of choices. The downside for me was that I was hoping for a room upgrade as a gold honors but nothing happend, which is a shame.",4,2018,03,16
120,"Quiet, comfortable stay","Good location, decent size room, helpful staff. Our room looked straight into other building and no sky visible but it was quiet and comfortable. I would have liked a bath (don’t know if there are any rooms with one) but the shower was great. My request for extra tea and milk sachets was responded to immediately. Overall a very nice hotel.",4,2018,03,15
120,Fantastic Hotel,"Beautifully designed rooms. We booked an executive double and it was well worth it . The room was large, modern, well soundproofed, gorgeous bathroom with separate shower and we had access to the executive lounge . I have stayed in many London hotels and in terms of value for money and comforts this is close to the top.  Breakfasts had a large choice of hot and cold selection. We ate dinner in the hotel one evening and it surprised us how good the quality was. Highly recommend this place.",5,2018,03,13
120,One of the best Hiltons in the entire chain,"I am quite the Hilton loyalist, but I'll admit that not all Hilton properties are that great. Some are old, some feel cheap, some are in rough neighborhoods, but I stick with them for various reasons. This location - the Bankside - is hands down one of the best, if not best, Hilton properties I have ever stayed at.

The service is phenomenal and beyond helpful.
The rooms are very dark, very quiet, and the bed is the most comfortable hotel bed I've personally ever slept in.
The lounge and restaurant and bar are very quality for an in-hotel experience. Definitely stop by the bar and have a bespoke cocktail and go to breakfast in the Oxbo.

We used the gym in the basement, but after seeing the pool, we wish we would have brought our swim suits. Quite romantic down there.",5,2018,03,12
120,The best Hilton  in London,"I have just spent another great stay in the Hilton Bankside, and it just keeps getting better. A good location, great rooms, superb breakfast and lovely executive lounge. What more could you ask for. I have stayed in a lot of Hiltons in London and this is the one that gets my vote for number one. Stand out thanks to Cem who sorted out my room for me, superb service",5,2018,03,10
120,Average at best,"This is a fairly new hotel and is quite modern for London. The location is ok but it is not in a great tourist area like some reviewers seem to portray, so we were disappointed with location. This trip was for our 30th wedding anniversary, the checkin clerk could not have cared less and we received no recognition for our milestone. We were booked for an executive room with access to the executive lounge. First the room, on checkin we were told the room allocated was the only one available was on floor one, it was the darkest room we have ever experienced. The walls are dark with no art work or mirrors at all, it was like a dungeon. We were told we could be moved if another room became available in the next days but we could pay to upgrade, how convenient. The bathroom was freezing as there is no underfloor heating, it too is all dark colours. Overall the room was depressing, cold and unwelcoming. The saviour of this hotel was the executive lounge, a good selection of drinks, wine, beer, basic spirits and nibbles. only problem is at breakfast were the hot items are lukewarm at best( turn the heat warmers up). The prices in the bar are exceptionally overpriced. 
I would not recommend this hotel for tourists.",3,2018,03,07
120,Excellent Hotel,"We were 2 couples in 2 rooms. Our request for rooms together was honoured.  The hotel is very new and beautifully decorated, rooms are very spacious with all the amenities you would expect from a 5 star hotel.  The bathroom is lovely with a walk in shower. Breakfast was very good with an excellent selection. All staff from the doorman to house keeping are very polite and courteous.  There are no views from the rooms literally just a brick wall but we were expecting this and the hotel rooms more than make up for this.  The hotel is in a good location with Southwark tube just a couple of minutes away.  The Shard is only a 10 minute walk.  We will definitely be returning to this hotel. Thanks Hilton Bankside! ",5,2018,03,06
120,Another fantastic stay!,"We absolutely love the Hilton London Bankside. We come to London every year and we choose this property as our home away from home. We stayed for a long weekend in the beginning of March and once again, we were thoroughly impressed! This property has loads of style and ambiance. Very chic modern. From the front desk, to housekeeping, bar to executive lounge, staff is on point and they truly aim to please. We had a slight hiccup with bedding this year but it was rectified promptly and we were comped drinks in their lovey Distillery Bar. As I said before, the staff go above and beyond to make sure your stay is everything you expect and more. Location is also spot on! Bankside area is super hip and trendy and there is lots to see and do around the hotel. If you are looking for a fantastic hotel in a fabulous location in London, look no further! Hilton London Bankside ticks all the boxes! We will see you next year!",5,2018,03,06
120,Simply The Best,"Having managed to get an early flight in to London on Friday, before the snow storm came, I arrived as a bedraggled frozen traveller.  I was warmly greeted by Natasha at the Hilton Hons desk.  She welcomed me and informed me that I had been upgraded to a One Room Suite, with access to the Executive Lounge.  How wonderful.  After a speedy check in I was on my way to my room.  What a very professional Front Desk Team!
The room was fabulous.  The fixtures and fittings are of the highest quality, leaving you feeling that you are staying in a good friend's expensive London pad.  The air con works, the mini-bar is stocked with free soft drinks and snacks, the bathroom has a wonderful walk in rain shower - I could go on and on.  Lastly the room was quiet and the bed was so very comfortable that I slept like a contented baby.  The room was well looked after by the Housekeeping Team during my stay.
The Executive Lounge is the best I have ever encountered.  Afternoon tea of sandwiches, salmon snacks and a variety of sweet treats was spot on.  Early evening snacks and drinks were also very enjoyable.  Breakfast each morning was a veritable feast.  Well done Kitchen Team!
This is the best hotel in London, I have paid much more for a lot less.  
Keep up the good work and you will hit that Number 1 spot soon!",5,2018,03,05
120,Very Nice Hotel,"Relatively newly built, this is a very nice, modern and comfortable Hilton with a “homey” feeling. Staff is very attentive and service minded. The app check-in feature is really cooler allowing you to choose your room prior to arrivals and even order amenities and drinks prior to arrival. Can warmly recommend.",5,2018,03,05
120,Great Hotel,"Thoroughly enjoyed our stay here. Our room was perfect, the bed extremely comfortable with the best pillows by far I've had in a hotel and the room was super quiet. We had the bottomless brunch at the Oxbo restaurant, which was excellent. My only gripe was the hot selection at breakfast. The containers did not keep the food hot and were extremely fiddly to handle whilst juggling a plate as well. A big shoutout to Juan who was exceptionally helpful and polite. A credit to the hotel. I would definitely stay here again.",4,2018,03,04
120,Great location and staff,"I stayed here for mix of biz and personal travel.  7 days, starting Feb 7th, 2018.
*The property was modern and in excellent condition.  
*The staff were were all helpful and friendly.  I especially appreciated the help of Mark, who coordinated getting a coat sent to me in the States. I accidentally left it in the room when I checked out.  Also special recognition to Giacomo, a bartender who makes a killer Corpse Reviver!
*Breakfast upgrade is absolutely worth the price. Quality and variety in the offerings. 
*Location- Less than 5 minute walk to the Tate Modern where you can spend an entire day easily and The Globe Theater.  Short walk to some really excellent restaurants.  A few of our favorites were Baltic, Bala Baya, and Gordon Ramsay's Union Street Cafe (I I know he comes off as a horrible tyrant on the reality tv shows, but his staff actually like him and the food and service were excellent)
*Easy walk to the Southwark tube stop",5,2018,02,28
120,Welcoming with Excellent customer service ,"I discovered the hotel after visiting the restaurant OXBO for Sunday brunch.. amazing btw. Hotel has a Lovely feel, luxurious and modern without being too pretentious. I booked a weekend stay as a surprise for my daughters 21st birthday for her and her boyfriend. And obviously wanting to make it special for her I let the hotel know it was a big birthday and was throughly impressed with the little extra touches, including the birthday cake from the chef! The staff I spoke to prior to the visit were polite and helpful and very organised, I didn't have to explain myself each time I rang as notes had been put on my booking. The staff were warm and welcoming on arrival and It sounded like they went the extra mile to make them both feel welcome. They kept the mini bar full and frequently checked they had everything they needed. I also booked a treatment for my daughter in the spa and the ladies there were lovely too, giving her a glass of fizz whilst she waited. Can not fault the hotel at all, great base for a weekend in London my daughter was so happy. I don't usually write reviews but thank you for making their stay at the Hilton special! I'm going to have to book myself in I think :) ",5,2018,02,28
120,One of the best hotels in London,"Good price, great location, fantastic Club Lounge, and fabulous customer service all round. My little boy lost/dropped his coat, they found and delivered it back to us within 10 mins. They made us feel important, where other hotels simply fail.
Breakfast was very good, we never ate dinner here - but the Club Lounge drinks and snacks were excellent.
Small swimming pool only (albeit nice and warm), but would you expect much more in the center of London?
Tube station is an 8 min walk, and there are plenty of pubs/restaurants in the area too.
I won't labour the point, but this is one of the best all round hotels in London for the price. And most definately the best Hilton in the city - bar none we've stayed at. If you are a Diamond Hhonors member and need/want to stay in London - your search is over.",5,2018,02,27
120,Amazing but disappointed I didn’t get the room I paid for ,Stayed here for the weekend for a birthday treat for my boyfriends birthday. Arriving early the excellent staff got us a room when we arrived which was great however I booked a room with a king bed and paid extra and received a twin room only to be told I cant have one cause there fully booked and can’t change which seemed to me a little disappointing for a Hilton otherwise it was pristine and fabulous! Will come back ,3,2018,02,25
120,So much better than expected ,"Have now stayed here a number of times. Better than most Hilton's has an individual feel. Good size rooms, good bar and super breakfast. A favourite hotel to stay in for work or pleasure. Good value and an excellent location.",5,2018,02,25
120,Great hotel,"Went for a work trip and stayed here for one night. It's well located close to the tube and other communications. Also, just about 25-30 minutes walk to the centre, like the Covent Garden and Soho and perhaps 15-20 minutes walk from the London Eye.

Nice staff that welcomed me in the front desk, nice room and a really nice breakfast buffet in the morning.

Of course I managed to forget my keys in the room when I left but the hotel staff were really quick calling me so I could manage to pick up my stuff. Thanks for that commitment!

Perhaps just a little too expensive for my taste if I would have been on a family trip, but well recommended anyway!",5,2018,02,24
120,Lovely experience,"The hotel is located in the south bank, which is very convenient for riverside walks. Covent Garden and Leicester square are half an hour walk away and the metro station (Jubilee line) is five min walk away.
The breakfast is satisfying and the bar (The distiller) very good. The pool is an asset.",4,2018,02,22
120,Another fantastic stay!,"Stayed at many Hilton hotels around the world as diamond members.  This is one of the best, especially the executive lounge.  Good to be looked after again by Gergely who is always excellent - nothing is ever too much trouble.  Not surprised he won a trip to Paris, voted for by his colleagues.  Only shame was we couldn’t get into the restaurant for brunch on the Saturday afternoon - fully booked... but afternoon tea in the lounge was good.  All in all a really good hotel.",5,2018,02,21
120,Wonderful hotel,"This hotel is absolutely gorgeous!
I would definitely stayed here again. I had a few nights booked for work, the location was great, the service was brilliant - the staff are very friendly and kind. I didn't eat at the hotel, but the room was brilliant, very clean and the amenities were always replenished the nect day during service. 

I would definitely stay here again and I will definitely be recommending this hotel as well.",5,2018,02,20
120,Excellent Hotel with Matching Service,"Having stayed at numerous Hilton properties, I can definitely say the Hilton Bankside was one of my most pleasurable stays in recent memory.  Being a fairly newer hotel, the rooms are sized very well, with nice furniture and great amenities.  Perhaps one of the most comfortable beds I've slept in!  In addition, there is an excellent restaurant and a bar attached to the restaurant, as well as a top notch executive lounge.  But what makes the whole hotel come together is the amazing staff and the effort they put in to making sure my experience was one to be remembered.  From the front desk staff to the concierges to the chambermaids, everyone was phenomenal.  And if you're staying there hopefully you'll have George helping you, he is a prime example of the level of employees they have, helping me on numerous occasions with questions about the hotel or bringing by extra supplies that I had run out of.  Overall, I highly recommend staying at this Hilton property if you are in the area, and even if you are not in the direct vicinity, the Jubilee line is a short five minute or less walk away, which can get you to anywhere in the city!",5,2018,02,20
120,Simply Superb!,"I stayed here for a Friday night in February.  I requested an early check in and everything was ready for me and my partner, when we arrived a little after midday and we were even given an upgrade to a deluxe room!  First rate!  The rooms are nice and airy and have a huge shower in the modern bathroom.  We didn't get to use the executive lounge facilities but we did enjoy the great selection at breakfast.  The hotel is ideally situated on the south bank just behind the Tate Modern and within a few hundred metres of Borough Market, the Shard, London Bridge station etc.  A lovely stay and I would thoroughly recommend this hotel and the wonderful staff.",5,2018,02,19
120,Super Hotel,"Excellent brand new hotel. 
We stayed one night at the hotel, excellent service, room and design, really enjoyed our stay, highly recommend.
Dinner at the restaurant was delicious, the only thing it was a little bit too dark at the restaurant. 
Breakfast has a lot of healthy choices but the was no bake beans. ",5,2018,02,17
120,Nice hotel - service shockingly bad,"This hotel is one of the five star Hilton properties in London. I have visited about four times now (plus I have put up friends and family here for about eight times) and every time I have admired the great interior design of this hotel. From the calm modern rooms to the industrial touches that are present throughout the hotel, I believe this hotel is one of the most well-designed hotels in London. However, the service in this hotel is completely lacking. The hotel staff all have a flair of arrogance which is probably related to the ""five star"" rating that not a lot of Hiltons in London have. The staff at breakfast is lacklustre and forgetful but the worst are the people at the front desk who completely fail to acknowledge HHonors status and make you feel like every extra request is just a burden for them. In my case I left angry at the staff for their arrogance and unwillingness to do anything beyond the bare minimum for me. I promised myself I will never stay here again and have since also stopped putting up my family and friends here. I recommend either the Waldorf Hilton, Hilton Canary Wharf or even Hilton London Metropole instead of this ""palace of arrogance"". My complaint to the general manager was never answered so I assume this property just does not value my custom.",2,2018,02,15
120,Great service,Had a two night stay here in November and the service was fantastic. Great food and amenities. Would definitely recommend to others. The concierge was amazing with fantastic local knowledge of the area.,4,2018,02,15
120,Beautiful hotel - the little touches make all the difference.,"My boyfriend and I recently stayed here for two nights and it was a wonderful experience from start to finish. It is all the little extra touches that make this hotel special and offer a bit of luxury. We received excellent (and very respectful) service from every staff member we encountered. The bedroom was so comfortable with a beautiful bed and a modern, stylish, and spotlessly clean bathroom. The turn down service in the evening was a lovely touch, as was the bathroom speaker! We had breakfast both mornings of our stay which we found to be fresh, delicious, and plentiful. The bar was a perfect place for a nightcap at the end of the day. I wouldn't hesitate to recommend this hotel and I hope to return again in the not so distant future!",5,2018,02,15
120,Lovely one night stay on points ,"Booked and exec room with executive lounge access.  We were upgraded to a junior suite.   Very clean and funky hotel, exec lounge served afternoon tea and scones, plus we popped in for a couple of glasses of wine and a vodka before heading out. 

Great location for Tate modern or London television studios.  Lovely stay. 

Heavy on points and not cheap to book and pay, but it was the night into valentines.   
",5,2018,02,14
120,Very nice ,"Very nice hotel, friendly staff and modern rooms. I’m taking off a star because the room service food was horrible, pizza was like a frozen one you’d buy in a shop and the burger wasn’t good either. I went to a restaurant near by, cheaper and a lot better tasting, otherwise it’s a nice place (breakfast is excellent) ",4,2018,02,11
120,Consistent 5 Star Service,We are regulars at Hilton Bankside and have just completed our third stay of 2018. The reason this hotel is our first choice when we are in London is the consistency of service. We are always well looked after and the staff are so friendly and helpful. Modern hotel with cosy quiet rooms and fantastic breakfast keep us coming back time after time.,5,2018,02,11
120,"Friendly staffs, great location but the breakfast needs to be improved","Great location with the Shard is only 15min away by foot. Staffs are friendly and well trained. However, the breakfast is so overpriced and it does not served to a Hilton Standard. The bacon was dry, the sausage is the cheapest one you can find in any supermarket and the roasted tomatoes were tasteless. It is not worth the £20 price tag. This is the biggest let down for my stay. ",4,2018,02,11
120,An exceptional hotel  ,"Little note  to hotel designers!  Please include a mirror in the room near a power point for straighteners!  

Apart from that this is a stunning hotel, with great staff and impeccable attention to detail. Loved it ",5,2018,02,11
120,Another Great Stay,"We stayed 3 nights in early January for our 3rd stay at this wonderful, Hilton property.  There was some confusion at check-in as I asked for a room with a tub.  She said ok, but when we arrived-No tub!  I called the front desk and after a call back and an apology, another Executive room was found for us with a tub.  One of the young gentlemen in the lobby came up with our new keys and walked with us to our new room.  From there, everything went well.  The lounge was inviting as always and saved us the extra expense of dining and drinking out as we were able to do it all there, including afternoon tea.  The wifi worked excellently plus it was quiet enough most of the time to do some reading.  The gentleman from Hungary (not Peter, who was on vacation this time), but the one a few years older took great care of us when he was there as did others as well.  We had breakfast each morning in the main restaurant with omelets made to order plus many other selections.  My only concern there was coffee refills could be slow.  As Diamond, we enjoy to be pampered, and this Hilton is still our favorite one-not only in London but worldwide.  I have become more acquainted with the neighborhood and now feel very comfortable staying in this peaceful, gentrified part of London.  We found a great restaurant called the Prince of Wales about 20 minutes' walk southwest from here near Elephant & Castle station.  It's also an easy walk over the pedestrian bridge to St. Paul's where we attended the main service with choir and formality.  The bus stops nearby make it easy to connect anywhere in London-east to the Tower and west to Harrods and more.  Blackfriars station nearby makes connecting to Gatwick very easy as well, and the walk to/from is pleasant, even with luggage in tow.  This is our ""go-to"" place in London, and we hope to be back again in 2018!",5,2018,02,09
120,Very very good!,"Somewhat unprepossessing from the outside, but a really great quality hotel. Clearly fairly new, with high standard of decor, good rooms and delightful staff.
Breakfast exceptionally good
A really pleasant place to stay.",5,2018,02,02
120,"Wow, I don't know if there is possibly anything less than excellent about this hotel.","I don't know if there is possibly anything less than excellent about this hotel. 
I really enjoyed my two night stay here: staff is super friendly and helpful, food is delish, rooms are so amazing: interesting design, cool lightning, super comfortable huge beds, room has everything necessary: fans, minibar, iron, teapot etc etc. 
Unfortunately didn't have any time to enjoy the pool and gym... 
Love it so so much, thank you!",5,2018,02,02
120,Great property for a reasonable (for London) price.,"It's a great property for the business traveler:  near the river, plenty of restaurants, and the business district isn't too far off.  The staff are very friendly, bar's not too shabby, and the facilities are very comfortable.  The price pushed my corporate budget a bit, but that's London.",5,2018,02,02
120,Continues to deliver,"Arrived by car and greeted by the lovely Andrei the doorman who welcomed us back in his usual charming manner.  It's so nice to be remembered considering how many guests must pass through their doors.  Our room was terrific, the pool is really gorgeous.  We had afternoon tea in the Executive Lounge on Friday 12th and Elvira was extremely attentive and very professional.  Gergely was lovely at breakfast on Sunday.  This hotel is marvellous but actually what really raises it is it's genuinely great staff.",5,2018,02,01
120,Excellent hotel,"Stayed one night here as I was attending a function nearby, that apart...this would be my recommendation and ""go to"" Hilton for central  London as the stay was excellent, the hotel well located and I am looking forward to returning.

As a gold member, received an upgrade to a deluxe king size room.  The hotel is fairly new and I loved both the room and shower-room, tastefully done and a very good size...still with a ""new"" feel to them and immaculately clean! The decor and standard of fittings was excellent.

Nice staff, very good bar (especially with the Sunday evening happy hour) and I can't think of anything remotely bad to say!  An excellent stay and I'll be back!",5,2018,01,29
120,Great Hotel - minor niggles to improve,"Overall we had a great experience at this hotel. Great location literally just behind Tate modern. Good surrounding bars & restaurants in easy access. Modern new hotel with all mod cons. Some have raised issue around bar prices, but £10-11 for a proper cocktail in London isn't actually bad at all, especially as they were really good (Mind & soul recommended, real honeycomb a great touch).
Minor suggestion for improvement - we were told there was complimentary soft drinks/water in the room, however this meant 2x water, 1 britvic orange / 1 coke. if you are going to provide this then at least supply enough for the 2 people paying for the room. 1x 200ml coke does't go far between 2 people. Breakfast - excellent selection to cater for all tastes in general, but at risk of sounding fussy some beans with your full English would be good. Also at a higher end hotel I would expect fresh tea and coffee rather than pre-prepared tea in a flask poured at the table. We were given a large pot on the second day after asking our server(Juan I think) who was very friendly and happy to help, but this surely should be standard.",4,2018,01,29
120,Up there with the best of Hilton,"I had a one night stay at Hilton Bankside and wasn’t disappointed. Extremely comfortable bed and top notch service at check in. As a Gold member the lady on reception informed me of all my benefits and welcomed me with open arms.

I don’t usually stay at this Hilton as my office is in Canary Wharf but having this option is good and I’d be willing to stay here in the future, I recommend for further business and leisure travellers.",5,2018,01,29
120,Fantastic,"What a wonderful hotel! The location is perfect, and close to lovely restaurants and riverside walkways. The whole hotel was spotless, whilst my room was bright, airy, and very comfortable. I did not eat/drink at the hotel, or use the spa/pool, but the services I did use were exemplary - I will return here, and I would recommend this hotel to others!",5,2018,01,28
120,The most comfortable superking bed! ,"Location:
Perfect location - between two tube stops, Southwark and London Bridge. Really great to explore the attractions nearby but also only 16 minutes to get you to Soho. 

Hotel Reception:
Stylish and welcoming. We were able to check into our room early on a Saturday which is an amazing bonus and we had arrived early just to drop our bags off! A very friendly welcome and swift check in. 

Room: 
I had a king deluxe room on the fourth floor. A HUGE superking bed and honestly one of the best nights sleep I’ve had in a Hilton hotel. It was quite at night time, I was away from the lifts and couldn’t hear any noise from the bars / restaurants downstairs. Lovely bathroom, bath robes and some complimentary soft drinks in the mini bar.

Executive lounge:
I only accessed in the evening but really enjoyed the facility, the very friendly staff and lots of flowing prosecco! In the morning we opted to face breakfast in the Oxbo restaurant rather than in here as there was a wider choice. 

Oxbo restaurant:
Used the restaurant for breakfast on Sunday morning. Arriving for breakfast at about 8.15 it was very quiet - I definitely recommend going early. An hour later the restaurant was much much busier. We had a very attentive service from being served drinks quickly, to ordering waffles and omelettes to order from the chef. Really impressed with the quality and range of options, including gluten free options too. 

Swimming pool/gym/spa:
There is a lovely pool in the hotel, it’s 1.2m all the way across. I had a lovely refreshing swim. The only downside here was the jacuzzi had some water coming out of the jets but didn’t seem to get really ‘bubbly’. Also the temp of the jacuzzi area was the same as the pool which was cool rather than warm. The guy on the spa reception was so helpful by getting me a spare robe as I had forgotten mine in my room. Great changing facilities and no coins required for lockers. Around the pool there are only 5 loungers so getting there early worked well. 

Overall, I’m really impressed and am really looking forward to coming back to London to stay here again! ",5,2018,01,28
120,Room not as advertised and no deposit refund,"I stayed at the Hilton Bankside prior to Christmas. I travel alot to London with work but it was my first time staying here. I had high expectations for the hotel. My room booking was advertised as King Deluxe Room with City View which I paid extra on top of the King Deluxe. On checking into my room, there was no view other than a wall which I had suspected once I was issued a room on the second floor. I went to reception to advise I had booked a ""City View"" room and was asked what I room I had expected as the hotel was surrounded by buildings. This is London so not unusual not to have views but my issue was in the advertisement of the room. 
The second night I was moved to a room with a glimpse of the Shard so the issue was rectified. This room was not available on my first night despite my booking.
The rest of my stay was enjoyable, the room was decent and restaurant and bar were lovely.
The main reason for my low rating is that despite weeks of chasing and a month after I stayed at the hotel, I have not been refunded my room deposit of £150. I am a regular resident in hotels and never before have I experienced such a delay. In fact I wonder if I didn't chase, would I have received it at all! I was advised on the 22nd that I would have it in 48 hrs but to this date I still don't have it.

I warn all guest to follow up on your bank account after staying to make sure this is returned as it would be very easy to presume it has been.",1,2018,01,25
120,Bankside continues to impress,I have stayed at the Hilton Bankside a half dozen times over the past few years and I am always amazed at how well run the hotel is. Every employee is polite and pleasant. The rooms are wonderfully laid out. The location is excellent. The lounge is the best of any Hilton I’ve stayed at and well worth paying for when one does not have Diamond status. If I could give this hotel 6 stars I would!,5,2018,01,24
120,Disappointing ending to a good stay,"I would have really loved to have given this hotel a higher rating but sadly I had left an (inexpensive but important) item in the bedroom - and when I called the hotel (only 90 mins after checking out) to explain that I would pop back and collect it, I was told that the room had not been cleaned yet, so they will retrieve the item and return it to me. 
However after several reminders to the hotel, I never got the item back and I never heard back from this apparently 5 star hotel. It was not a precious item but I know it was definitely in the room - and this matter should have been handled much more professionally. Just disappointing that there is dishonesty at such a good brand.
Otherwise it was a good stay..",3,2018,01,24
120,Conveniently located,"This is an urban-chic hotel located close to Southwark underground station and 2 minutes walk from the Tate. Many eateries in close proximity make this hotel an excellent choice to explore the city.
The room was nice and clean (although view wise it faced a nice brown brick wall), beds very comfortable and bathrooms with Bose speakers. Front desk staff attentive.
Having stayed at many 5 star hotels in town, I would probably give this hotel a class of 4 maybe 4.5 stars as it does not manage to contend with other 5 star hotels in the area. On a deal price I would stay again, although the full rate does not seem appropriate for the value.",4,2018,01,22
120,Amazing customer service and superbly childfriendly hotel,"Have just returned from amazing weekend trip to London. We stayed two nights at the Hilton Bankside with my 6 year old daugher and loved every minute of our stay. I must say that the service from check-in all the way to check-out was perfect! The hotel really has put efforts in their customer service and it really shows in a very natural and pleasant way. They also have an amazing eye for serving the younger visitors as well. Treasure hunting, tailor-made slippers and bathrobes together with spa toiletries were just a few of the most evident things that comes to mind. My six year old felt like a princess who received special treatment, as it should be. Thank you Hilton Bankside for making our mom and daughter weekend perfect! 

The swimming pool is good in size, breakfast amazing with (too) many choices to eat. Kids menu at the restaurant really good (build your own sundae!). Location is convenient, rooms nice and clean and beds perfect! Nothing to complain about! We are sure to come back on our next visit to London! ",5,2018,01,22
120,Very very good,"This is a great Hilton hotel located close to Tate museum.
New installations, very good service.    Bed was extremely good.
The restaurant and the bar are above average.
Marc, the concierge, is very knowledgeable and provides very detailed information for whatever you need.",5,2018,01,21
120,Best London hotel,"Spent a long weekend here and the rooms are superior to many hotels I have stayed in in London, everything in the hotel is fresh, the rooms are very spacious, clean and the housekeeping staff as well as all the other staff from booking in, the restaurant, and concierge are very attentive and always have a smile.
The hotel is very well situated in bankside which is now a very up and coming are of London, in fact you can see that this are and the surrounding area is now a favourite for many visitors with the accessibility to the Tate gallery and the Millennium bridge which takes you across the Thames to St Paul’s cathedral, the walk along the embankment is fantastic and takes you to either Tower bridge to the right or Westminster bridge to the left. We have walked both ways and have explored Borough market. This really is a great hotel to stay in to enjoy the sites south of the river.",5,2018,01,20
120,The best Hilton in London by far,"we have stayed in most of the other Hiltons in London and this is the favourite, you get what you pay for, it still looks new, the staff are a credit to the brand, the rooms are comfortable and have the best duvets and pillows ever. you get complimentary soft drinks in a deluxe room. it is worth upgrading to an executive room as the lounge is lovely and the food and beverages on offer are better than any of the other Hiltons. The breakfast is great you just need to be very hungry as there is so much to choose from. its near to southwark station which makes it a really quick journey into the west end for theatres. The only negative - don't pay for parking at the hotel its extortion and there is a car park diagonally opposite which is much much cheaper!",5,2018,01,16
120,Great service and atmosphere,"It was such a pleasant surprise. The hotel is very beautifully decorated, exceptionally clean, and very comfortable. 

The gym is small but well appointed. 

The staff really couldn't do more to help and go the extra mile. 

Would thoroughly recommend. 

Bar serves very cool cocktails.",4,2018,01,15
120,My stay,stayed over on a business trip hotel was superb and staff excellent  really enjoyed my stay and put me in good shape for next days work.  Will be more than happy to stay here next time and bring the family too,5,2018,01,15
120,Service Above & Beyond,"My wife and I had planned a trip to take my 82 year old mother to Amsterdam, Paris, and London.  During our flight over my mother got sick and we were told by the airline they wouldn’t let her fly back without oxygen and we would have to rebook her flight.  When we arrived at the Hilton, I immediately asked the Concierge for help in locating a doctor, and explained the situation.  While I don’t remember names very well, the Concierge went out of his way to help us and the entire staff could not have been any nicer or more helpful.  We found a doctor and had my mother checked out, she was eventually cleared to fly and we were all able to enjoy the rest of the trip.  The executive lounge was a wonderful place to rest and refresh at the end of each day with canapés and drinks.  The bar had the best chicken bacon club sandwich I ever had in my life.  The rooms were beautiful and restful after each long day of sight seeing.  I couldn’t recommend this Hilton enough.  My 82 year old mother said she had never stayed at such a wonderful hotel and would only stay here if she could go back to London.  My wife and I will definetly be back.",5,2018,01,14
120,Beautiful Hotel in a convenient location ,"

This is a beautiful hotel with a convenient location just minutes away from Blackfriars Station.  Every member of the hotel staff we encountered was polite and courteous. We had an Executive room with access to the Executive lounge which came in handy after visiting the sights all day and wanting something light to eat before dinner. The reason for only 4 stars, was our King bed was actually two twin beds pushed together and my husband kept sinking in the middle.  This is not a deal breaker for this hotel; but in the future, I will call ahead and request an actual King Bed.",4,2018,01,13
120,Great,"The hotel is situated in a great central location. Nearby parking and local
Shops make the stay really good. 

The staff are brilliant. The location is quiet enough to get a good nights rest. 

Would definitely recommend this Hilton",5,2018,01,09
120,Great hotel - excellent staff,Great mix of business and a family holiday. I took my family with me on a work trip over the New Year and this hotel was perfect. The Suite was great for a family...and the executive lounge was wonderful for breakfast and evening happy hours. The room was always made up promptly and the staff was always very friendly which made the stay more enjoyable.,5,2018,01,07
120,Outstanding!,"This hotel is outstanding in all areas, but especially in the professionalism, friendliness and helpfulness of all members of staff. We were made to feel valued and warmly welcome from start to finish, and thoroughly enjoyed our whole experience. A fabulous hotel - to be highly commended, and recommended.",5,2018,01,07
120,Truly spectacular occasion,"We had a wonderful stay one night as we had theatre tickets and afternoon tea booked the next day so I booked the hotel so we didnt need to rush home and could stay over in London whoop whoop,
The staff were all very welcoming helpful and every person had a smile and a hello for us beautiful decor and very clean and quiet it was an anniversary treat and all at Hilton made it a truly spectacular occasion even though they never knew it was an anniversary.",5,2018,01,06
120,Excellent staff,"From my experience at this particular Hilton I would like to express my gratitude for such great staffing.

From the lad at the door helping with luggage, the receptionists above duty effort and also one lady that really stood out for her great sense of kindness with service is Maria the young German lady at the bar, I was so impressed on how she handle costumer service that I insisted on writing her a review and going through the effort of downloading trip advisor in order to do so! Absolute gem to your company.",5,2018,01,06
120,Great comfortable stay,"The hotel is located about a quarter of a mile or a 5 min leisurely walk from Southwark Station, just a stones throw away from Tate Modern. You can tell that the hotel is relatively new from its contemporary and untired look. The rooms are incredibly comfortable- great beds, important small touches like mirrors in the bathroom that don't fog,  adjustable reading lights, a big spacious pull-out refrigerator- the rooms are put together very well. No tubs or bidet though. The services at this hotel are also topnotch. The Christmas stockings were a pleasant surprise. Enjoyed the breakfast spread at Oxbo- eggs stations, many cooked items, a selection from the bakery, fruits, cereals, also congee...  It will be great if they added more accompaniments for the congee though. But all good. The fitness room at the basement is well-equipped, and the heated lap pool is maintained very well. This hotel deserves an excellent rating. 

As a side note, we had dinner on Christmas Day at Oxbo and were underwhelmed. Steak was not cooked to specification and the scallops appeared unfresh.",5,2018,01,05
120,Really lovely friendly hotel,"This hotel is lovely ,the rooms are a very good size and furnitured to a high standard,the staff were so friendly from the management to house keeping.we will be visiting again . My only criticism would be that the drinks in the bar were so expensive ",5,2018,01,05
120,Great stay,Brilliant hotel. Wonderful staff.The hotel has a perfect location. The interior is beautifully designed. Every single member of staff went out of their way to make the family's stay both enjoyable and memorable.,5,2018,01,05
120,Leisure ,"I was an amazing stay , the staff was great , outstanding service , I would like to say special thanks to: Lenka from the reception , Rita from the executive lounge , and Alex from OXBO restaurant, they are an asset to the company that you can be proud of and are very professional. We strongly recommend this Hotel for their facilities and amazing service.",5,2018,01,02
120,Superb above and Beyond experience ,"We stayed at the Hilton London Bankside for New Years holiday with our two year old daughter. I cannot say enough about this hotel and their staff. We have stayed at several Hilton hotels and always had a good experience, however this was above and beyond. Our concierge was a delight to see every day and really engaged our daughter. All of the staff was extremely friendly and helpful and made you feel very special and treated you with such warmness. Would definitely stay here again next time we are in London and will recommend this to anyone I know coming to London in the future!",5,2018,01,02
120,Fantastic hotel in a great location,"We had such a brilliant stay here that we have already booked to return.  Everything was superb, from location to our suite and the executive lounge.  We stayed in a huge one bedroom suite, which was extremely comfortable and spacious.  The separate sitting room was a great place to relax and unwind.  On our first evening, we ate in the OXBO restaurant at the hotel, which was excellent.  The executive lounge is one of the best we have experienced in the Hilton portfolio, which a superb food and beverage offering and, in our opinion, a better breakfast than in the main restaurant - a rarity.  Our only regret was not trying the swimming pool, but we shall have to fit that in next time.  Great location and value for money.",5,2018,01,01
120,Cosy brand new hotel in Central London,"Lovely hotel in Central London, 2 min walk from the Tate Modern. Cosy bedrooms, comfortable bathrooms, very kind staff and trendy bar. Enjoy the nice swimming pool in the morning before discovering best London areas.",5,2017,12,30
120,Wonderful Hotel,"A warm welcome; stunning decor, twinkling lights, friendly staff, divine scents. 

The room was a standard size, comfortable large bed, smooth linen, heavy duvet and perfect pillows. 

We felt well looked after throughout our stay. Definitely more than worthy of the 5 stars and glowing reviews. 

We will return.

120,Lovely Christmas Experience,This is the third year my partner and i have stayed at the Hilton Bankside on Christmas Eve as my family live nearby but do not have enough accommodation for us. The Hilton is a great experience at Christmas - complimentary mince pies and mulled wine on Cheistmas Eve - Christmas Stocking delivered on Christmas morning and the atmosphere and decor very festive. I booked rooms for my two daughters this year as well - they loved it. Thankyou Hilton. ,5,2017,12,28
120,"Great location, Mixed Bag on everything else","Great location but questionable value for money. The meal options are limited and some choices overpriced. Would avoid in-room dining (tray charge+ ""discretionary"" service charge)- can see you paying approx 45 GBP for a fairly basic meal that you could get from McDonald's for 5GBP. Also a bit of a mixed bag on the service front. The front-desk staff are great, however other staff, particularly the restaurant staff, seemed indifferent and inconsistent with their service delivery. Far preferred the Hilton in Canary Wharf- which incidentally was cheaper at the time of my stay in this particular Hilton.",3,2017,12,28
120,Best stay ever,This is a very nice 5 star hotel. They made my Christmas holiday wonderful. The room we got was very clean and spacious. We asked for a room with a bath and they were happy to give it to us without a fuss. The bed was very comfy! The service was perfect and the breakfast buffet was very lovely. The staff are friendly. The amenities were complete. And the location was spot on. There's nothing more I could ask for. I felt at home and very comfortable. I would definitely recommend this hotel and would definitely come back soon!,5,2017,12,28
120,Excellent couple of nights in the capital,"My wife and I stayed here between Christmas and New Year 2016 whilst in England. Superb modern hotel with excellent bar and friendly, welcoming staff. The location is excellent just a short walk to Southwark or London Bridge stations or across to all the sites of South Bank. Can’t recommend this hotel enough it was the perfect base to catch up with friends and explore this part of London. ",5,2017,12,27
120,Great Hotel in the center of London,"We spend a long weekend in Hilton Bankside, they were really helpful. We let send our Adele tickets to them, they keep them safe and had them ready when we arrived. All was prepared. The room was pretty with extra room, the Executive Lounge was British style, all perfect.",5,2017,12,25
120,Excellent stay,"I recently had a pretty much perfect stay at the Hilton London Bankside.  There are plenty of Hilton properties in London, and to date I've stayed about half of them.  And this one exceeded all of the others.  Service was impeccable, with Luisa at the front desk going above and beyond to make sure the stay was great.  The breakfast buffet was absolutely wonderful.  The executive lounge was a great haven.  The room was beautiful and the bathroom was spacious.  The location was great, tucked right behind the Tate Modern.  Easy to get to the tube, and also super-convenient for a connection to Gatwick.  Looking forward to visiting this property again.",5,2017,12,23
120,Excellent Service & Hotel,"Stayed to celebrate my wife’s birthday. Booked a room with breaky and access to the executive lounge. 

There is no parking available however they do a pricey valet service. I parked at the NCP London Bridge which is a 15 minute walk and cost half the price for 24 hours. Hotel let you drop off unload and then go park. 

Staff were lovely. Atmosphere was very good and very Christmas. 

Room was beautiful. Comfortable. Spacious. Clean. Bathroom was lovely too. Had the best night sleep ever. Amazing bed and most comfy pillows. 

We had a minor maintenance issue as the air con vent behind a cupboard was rattling but Michal the maintenance guy came and took care of it in a flash!

Breaky was delicious as was the eggless pancakes they made to surprise my wife! Totally awesome. 

Executive Lounge is amazing and a must ! V comfy and good options. Was really happy with this. 

The pool was used too and that too was nice and clean. Nice whirlpool. Only negative was it doesn’t have hot water in the whirlpool. 

Anyway a huge thank you to the whole team here. You guys rock and we appreciated the great service!!

Oh and thank you for the piece of surprise birthday cake for my wife waiting for us in the room.

120,Vacation visit,"Second stay at this Hilton and it was excellent. Staff and facility are top notch. Love staying in this area it has less noise and easy access to all of London.

120,Hilton Bankside What A Stay!,"This month I stayed with my partner at The Hilton Bankside and could not have had a better experience. We travelled all the way from Oxfordshire and were relieved when our luggage was taken from us at the door by the Conciege. Made me feel like Prince Harry! I'm not him (though people say we could be brothers). 

Check-in was fast and informative, we had very few questions about the features of the hotel by the time we reached our room; and what a room! Cool, modern feel to the decor, a mini fridge/drawer compartment to cater to any mood and a freshly-cleaned atmosphere facilitated by the maid 'Maria' (I know her name because she wished us a good stay in the form of a note).

After spending 20 mins in the Executive Lounge (2 glasses of Prosecco and plenty of complimetary nibbles) we had the most fantastic meal in the Oxbo hotel restaurant. If you stay at the Hilton BS, eat in. Do not book elsewhere, the menu is excellent (my partner does not eat much so I experienced enough of it myself). Excellent wine, smokey pancetta-scallops and Steak and Chips...outstanding! 

We were meeting friends that night, but we dropped in on The Distillery hotel bar before we left and could have stayed all night. The Italian bar staff were superb with us. Charming, knowledgable and passionate about their drinks, it was a pleasure occupy the stools. My favourite cocktail (French 75) made excellently to start. When the staff started making drinks from the 'Signature' menu I was truly blown away: I had a gorgeous Christmas-y cocktail garnished with caramelised nuts, red currents, cinnamon and icing sugar and my girlfriend enjoyed a Sushi-inspired cocktail complete with raw salmon, cucumber and Wasabi Gin! Exceptional service from a team who know their menu and enjoy their art. Good job.

I said we were meeting friends; I woke up feeling as you would expect (too many sushi cocktails?). My morning was perfectly remedied with an exceptional continental breakfast in the hotel. Smoked salmon, French brie and ham on toast, sausages, streaky bacon, scrambled eggs (what's the secret to keeping it in perfect condition on a buffet? Tell me please!!) pancakes, waffles, fresh grapefruit and orange juice, both types of porridge (one is rice-based with soy sauce, on is oat-based)...I could go on forever! So impressed. 

I can't thank the Hilton Bankside enough for a wicked experience. The staff are precise, well-mannered and never slipped from a smile. I would advise any sophisticated succesful artist (or art enthusiast) visting the Tate Modern to use this Hotel for your stay. Thanks again for your time, keep doing what you're doing.

The SUSHI COCKTAIL from distillery bar is a must try. Was so amazed how the sushi cocktail tasted superb when it sounded weird to me at first. I guess they do know how to satisfy your tastebuds!
•
Also, oxbo‘s food was really tasty and good in portion as well when I had my dinner there. We had scallops, smoked salmon, beef and cod, and everything was cooked into perfection!
they also serve amazing breakfast with various variety. not a morning person but I’m so glad I woke up for it

Also, what I love about Hilton most is that they have a classy, quiet lounge where they serve free flow alcohol drinks and light food til dinner time. You can choose to have breakfast here if you prefer a more quiet area for breakfast.

I had to fight the urge to stay in my room instead of exploring London. 😫 But I guess that pretty much explains how comfy the room was, right?

Will definitely LOVE to be back again x ❤️ ",5,2017,12,22
120,Very comfortable stay,"My husband and I stayed at the Hilton Bankside for 1 night to attend his office party being held in the ballroom of the hotel. We received a very friendly welcome and check in was very quick.  Our room was on the first floor and I did worry that it might suffer from road noise but this was not the case.  It was very quiet, warm and comfortable and had all the amenities needed for a very pleasant stay.  I would happily recommend this hotel to a friend, especially if they were wanting a hotel close to the Tate, Borough Market etc",5,2017,12,21
120,Quality hotel & amazing Sunday dinner,"Beautiful hotel, very peaceful and comfortable stay. Fantastic value and quality three course Sunday meal in oxbo restaurant. I was in heaven with the all you can eat starters and puddings, and fantastic quality.",5,2017,12,20
120,Great Location ,"First of all, I would like to start by saying the staff was fantastic! One of the surprising things I liked about this hotel was the size of the rooms, it was spacious and clean (we stayed in the King Suite). Many hotels in Europe can be a bit cramped, so it was a great surprise to see how spacious the rooms were. If deciding whether to get the breakfast, do so! My husband is a meat eater, and I am a vegetarian; however there were many options for the both of us. We will definitely be coming here again when we visit London!",5,2017,12,19
120,"Modern, clean and consistent hotel in London","I've stayed here a few times now, consistently it has been excellent: very fast and friendly check-in, rooms are perfect, staff are really nice, location is great...what more do you need (especially considering some other terrible options from Hilton in London - this is the one to choose).",5,2017,12,18
120,Great! ,"I was there for a short holiday time in London.
Great comfortable hotel, superb breakfast and very kind staff.
The room was super and the hotel location is near the tub station. Tate modern is close to it and there are supermarket and bar there. ",5,2017,12,17
120,Repeated Vists - Fantastic Hotel,"I am in London weekly and find most hotels have a bland and somewhat mechanistic approach to their customers.  But the NOT the Hilton at Bankside.     

The staff are attentive, remember you by name and cannot do enough to help.  They engage you in genuine and sincere conversations and if you visit more than a few times they remember what I like for breakfast etc.  

It may not be the cheapest hotel at full rate, but if you get a good rate - it is well worth the price.   

Close to the Tate Modern a short walk to Borough Market, The Globe and much more...",5,2017,12,17
120,Excellent ..,"Continues to be the best Hotel in London. We are both Diamond members. Great welcome, nice afternoon tea in the lounge. Loverly room. I just don’t understand how the Park Lane Hilton continues to be appalling and yet this one achieves standards of excellence all round. Anyway thank you again for a great stay ...",5,2017,12,17
120,Wow! One of the nicest Hilton’s!,"I was in London for 5 nights for business and it was my first time visiting. Absolutely amazing hotel! I’ve been staying at Hilton properties for years and this has to be the nicest stay I’ve had. The rooms are so spacious and modern with great amenities. If you can upgrade to the executive lounge, do it! It was so great having that as a breakfast option in the morning and I thoroughly enjoyed their evening bar and snacks! The staff was excellent and I was greeted by every member at the desk each time I walked by. Finally the location is perfect for London and so close to everything. I hope I can return to London someday and if I can, would love to stay here again!!",5,2017,12,16
120,Sunday carvery,"We went here as a group of six friends for a Christmas get together. 
We had the 3 course  Sunday Carvery. It was one of the best Sunday meals I have had. The all you can eat starter buffet was varied/fresh and extremely tasty. The main course we all had beef and it was tender and really nice with a lovely fresh Yorkshire pudding and all accompaniments . The the puddings, WOW it was another table of all you can eat, Lots for all tastes, you won’t be left wanting there!! 
All this for a very reasonable price, we will most def be going back soon. A big shout out to Kamal who looked after us and made sure we wanted for nothing. ",5,2017,12,16
120,Beautiful hotel - disappointing bar,"Stayed at Hilton Bankside two days for business. As a frequent visitor to London and a gold member at Hilton I always stay at Hilton Tower Bridge, but wanted to try something else this time. 

Hotel is beautiful, area great and breakfast very good. So I can certainly recommend the hotel. Apart from one major thing. 

The bar was a massive disappointment. Not the staff or the drinks but the bar was crowded every day and the music was so loud. Seemed more or less like a closed party for local companies using it for social events and as a hotel customer I did not at all feel welcome. Only the last day I secured a place at the bar returning from a dinner with clients. 

Maybe the hotel should scale back on outside arrangements and prioritize staying customers a little more at the bar. 

I understand the attraction of being a local scene, but as a paying guest I was quite frustrated due to no access to the bar. For this reason alone I will probably return to Tower Bridge next time. 

But once again - rooms and service otherwise great!",4,2017,12,16
120,A wonderful stay,Weekend away to celebrate my husbands milestone birthday with friends. Everything was perfect from the moment we arrived until departure. Would highly recommend and would most definitely return. An amazing time was had by all. ,5,2017,12,14
120,Fantastic Stay,The staff and service was exceptional.The location is central to the tube and a lovely stroll along the Thames to the tourist attractions. A wonderful pool & spa to relax in after along day of sightseeing.,5,2017,12,14
120,The Staff!!!,"Hi everyone!

I am not one to usually leave reviews, be it good or bad ones but this time I was compelled to leave a review. 

I have now stayed at the Hilton London Bankside twice, once for one week and another for 2 weeks and without a doubt, this is the most pleasurable hotel stay I have ever had. The rooms are impeccable, the staff is amazing and the service is wonderful! 

My mornings were always greeted by the wonderful servers in the dining area and by far, J. Vasquez was the best! He was always so polite and attentive, I never had to ask for a refill on my coffee or juice as he always knew when I needed something extra. He was always so courteous (as the rest of the staff) which really brightened my mood on dreary London mornings. 

The rooms were gorgeous and the cleaning services were excellent!! My room was cleaned daily and always refilled with the necessities. 

I am heading back to London in February for yet another work trip but and I can't wait to stay here once again as it feels like home now. LOL 

This hotel is definitely 5 stars in my book! See you soon Angelo! 

Sasha",5,2017,12,11
120,It was well nice,"In all honesty I thought this hotel was actually really quite lovely, I’m not an interior designer nor do I care for that but the decor was truest lovely to sit in, I had a twin room which was lovely as it meant one bed to chill and eat in while I watched the football and another to sleep in peng really, bt sport on the tv for free #loveit. Another classy point was the speaker in the shower oh my days that was sweeeeet. Only negative, at like half 9 room service walked in my room... I hadn’t ordered anything... otherwise it’s 5 stars unlucky Hilton better luck next time",4,2017,12,11
120,Great Hotel until you need something,"Stayed 4 nights for a little get away with the wife to check out the market and do some shopping. The hotel was very nice until we had small issues, i.e ESPN did not work on our TV asked to get it fixed and it never happened. Lack of plugs on the bathroom wall use a hair dryer. I also had to print sometickets but their guest computers were using internet explorer 7 so no websites working so I could not print my tickets. Apart from the that the hotel was great the staff were friendly and nice. Just don't ask them anything.",3,2017,12,10
120,Absolutely superb.,"Online reviews suggested that Bankside was the best Hilton in London, and our experience only confirms the reality. We loved our stay--the room, the breakfast, the service, the anniversary cake (for our 25th!), and the supportive service at every point. Can't wait until next time!",5,2017,12,09
120,"One of the best Hiltons, attentive staff, great location & food","Very friendly staff and concierge, the executive lodge was top notch - it was a great addition to our trip. Great location, walking distance to many attractions but not crowded and ""touristy"". At times it felt morel like a business hotel and the bar was hopping with young upscale locals. The entrance and lobby were very appealing.",5,2017,12,08
120,Dinning Experience,"Just finished having an amazing dinner at this amazing hotel and just wanted to give great thanks to Roula, who made from our dinner an unforgettable experience due to her excellent service. Big thanks ",5,2017,12,08
120,Great Hilton standards but a bit remote,"Typical Hilton standards throughout the hotel except at breakfast. The hotel is about 10 minutes walk from the nearest tube station (Southwark) and not easy to find and about 20 minutes walk (through quite congested areas) to London Bridge.

The room was a decent size with a nice tv and lots of table space! The bathroom was also large and luxurious with lots of towels and toiletries and a large walk-in shower. Cleanliness was exceptional!

The breakfast was quite limited and not worth £28! The scrambled eggs (and the pancakes?!) were too salty but the omelette was one of the best I’ve ever had. There was also a good selection of cold meats (but not many cheeses), fresh juices, nuts, dried fruit yogurts, pastries and cakes (which looked fresh but were quite hard). I was disappointed that the restaurant was empty and they offered me only 2 choices of seat: either behind the speaker of a a very large group or in the middle of the restaurant next to the clear-up area.

It was quite a busy hotel too so allow time to check in and out!",4,2017,12,08
120,"Great hotel, excellent executive lounge, awesome service","From the extraordinary helpfulness of Suzanna at the front desk, to exceptional attentiveness and helpful advice from Gergely in the executive lounge, the service was exemplary. Because my boyfriend is a Diamond member, we were upgraded to a king executive room, which was spacious and well-appointed with a terrific bathroom, albeit with a terrible/non-existent view in 558. The executive lounge was one of the best I've encountered with a great breakfast, awesome afternoon tea, and good evening snack. I highly recommend this hotel.",5,2017,12,07
120,Excellent hotel in a great location!,"I stayed at the hotel for five nights and would absolutely recommend it. 

The rooms are clean, spacious and modern - they look newly renovated.  The WiFi is good and there is a nice selection of teas in the room. They only have British-style electric outlets (no international power bank), so if you are from elsewhere, bring adaptors. 

This hotel is very close to the Southwark and Waterloo tube stations (approx. 10 min and 15 min walk respectively) but there are a lot of attractions within walking distance. 

The breakfast at the hotel is quite expensive for a regular buffet (25 pounds) but there is a cafe and a grocery store next door. 

The laundry service is good but they use extremely scented products so if you are allergic, I would not recommend it. The fabric softener is a bit too potent...

Overall, a great hotel with polite and helpful staff. I would stay here again. ",5,2017,12,07
120,Excellent Hotel,"This hotel is superb, it was our second visit and we were not disappointed. It is located a short taxi ride from London Bridge and right near the Tate Modern. We forgot just how lovely the hotel was and how welcoming all the staff were. The breakfast is to die for with so much choice and of good quality. We look forward to our next visit in the new year.",5,2017,12,06
120,"Excellent Property, Poor Service","The Bankside is a beautiful hotel in an amazing location.  The business district at the weekend is the perfect getaway for those wanting a more sedate shopping/restaurant experience.  For this the hotel is ideally located.  Entering the revolving door my fiancee and I were greeted with the warm aroma of cinnamon that was filtering through the air con and really made us feel in the Christmas spirit.  At first it appeared after speaking to the chap on the front desk that the staff were very attentive and warm, indeed as a result of my mentioning that it was my partners birthday - that evening we returned to our room with a 'Happy Birthday' dessert in our room without any request.  Which was a lovely touch.

However the remainder of our stay did not live up to the initial impression.  On the first evening the bar staff in the 'Distillery' were very sombre, it wasn't a personable or friendly service.  Further to this when we asked about different options on sloe gins we were presented with a rather gruff showing of bottles, no prices were given, specifically we weren't informed of the extortionate rate of the option we chose.  This led to a bill of £40.00 for two drinks.  A lesson learned by myself perhaps but some measure of customer service might be a consideration.  Breakfast continued the downward trend.  This was chaotic with no clear objective as to seating or the method in which one orders or obtains breakfast.  Again the staff were morose and unsmiling with little time taken to engage the guests in pleasantries, were were eventually sat in what I can only describe as a thoroughfare, so that our elbows were treated to speeding traffic of diners and staff in an attempt to seemingly escape the depressive atmosphere.  People queued for no apparent reason at the buffet and when I asked I was rather sullenly advised that the line was for fried eggs.  I declined and went for scrambled, this option seemingly indistinguishable from the porridge in taste and consistency.

A little disappointed we ventured out for the day, fully expecting that upon our return our mood would be lifted.  We were wrong.  After a confusing moment with a member of staff not knowing how to operate the lift and leaving my partner feeling a little concerned about security and access, there was an event on that evening that no warning had been advised of, that evening as we attempted to sleep we were kept awake by the base line of what sounded like the mixing desk of freight train.  I complained twice but it was only at one am that we finally achieved silence.

Compounding matters when we left the next morning our bill was overcharged without allowing us to review.  Adding breakfast on when we had already paid for this.  No apology was forthcoming....all this occurred as we attempted to leave for a train and while three separate members of staff asked to take my suitcase, clearly there is very little communication as all were within the vicinity of each other.

In short - Stylish but lacking substance.  Would not recommend considering the price and the eventual product.",2,2017,12,05
120,Good hotel for business in London,"Overall, nice hotel in London near the river. Good lounge experience - food & service are good. Hours are also good. Rooms are comfortable and updated. Gym is fairly basic. I'd stay again if in the area. Good bar scene in the lobby",4,2017,12,05
120,Great stay...again,"Genuinely happy to recommend this hotel. I spend many nights in hotels (mainly on business) and a good number of those are Hilton’s. This hotel is my absolute favourite. Great decor (contemporary/boutique, but cosy rather than pretentious), friendly and professional staff, good food, comfortable rooms. The location is ideal too.  This place sets the benchmark for other Hilton hotels, in my opinion.",5,2017,12,04
120,Elegant late night cocktail venue,"Great visit to the Distillery cocktail bar. Knowledgeable staff, interesting cocktails (60 different gins !), fast and friendly service from Liana. The hotel is a short walk to Borough Market, Tate Modern, the Globe and the Millenium Bridge with great views across to St Pauls and down river to Tower Bridge.",5,2017,12,04
120,Always love Oxbo Bankside,"Have been here many times, always enjoy it. Visit Flat Iron, little walk away!     
If dining in, very good soundtrack - not Muzak. Distillery bar cocktails good. Mulled wine and mince pies in lobby at the moment! Has a good gym and proper length pool. Location perfect. Attitude of staff very very good.",5,2017,12,03
120,Hilton standard,"As a Hilton Gold member we booked an executive room with lounge access. The room was spacious, spotless with all the usual Hilton standard facilities. Great breakfast and very good lounge extras. We will return to this hotel on our next London visit.",5,2017,12,02
120,Group bookings and conference rooms,"Dealt with Allen Dsouza for a group booking for 16 people and with Ama Agyeman for a conference set up for 16 people. Both extremely professional and efficient, was always a pleasure to deal with them and they always had time for me and my queries. Both assets to the company.",5,2017,12,01
120,"Comfortable, quiet rooms","The room was of good size, very quiet and the bed was firm. Unfortunately the bedding (pillows, duvet) was filled with down/feather. They were soon replaced.
No minibar as such. A fridge in a drawer with two complimentary bothles of still water. Kettle and instant coffee/tea bags. Two supermarkets next door. ",4,2017,11,30
120,We love this hotel!,"This wasn’t our first visit to this hotel and it won’t be our last. The staff are amazing, the food delicious and the beds super-comfortable. The breakfast is pricey, but the choice is expansive and there are chefs on hand to cook extra options. ",5,2017,11,29
120,Glorious bed - brilliant nights sleep,"Stayed here as part of an awards evening recently, and liked the modern decor and plush interior.  Nice bar downstairs for a really great vodka martini, and extremely friendly service on check in.  The desk set up is good, and the free refreshments in the mini bar a welcome touch.  Best thing was the bed though - with a lovely think duvet and really comfortable enormous bed.  Not a cheap night - but a nice one regardless.  A bath would have made it perfect.  Great location - a 5 minute walk to the Millennium Bridge, and plenty of places nearby for coffee / groceries.",5,2017,11,27
120,Top-notch customer service ,"Stayed 2 nights at this urban feel hotel by the River Thames.  
Short walking distance to Southwark and Waterloo tube 
stations.
Excellent services received from check-in till checkout.
Checked in before noon by Guest Service Manager Jan, she treated us like VIP.  Very knowledgeable concierge Mark, whom gave insightful info on navigating the city. 
Received several text messages from front desk to make sure things are alright.  
There are big umbrella at the lobby for guest use.
Special thanks to Hafdala & Constantine at concierge.  
All these great staff made Hilton London Bankside remarkable, definitely would stay here again when I return to London.  ",5,2017,11,25
120,Very very nice,"Very nice Hotel, distillery bar very good and it's something that you can't find everywhere. Natasha at the check in was super efficient, polite and brilliant. Same thing for the staff of the distillery, can't remember now the names. Only one thing that didn't go so good, at the breakfast it was 11:02 and the waiter us pushed us to finish our breakfast, i understand that you have a shedule that you need to follow up, but let us finish our breakfast without rush, i don't think that we need pressure to remember that breakfast close at 11.00 am. Anyway this little thing will not touch my judgement.",5,2017,11,25
120,Fantastic,My wife and I booked here for the Bottomless Brunch which was most delightful .....We were served by Kamal.... he was very attentive and Exellent throught our stay ....Kamal made our dinning a great experience 10 0ut of 10....,5,2017,11,25
120,Room smelt strongly of damp,"The room smelt of damp which was very strong. I thought that it would be ok sleeping the one night but it actually made me ill, (breathing in damp is not ideal or healthy), and I woke up with a chesty cold.",4,2017,11,24
120,WOW,"WAs invited to attend an industry event at this hotel wasn't really looking forward to it as not a fan of Hiltons...WOW was I impressed with Hilton London Bankside, form arrival to the beautiful wall of plants, check in, my suite the Ex lounge was amazing and service levels perfect",5,2017,11,22
120,Fantastic Stay,"I have just returned from an amazing stay at the Hilton Bankside. It's one of the best hotels in London, a great location, big brand service but a boutique style and friendly service.  The staff could not have been more welcoming and nothing was too much trouble. The pool and gym are excellent as is the executive lounge and restaurant.   My family was made to feel very special and my daughter has already asked for me to book another trip.  Looking forward to my next stay!",5,2017,11,22
120,Amazing Hotel,"I am not easily pleased but I have to say this was one of the best hotels I have stayed more recently in by a country mile. We had booked an executive room with access to the executive suite-amazing! We were there to celebrate our daughters 21st birthday which we had invited 16 of our family to Bottomless Brunch in the Oxbo restaurant. It was fabulous, with both the buffet and sharing platters impressing our guests. The reception staff were so incrediably helpful and we had left stuff in our car that had been valet parked and they very generously retrieved the car back to the hotel for us to unpack it further-amazing!! ~Definitely be back",5,2017,11,20
120,Top Class Hotel ,"This hotel is a real gem. Great location (a stones throw away from the Tate Modern), the hotel is fresh and modern. Very friendly and helpful staff, we were made to feel welcome at every interaction.
The room was modern with the comfiest bed ever! 
Breakfast was top notch, served by polite staff. 
I’ve stayed in a lot of hotels and this was one of the best, I’ll definitely stay there again, thanks for making my wife and I feel so special ",5,2017,11,19
120,Fabulous stay ,"I treated my daughter to a weekend break  here to celebrate her 18th birthday and we also had a university Open day! 
Customer service is exceptional and I have to thank Lenka for being so helpful and making sure all my requests were met.

We arrived very early and hours before check-in, I had booked an executive twin with lounge access, we were offered a room on arrival (this was about 9.30 am,)however I decided to hold out for a higher floor room, I was glad I did as the room had a view of The Shard.
Despite arriving before check in we were given access to the lounge and the pool etc.
We had breakfast, afternoon tea and evening drinks and snacks in the lounge, always a lovely varied selection each day, again staff in the lounge were all superb! 

The room was lovely very comfy beds and a lovely big bathroom. 

Will definitely return to this hotel and would recommend it.

120,suit stay with very comfortable sofa bed!,"this hotel is about a 4 min walk from Soukthwalk tube. next to the Tate Modern and about 20 min walk from the Southbank. excellent location. 

the exec lounge is comfortable with a limited choice canapè. all is very nice. 

the room was excellent and the sofa bed far exceeded my expectations.  the main bed was unbelievably comfortable!  just what you would expect from the Hilton brand. 

the bathroom  was huge with a bath and separate shower. 

the gym is small and has everything you need really. the pool was cold together with the Jacuzzi.  that was disappointing.  

great hotel with very friendly and attentive staff.  Stephanie in the exec lounge was very helpful and friendly. 

I hope all this helps. I would stay again. ",5,2017,11,19

Not possible to have fresh air during the night. And when working at the desk, air was blowing in my neck",1,2017,11,16
120,Horrible Check-in and Guest Services Manager,"The check-in and guest services manager named Anneke were extremely rude and condescending.  As a Gold Member, I was treated as if I were doing them a favor by staying at the hotel.  I was immediately told that I could have access to the Executive Lounge because the hotel was fully booked for a conference.  It wasn't until I asked to speak with the General Manager did Anneke allow me access to the Executive Lounge.  If I ever had to encounter Anneke again at any hotel, I would leave immediately.",2,2017,11,16
120,Couldn't Have Been Happier!,"I was in London for business and decided to try the Hilton Bankside. So glad I did!!! Absolutely stunning little gem in a fantastic location. Right from the get go the attention to detail and the service 5-Star. Very Urban feel.Beautiful fresh flowers everywhere. The rooms are lovely and the beds beyond comfortable. The kind you love to sink into after a long day of work. The duvet was extra fluffy which I totally appreciate. Bathrooms are large for London standards. Nice vanity, huge walk-in shower with good water pressure. Lighting over vanity was not the best but everything else was so nice I can overlook. 
I had access to the executive lounge and it is one of the best I have ever experienced. I received fabulous service every night by an employee that deserves a shout out. His name is Gergely. He always greeted everyone with a salutation. He offered table side service which I appreciated and he does a fabulous job at displaying all of the yummy nibbles. The afternoon tea was filled with little sandwiches and scones and treats. The evenings had a beautiful bar set up and everything from veggies to warm foods. 
The morning breakfast in the restaurant was superb. The restaurant in itself is beautiful. Another shout out to a server names Giota. I appreciate being remembered and made to feel special. She did that every morning even when I didn't sit in her section. 
I had room service 3 nights after work and I was appreciative that the chef accommodated my quirky requests. I never once heard ""We cant do that"". For a hotel to get room service to my door in under 20 minutes deserves a compliment as well.
I had a spa treatment during my stay and was excited to see they offered acupuncture. I gave it a go and was happy I did. I felt great! The also had a facial and I would say it was a 10!
I travel to London every other month and I am happy to say this is my new favorite hotel. I cant wait to come back. 
If you are headed to London for work or pleasure this is a winner!!",5,2017,11,15

120,Great stay at top Hotel!,"Had a great couple of days/nights at Hilton bankside! Really nice rooms, great service and the breakfeast was way better than expected.

You could basically walk to all the big sightseeing locations as long as you don’t mind 30 min extra time of travel, so the location is very good too!",5,2017,11,14
120,Lovely hotel in a great central location,"Really nice hotel. Great rooms, clean and decent size for London. We used the Pool and gym which were also good. Jacuzzi is not heated though, just a section of the pool. The bar downstairs had the most amazing whiskies and the bartender was very knowledgeable.",5,2017,11,14
120,Fantastic stay,"We stayed in the Hilton Bankside for a weekend and we loved it! The service is fantastic, all hotel employees really strive to deliver the best service possible.

Breakfast buffet was excellent with many different choices in (fresh) food available. Location is good, near a tube station but also walking distance to London City. Great!",5,2017,11,14
120,South of the Thames Stay,The Hilton Bankside is an ideal location for those with work to attend to on the southside of the Thames.  It is also well located to be a base for touring London.  Another positive of the location is that it is centrally located that you can walk to a large number of major tourist sites in less than an hour.  And all along the way to your destination are essential London viees.  Local restaurants are also very good and varied within a five minute walk.,5,2017,11,13

Parking on weekends are free after 12-noon with limited spaces, on the day of check- in , £50 will be taken from your account and release a few days later, service charge if you pay for you breakfast before hand  and order room service you be charged £4 a time. Overall experience 8/10",5,2017,11,13

120,Lovely wedding but feels like a rip off,"We stayed last night for a wedding, the hotel, room, food etc was lovely and so it should be for a new Hilton Hotel.

However we feel totally ripped off on prices for a number of things:

Checked in and was told £50 to be taken from card for “incidentals” which would be credited back.
On check out we then find that the money is actually debited (not just held) so for every guest Hilton are taking £50 and holding and then crediting back a couple of days later!!!

Bar prices were frankly disgusting - £11 for a single spirit and mixer with one mixer being poured from a carton of pineapple juice - £5 for a splash of pineapple!!! Plus to add insult the bar automatically adds 12.5% service charge for when you’re going to the bar and getting your own drink - how does that justify any type of service charge - frankly it’s disgusting and has completely put me off visiting a Hilton again - I expect to give a service charge when seated and getting service but visiting the bar myself and 12.5% taken automatically - a member of our group questioned it with the supervisor who was also extremely rude. Where is the 12.5% going ... in Hilton’s pockets 

I also wouldnt expect that charge to be added to a wedding party group when Hilton must have made a tidy profit from the rest of the wedding...

120,Hotel stay at Bankside Hilton,"Great place, wonderful rooms. Parking an issue so prepare to scout around the area as car parks are nearby but can fill up quickly. rooms very comfortable and executive lounge nice although quite small",4,2017,11,12
120,Care Awards in London ,"I stayed overnight with friends to attend an awards ceremony last night. 
Booking, check in and all staff were exceptionally kind and helpful. The room was clean. You can see the staff take pride in their work. This morning my friends and I have had a fabulous breakfast. So much choice from continental to English, fresh bread, pastries, cereals, fresh fruit. My goodness you name it they served it.  My waitress Malika Mahmudova made sure we had everything we needed and was extremely helpful and attentive.  
I hope to stay again.
A big thank you to all the staff you have made my stay very pleasurable.",5,2017,11,11
120,Dull rooms,"Poor executive lounge breakfast, literally no service which was frustrating. 
Did not receive any complimentary water which as I should have. 
Room was very clean but very minimal and not decorative or colourful like the reception or lounge, was quite dissapointing. ",4,2017,11,10
120,Return trip for business,"So pleased to have another course at BSO so I could stay at Bankside again! Warm welcome and swift check in. Our room on the second floor was very spacious, clean and comfortable. Pool a good size for a central hotel. Gym not bad either. Executive lounge was excellent once more and special thanks to Gergely, a lovely, friendly, professional member  of staff who is an asset to the team.
Looking forward to returning in December as a non business guest so I can enjoy the hotel more in a leisurely way.

Hotel very well located. Union St car park close by.
A good nights sleep - didnt hear a thing!",5,2017,11,08
120,"Super Location, Rooms Cleaned Twice a Day, Friendly Staff","The hotel is a one-minute walk from Tate Modern and a 3-minute walk from London Bridge. It took me just 30 minutes to get from London City Airport to the hotel (by public transport). The rooms are beautifully decorated, with a bathroom that includes a rain shower head. The staff was very friendly and helpful. The room was cleaned twice a day. I had a great time here.",5,2017,11,08
120,Loved the Hilton Bankside,I come to this very often and I feel it is located very well. I like the facilities and the staff is great. I come almost every week. I would come back to the hotel as I enjoyed my time. Thank you very much for making my trip so memorable.,5,2017,11,07
120,Great location matched by great facilities and staff,"When we stay over in London we now choose this hotel due to it's great location (>10 minutes walk to Southwark tube and the National theatre) and also it's near to Borough Market. Also the facilities are great - particularly the Exec lounge where breakfast is excellent as are afternoon tea and pre-dinner drinks/ snacks.
The staff are very friendly and helpful as well. 
This trip our only issue was with the turn down service one evening where housekeeping tried to turn down at 16:30 and when asked to come back didn't (she couldn't speak any English and clearly didn't understand the request) but on notifying the front desk on our return from dinner we were supplied with clean towels etc..
This is a great find and lovely to find such a well run hotel in London. We'll be back soon..",5,2017,11,07
120,Great location and staff pity about soundproofing,I booked a couple of nights for a birthday treat for my mum and managed to get a good deal on one of those secret hotel sites. The location of the hotel is very good - very close to the Tate modern within walking distance of the major sites in the South Bank and the rest of London. It is a very modern hotel with a lovely smell in the lobby - the room itself was not very generous although the bathroom was very large and had nice features of speakers to be able to listen to music. The hotel bar was nice with a band playing the night we were in there. The disappointing fact was that on the second night we were there they were hosting a ball - given our room was on the first floor and this was two floors down in the basement the fact we could hear the music until the small hours was not what I would have expected from a new hotel. Overall the staff were very friendly and attentive so if you can get a good deal and a high floor then this is a good hotel for a stay in London.,3,2017,11,06
120,Superb hotel,"Staff and facilities were excellent
A really enjoyable stay 
i would recommend the breakfast selection as a must 
We can’t wait to stay at the hotel again 
So will definitely book here to stay on our return trip ",5,2017,11,06
120,Amazing amazing amazing ,"Wow what a delightful surprise. We went as a group for Sunday lunch and it was fabulous. Great food, great atmosphere with live music and great service. Our waiter Juan Vasquez was so attentive to the children and all staff were Friendly and efficient. Thank you Hilton. Second visit to your facilities in two weeks and you haven’t disappointed. ",5,2017,11,05
120,Great hotel as a Hilton Diamond,"Really liked this hotel, but as a Hilton Diamond, my experience may be squed. Staff were very nice and efficient. Quick check in, on first night they were full, so no upgrade, but clerk checked and assured me she could upgrade me the rest of the trip. As Diamond I received free breakfast in either the lounge or the restaurant.
Room for the first night was a regular room. It was well thought out for the modern traveler, with lots of plum ins and USB charging ports (including bedside). Bathroom was nice with typical Hilton amenities. 
After night 1, I packed up my stuff and left it in the room when I left for the day. I came back and was moved to a 1 bedroom suite. This had a bedroom like my original room, but then had and extra 1/2 bath and a living room. This included free non-alcoholic items from the mini fridge as well. It was way more than I needed, but boy was it nice. 
Location is close to a couple of undergrounds (Southwark being the closest). Easy 15min walk to London bridge. Not the most happening area, but a few things near, and close to train.
Breakfast was good, with made to order eggs/omelettes and good selection of other items. However, it was the same items every day. That's about my only gripe with the place, and if it wasn't one of my benefits, I probably wouldn't have ate there every morning. 
Truly great service personnel at this hotel. I felt like there was nothing they wouldn't do to make sure my stay wasn't great. 
",5,2017,11,03
120,Great hotel!,First time at this hotel in London.  All staff extremely friendly.  You can tell how this hotel trains their staff from the top down.  Excellent restaurant and great food variety in the executive lounge.,5,2017,11,03
120,World's comfiest bed!,"Had a rapid 1 night stay here on a work trip. After a long day at a conference, the Hilton London Bankside was exactly what I needed. Super clean, ultra modern, great service, lovely food. What more could you want?

Highlight - other than the bed, which was AMAZING, the service was top notch. Malika Mahmudova, in particular, was extremely attentive at breakfast time. I was saying to my colleague that I've visited a Hilton in the States and the service there was the best I've ever experienced in a hotel. Well, it seems Hilton invest in keeping that consistent no matter where in the world you stay as the 'feel' from the London Bankside staff was so familiar - hats off to them.

Lowlight - my room, although lovely, was a easy access / disabled room. No bath :-(. Would have been nice to have been informed at check-in or given the choice. The view wasn't a view either. I had access to tiny window with the rest of what you'd have expected to be a window being replaced by a solid wall. Can imagine if you were staying there a little longer then that might become a bit claustrophobic.

Other than that though, everything was perfect. Thanks.",5,2017,11,03
120,Great Hotel Experience,"Professional friendly and helpful staff, good fiid and restaurant service and clean well appointed guest rooms that are ample sized compared to others in London. Beds were very comfortable and no problem with noise.  ",5,2017,11,02
120,Very nice hotel,"We had really nice time in this hotel, very well located and with very nice personnel. We will come again. Special thanks to Mr Dylan Hieu who took good care of us during our breakfasts and to another waiter (don't know his name) who bring to my daughter a small gift box ;-)
",5,2017,11,01
120,Excellent hotel,"Stayed for two nights by myself while attending a conference.

The hotel is excellent, from your always friendly welcome as you walk in right through to the quality of the communal areas and my room I couldn’t fault anything.

Soft drinks and water are provided free of charge from the in room fridge, the bed was large and very comfortable and the whole room was spotless.

Breakfast had an extensive selection of continental and cooked options served in a buffet.",5,2017,11,01
120,Birthday,"Checked in for my bday celebrations with my husband and children. Rooms were hot and stuffy and not at all pleasant to be in. Ordered olives at the bar only the be told 30 mins later there wasn’t any! In all I think this was an unpleasant stay at a London hotel. 

",2,2017,10,30
120,Worth every penny!,"I spent 2 nights at Hilton London Bankside and it was fantastic! It was booked as a birthday treat for my friend, so it was definitely more expensive than I’d usually pay for a city break, but it was definitely worth it. 

From check in, the attentiveness of the staff was evident and did not wane. We stayed in an executive twin with lounge access. 

The room was beautiful and comfortable, with an amazing bathroom. The beds were very comfortable with high quality bedding. The executive lounge was such a treat. I wasn’t really sure what to expect, but I wasn’t disappointed. You can access the lounge which serves drinks and food throughout the day. The staff were fantastic, and one gentleman even brought hot chocolates up to our room for us. 

We ate in the restaurant on the first night from the set menu, which was brilliant value for money (check out the set menus as well as the main menu). The food was delicious. Breakfast is buffet style, although there are lots of staff to help you, cook fresh eggs, and keep you topped up with fresh coffee and juice. 

The spa is independently run, and I booked my friend a massage while I spent time by the pool. The pool area is really tranquil and clean, and the changing rooms are clean with everything you need to shower and get ready after your swim or gym session. 

Overall I had a wonderful weekend, and will hopefully return one day. I wish I could remember people’s names as the staff really did enhance the experience. ",5,2017,10,30
120,Good Service,"The service was excellent, though I must admit the breakfast experience was bit confusing, it was only on the second day we find the meat and cheese. I always liked tomato juice as well but they didn't have any. Rooms were are good.",4,2017,10,30
120,2 Great Nights In London,"We had a great stay at this property!  Traveling with our children so booked 2 rooms-because of our gold status we were upgraded to top floor of hotel and also offered breakfast each day.  Our rooms were wonderful- each had a very comfy couch and equally comfy bed.  We had great views of the area outside and even though the train was near by, the rooms were so quiet.  AC worked great and the entire staff was so helpful.  This was a special occasion trip and when were entered our room their was a beautiful tray of desserts waiting for us.  Location of hotel was excellent, we travel to London often but this was the first time we stayed in this property.  Breakfast was wonderful each day and we ate dinner in the hotel one night and everything was delicious.  Would definately recommend Bankside to anyone who is traveling to London.",5,2017,10,29
120,Excellent hotel,Excellent hotel and great location for anyone doing work in the City.  Lovely staff and for those who have use of the executive lounge Gergely is absolutely charming and attentive.  Really lovely pool.  Steak in the restaurant was exceptional.,5,2017,10,29
120,Great value; great hotel,"I enjoyed my few days stay at this Hilton immensely. It is very well located, particularly for the Tate Modern and Borough Market. The hotel is modern and chic, with the signature comfortable rooms of a Hilton. The staff was superb.

I felt that I was at a top luxury hotel during my stay, like a Four Seasons, the service and amenities were so good. There is a pool but I did not go to it.",5,2017,10,28
120,Quiet nice hotel with great service,"Stayed here for 5 days during my business trip. Although my room didn't have a great view outside, the interior room design was warm and cozy. The staff were friendly and the breakfast was absolutely fabulous! The hotel is located within walking distance to Tower Bridge and London Eye. Really enjoyed my stay!",5,2017,10,27
120,2 Days in London,"Stayed with my wife on the last 2 days of our holiday. Staff in hotel were friendly professional and helpfull. Concierge and Executive Lounge staff were very helpfull and friendly. Ameninities were new clean and modern, funky bar an restaurant. Easy to access from Underground and lots to see and explore around the area.",5,2017,10,27
120,Excellent attention to detail,"Excellent attention to detail, beautiful environment and design.  The staff is amazing and extremely helpful. Most friendly and helpful consierges Spacious room and very comfy bed! Te OXO bar is a great place to enjoy a bespoke cocktail.",5,2017,10,27
120,TLC on steroids!,"What an amazing experience.  Booked the executive room. Got lounge access included which provided breakfast, morning tea, afternoon tea, happy hour and dinner bubbles. Big room great service. Staff who go the extra mile to accommodate all our needs.  Great location close to Tate Modern, Borough Markets, The Shard. Easy access to the central city.  Great place to base yourself for a stay in London. Only caution: many staff do not have English as first language.  Not an issue if you take time to detail your needs",5,2017,10,25
120,Our new favourite!,"We have stayed here 3 times this year, and have had exceptional experiences each time. Rooms are a good size and immaculate. Very comfy bed. Lovely executive lounge with friendly helpful staff- just a shame it’s internal with no windows. Check in/our always easy with lovely staff. Bar is expensive, as you’d probably expect for a Hilton in London.
Plenty on restaurants near by, the globe and Tate are a very short walk, borough market about 10 minutes walk at the most.
Nearest tube- Southwark is about 5 minutes walk. Waterloo is about a 10-15 minutes walk. Convenience stores next door.
The only down side we’ve found is nowhere very close by for a late night drink or takeaway- hotel bar closes at midnight. Just eat have plenty of delivery options if like us, you need something after a night out elsewhere! ",5,2017,10,24
120,"Great hotel , location , friendly staff","Staying for 2 nights 23rd and 24h before our return to Australia . Good location , rooms are nice , and a good exec lounge , with friendly staff . Only downside has been , when we left our room at 11am , with a please make up sign on door and returned at 3pm to rest , room still wasn't made up . We had to make a request for it to be done , and waited in lounge with a request to be notified when complete . No one let us know it was finished . A small inconvenience,  that wouldn't stop us staying again in the future .",4,2017,10,24
120,The best Price and service ,"I have stayed with my wife in a one bedroom deluxe suite with lounge access connected with a king executive room with lounge access for my daughter. 
All the staff of the Hotel from the smallest employee to their high management are so professional, kind, and made us feel at home. 
I have stayed 20 days , there were some mistakes in the beginning but they were all solved and corrected. 
I’m very delighted that I have stayed in this hotel. 
The breakfast was so delicious in the main restaurant and the staff were so friendly. 
The food and drinks in the lounge was tasty and the service was great. 
The Hotel is surrounded by beautiful restaurants , very close to the river Thames ,
Borough market is just in a walking distance along with London eye. 
Finally I recommended this hotel to all my friends and family it’s one of my favourite boutique Hotels , and I hope I’ll come back again every time when I visit my daughter in college. ",5,2017,10,23
120,Superb ,"Got to be said this possibly was one of the best Hilton hotels stayed in - yes location is a little bit “funky” little bit council estate, little bit posh.

Staff are great, would recommend that you upgrade to executive or join the Hilton honours scheme as the Saturday night between 6 and 8 you have complimentary drinks - during the day you also can have access to the lounge (worth looking on website)

Room was massive, plus bathroom was bigger than my own bedroom at home (don’t judge lol)

Can be busy at check in / checkout but have some patience 

Anyway just want to say a big thanks to the team at the hotel - I would recommend you to everyone ",4,2017,10,22
120,"Good service, Room design!","The concierge service of Hilton Bankside is the best I've experienced in  my 15 days travel in the UK. Eddie, warmly welcomed us and helped to take the luggage to the room. The design of the lobby and room is perfect. The negative is there's a bad smell in the bath room, maybe there's something wrong of the sewer. Tate Modern is very close to the hotel and it worth to have a look at it.",4,2017,10,20
120,Excellent hotel,"Stayed here for one night in an Exec Room with lounge access. 

Staff were super friendly, room was large, clean with an amazing bathroom. 

Beds super comfortable and soft drinks were complimentary from minibar. 

The Exec Lounge offered fresh sandwiches and afternoon tea during the day and then complimentary alcoholic beverages and light bites in the evening. Really great value for money. 

Decent wines and branded spirits available; including sparkling wine. 

Location is good. £7-8 in an Uber from Kings Cross. ",5,2017,10,18
120,Odd,"I got back from trip to Europe in September and keep thinking about how odd my stay was at this hotel. By far, this was the most disappointing hotel out of all of the ones I stayed at. The problem? Customer Service. 

Every question I would ask the concierge was met with either badly-hidden judgment or no real answer. 

Great example. I was talking a train to Edinburgh and asked them typically how long it takes to get to the station from the hotel by taxi. They couldn't answer. Then I asked them how early I should arrive at the station to catch the train. Couldn't tell me. Looked at me weird. Said you go to the train station and get on the train.Hmmm....

When I got in the cab, the taxi driver had no problem letting me know to get there 30 min early to catch it. 

I loved the rooms and the services, but don't waste your money on this place unless you never need to ask a question and get a normal, respectful answer. 

All other hotels I went to were fantastic. Only this one has consistently awful customer service.",2,2017,10,16
120,Excellent hotel,"Best UK Hilton experience so far, staff are excellent as are the hotel and facilities, excellent location, breakfast super, the gym is compact but the swimming pool is a great way to wind down, well worth a visit",5,2017,10,14
120," best guess care ","

Spent seven nights at Hilton Bankside , the first three nights were in a corner suite 149 which had large window that made the bedroom brighter. Then I moved to Deluxe​ twin room no 245 which was facing the side street but had large window. Both rooms were very comfortable, modren,well maintained and I believe its one of the largest in London.

This hotel has the best guest services I ever had. I travel a lot and confirm that all hotel staff had the same level of guest service manners starting from the door man to the restaurant waiters. 
Reception staff were very welcoming, understanding and helpful all the time. Same as the concierge.
Although it was my first time to stay at this part of London, I can say its was good experience. Plenty of things you can do In this part of the city. Borough market, Tate modren, Shakespeare's glop and london aye are within walking distance from the hotel. Very nice restaurants spread around that area. Two tupe stations are within walking distance ,Waterloo and southwark.
The oxo resturant server good breakfast. I also had dinner one night. 
The hotel offer a spa,gym and a swimming pool which I didnt use. 

Overall, I give this hotel a salute for its excellent guest service and their
 endeavor to keep the hotel guests happy.

",5,2017,10,14
120,The comfiest bed you will ever sleep in!,"This is my favourite hotel to stay at in London and should set the standard for what all Hiltons are like. In fact, I’d class this more of a Conrad/Waldorf style property rather than a Hilton.

The hotel oozes style before you even step through the doors.  Depending on the time of year, or if there’s any big events in London (i.e. Wimbledon), there will always be a stunning display outside the hotel and in the reception area.  Now we’re getting closer to Christmas, I’m looking forward to seeing what they do this year!

The staff are incredible as well; namely Ana, HJ and Per. They’re always happy to take the time and stop to have a catch-up or to see if there’s anything I need.

The way I sell this hotel to my friends and colleagues is by saying it has the most comfortable bed I’ve ever slept in – which is does, by far. And I’ve slept in quite a few beds!

The bar’s great and the cocktails are excellent. The Executive Lounge is one of the best I’ve been to. Very spacious and comfortable with a nice selection of drinks and a decent spread of food.  You can even have dinner there instead of the restaurant next door.

My one and only request would be to upgrade the ‘do not disturb’ signs because they’re quite light and fly off the door every time you open it!

It is a wonderful hotel. One of the best.  I wish it wasn’t so popular because sometimes I’m priced out of being able to stay there!",5,2017,10,13
120,Loved this hotel!,"Fantastic stay at Hilton Bankside! I cannot say enough about the staff at this location. Always a smile with a good morning, helpful tips, answer any questions you have and happy to do so. If you need anything, they quickly respond. One night I left my purse in the bar (not realizing I had done so) and I awoke to a letter under my door letting me know that they had my purse. Hubby wanted desert one night when we walked back to hotel and the restaurant had already closed (we didn't realize it). When we told the hostess that he wanted a sweet, she seated us and he got his dessert and I had some tea. They were telling us it was no problem and happily served us. In a world where most people are in a hurry and can't give you the time of day, it was a true breath of fresh air! You made London a truly memorable experience. Thank you!",5,2017,10,12
120,Wonderful small Hilton hotel,"The entrance is quite unassuming, but the lobby is filled with helpful hosts.  Excellent Gin bar and fabulous breakfast in the main dining room (a steak house in the evening)
The Ballroom and Meeting rooms are on the lower level and surprisingly spacious for a small hotel.

We had a double occupancy room that was adequate size (411 - no view but very good indirect natural light) with a spacious bathroom and great shower.

Very close to Tate Modern. Not so close to Underground station.",5,2017,10,11
120,Probably the best hotel I have stayed at,"I stayed in the Hilton Bankside hotel for 2 nights.

From previous decades, I have been to many hotels around the world.
But putting everything together (room, service, staff, food and location), I would say your hotel is the best.

It is often the little points that are the most noticeable.
Every member of staff made a point to say hello or good morning, even when they appeared to be very busy.

The hotel layout is very clean and modern.
Service is quick and professional (but happy to talk and give a personal feel).

I had breakfast and dinner twice, the food was great every time.
There is a lot of choice for the breakfast.

As for the room, it is usually the same two items that cause me issues at any hotel, pillows and A/C systems.
Pillows are usually too small or too hard and A/C systems either never work or just very noisy.
These were perfect, I had two excellent nights of sleep.

The view out of the room window were trains & train line, but how often do you continue to look from the window??
One worry I had at the time was the noise from the train(s), but I soon realised that the hotel kept the sound and feel of the trains outside.

London does have a lot of hotels, but I would easily return to this one, time and time again.

Ideal location, only 5 minutes from Tate modern and the Millennium bridge.
And only 10-15 minutes from St Paul's Cathedral, London Eye, Big Ben and Westminster Abbey.",5,2017,10,11
120,Great family stay,"Perfect for the five of us. Pool was good / breakfast very nice and also dinner was excellent. Rooms clean, staff friendly and location very good. I would certainly come back to this hotel again and obviously I do recommend this hotel!",5,2017,10,10
120,Fabulous hotel! ,"This is a beautiful hotel in a great location The bottomless brunch at OXBO was fabulous, lovely food and live music! The hotel staff are fantastic, and our room was lovely and modern. We'll definitely be back! A credit to the Hilton brand! ",5,2017,10,10
120,Perfect ,"Stayed 1 night in an executive king room this hotel is top notch ! In great up and coming area bankside , room was huge with a fabulous bathroom, executive lounge best I've been in afternoon tea from 3/5 drinks inc wine beer prosecco and some spirits from 5 30 / 7 30 and the accompanying food was great as we had been out for lunch didnt need dinner , staff all really friendly hotel smells wonderful , on the map this hotel looks a little out the way that is not the case at all everything is 10/15 mins away me and my husband even walked back to Liverpool Street station took about 25 mins across London Bridge can't wait to go back !! Pool area lovely if there was one thing just missed a sauna or steam room .",5,2017,10,09
120,Exceptional Hotel! ,"As a Hilton Honour Dimond member I have stayed in many hotels, this is probably one of the best! 

Great decor, fantastic rooms and very helpful staff

We stumbled upon the restaurant OXBO which did a fantastic all day bottomless brunch, similar to the sort of thing you'd get in Dubai or Vegas. Excellent buffet at a very good price 

We booked the room a few days out, only 40k HH points for a night which is very good value given the standard of hotel, great Exec lounge as well for members

I can't recommend the hotel highly enough!",5,2017,10,08
120,hilton hot spot,"Excellent stylish  hotel ,spacious rooms , fab bar and friendly staff. 
Great location across the road from Tate and walking distance to Borough Market ,the Globe and London Eye.
Be sure to use the bus which stops by the hotel the route takes you all the way to Covent Garden and London Bridge the other way for only £ 1.50",5,2017,10,08

120,Posh and Comfortable,"Leaving do in the Hiltons was not what I expected.  Drinks 2 for 1 (Happy Hour) and then Dinner in the restaurant.  Staff were very very friendly and helpful, 100% service at all times and made us feel welcome and relaxed.  The hotel was very clean and tidy.",5,2017,10,05
120,Best Hilton I've stayed at,"Sometimes I'm disappointed by Hilton Hotels (eg. Gatwick) but having stayed in probably 10 of them over the past years this one is by far the best I've found. Closest similar hotel is probably the Mondrian. Great bars and restaurants, really clean modern rooms, decent service from staff throughout. Not the cheapest but if you compare to the Waldorf for example, I'd choose this hotel every time.",5,2017,10,05
120,Business trip,All staff were very welcoming and friendly. High standard of cleanliness in all areas if the hotel. Evening meal was superb and there was an excellent selection of food available at breakfast. Would definitely stay again. ,5,2017,10,05
120,Look no farther,"This was an absolutely wonderful hotel. Clean, great rooms and very helpful staff. We were in London for 2 weeks and by far the best hotel we stayed at. The concierge recommendations for dinners were excellent. Loved being able to walk to great locations and the bus stop is close. Cozy beds, beautiful rooms, comfy robes, I can't say enough great things about our stay here. ",5,2017,10,04
120,what a Hilton?,"when you come to a Hilton 5-Star Hotel and you have the Gold Status available, you would expect to take Advantage of your Status. this is the case with most large Hotel Groups, but not with Hilton. Here you to book via Hilton, else you don`t get anything. Furthermore I requested an invoice including the creditory amount for the prepaid Hotel stay. This is not possible. else the room itself was nice, even so not Meeting my 5-star expectation, since it was quite small, but a very nice bathroon!!",2,2017,10,04
120,Everything was great!,"I stayed with a friend while sightseeing in London. We had two very comfy beds. The room is modern, clean. Bathroom is of decent size. The staff was very helpful and quick to respond (had an issue with the TV and they sent someone right up, they also helped with directions).  The hair dryer included is very nice.  Didn't experience any noise issues.  Very close to a Tesco Express.",5,2017,10,03
120,Very good but could be better ,"We stayed here on a weekend as we were using the conference room downstairs. The room was very nice comfy bed and pillows. Small selection of free soft drinks a bonus. 
Was slightly irritated that the coffee wasn't replenished the following day and after I had boiled the kettle was left with no coffee to put in the cup. 
Also the volume of the TV is louder in the bathroom than in the bedroom so expect to do all your singing and dancing in their. 
Bathroom again was superb as you would expect from a 5* establishment. 
Biggest gripe was with their being a swimming pool I expected a sauna or steam room and neither existed. Also the jacuzzi was built into the pool very badly designed because in a jacuzzi the water temperature should be quite hot but it was lukewarm same as the pool temperature. 
Other than a few complaints everything else was great",5,2017,10,03
120,Excellent facilities at Hilton Bankside,"Only stayed the 1 evening, but very well looked after by the staff. We used the Executive Lounge all day on our first day, excellent facility and saved costs as didn't have to hire a room for a meeting with 2 colleagues",5,2017,10,03
120,Great Hotel Great Location,Loved this hotel. Minutes from the Shard  and market. Hotel was just built and the entire property was well decorated with a very cool vibe. The indoor pool is beautiful. It is a great location without the madness.,5,2017,10,02
120,Best Hotel for a Long Time,"My partner and I stay in a lot of hotels in different places, and I must say this place exceeded all expectations. I had read the reviews before so I knew it would be nice but didn't expect the level of service we received. Every member of staff in the hotel was so friendly and welcoming. The food in the restaurant was out of this world, and again the service was impeccable. I was so pleased with our room, the bed was very comfy and the bathroom was beautiful with a very powerful and spacious shower. A nice sized TV in the room in a good place to view from the bed, and wow they actually had plug sockets next to the bed.... both sides - which is a massive plus for people who stay in hotels often and know how rare this is. We ordered breakfast to our room for the morning, and again that was delicious. I am already looking at dates I can stay at this place again and take advantage of the pool and spa facilities. Thank you Hilton Bankside, you made my partners birthday treat (after watching the NFL and having an awful journey back)....... perfect.",5,2017,10,02
120,Luxury in London,"I recently stayed at the Hilton Bankside while my husband was on business and I truly enjoyed my time in the hotel.  

The room:
The bed was large and comfortable with nice bedding and good black out curtains.  The room was quite large by London standards and all of the furniture was chic and modern - it seems to have been designed recently.   The shower was heaven - it was large and included a rain shower and a normal shower - the robes were high quality.  The tv was modern and large and you had the option of having the sound play in the bathroom.  The rooms were quite quiet for a hotel.  Our room was on the 3rd floor and I highly recommend the room we had.

Location:
The location is right across from the Tate Modern.  You can easily walk to the London Bridge (20 minutes), the National Gallery (40 minutes), the Tower (30 minutes) and shopping (40 minutes).  If you want to be in the center of the action, this hotel can feel a bit far, but if you're up for a walk or a taxi, it's great.

The Bar & Room Service:
The hotel bar is great, a lot of cocktail choices, nice staff, nice vibe, cool bar.  We ordered several items from room service, they were all very good and reasonably priced.",4,2017,10,02
120,Great location and beautiful hotel,"We stayed at Hilton London Bankside for three nights in july 2017. We have always stayed at CitizenM a few hundred meters down the road, but wanted to try a new hotel at the same location. And wow! What an upgrade! Just loved every bit of our stay, and the receptionist who welcomed us was a really nice guy, Turned out he was from a place not far away from where we live. He even gave us complimentary beakfast, so kind of him! Keep this man forever! I think his name was Pär. 

The rooms were spacious and the bathroom had good size. Nice interior and a luxury feeling of everything. The location is really good, and we can't find one thing to complain about. Will definitely stay again !",5,2017,10,02
120,Outstanding Service!,"This was our first stay at the Hilton London Bankside and hopefully it will not be our last, from the moment we booked in we found the staff outstanding and helpful at all times, we had a nice spacious room and breakfast was of high quality with so much choice.
Tate Modern is very close and the Southbank Centre is a short walk away by the Thames.
Highly Recommended!",5,2017,10,01
120,Outstanding time at bar,"Skip the restaurant and spend your night with Peter at the bar. Amazing service, recommendations, and entertainment. Had a fantastic time and will definitely come back!  Amazing selection of guns from many regions. ",5,2017,09,29
120,Nice but not wow worthy,"This was a nice hotel I just am not wowed. As a newer build I felt the hotel lacked personality (although smells lovely). When traveling to London I am realizing you either get a rundown room in a more historic building, or a nice clean room that is “cookie cutter”.  It is also in a location that doesn’t bring much to the table, its on “the other side” of the Thames. I suppose for that area it is a great option but for a traveler who has choicesI would recommend a more central location. The downside of being on the east side of the Thames is the tube lines are not as accessible. And with all of the terrorist plots taking place on Thames bridges, I just feel better avoiding when possible.
The rooms are clean, quiet and spacious. 
Room service was where I had my most negative experiences. For example, I had gotten a cocktail on day one of my ten day stay. The cocktail had a couple berries in the drink that I did not consume. Although my room was serviced daily, this empty cocktail glass with the 2 berries remained. Day after day I watched as the mold multiplied. By Day 6 I was almost amused by it and I moved the glass around to every obvious location in my room to see if someone would grab it, to no avail. I wonder if it is still there…
In short, a traveler’s stay would be comfortable at this Hilton but for a tourist, the hotel is a bit inconvenient leading to lengthier tube times or more expensive taxi/uber.",4,2017,09,29
120,Great place to stay,"We were there for vacation and had a great stay. The hotel is close to everything and they have a great bar and restaurant as well. The staff is very helpful. The bed, pillows and blanket were great. Would stay again. ",5,2017,09,28
120,Fantastic location and great executive lounge,"I was here for work we took advantage of the Exec lounge for business meetings. 
Plenty of space to work in a relaxed atmosphere with tea/ coffee and breakfast , lunch and dinner facilities in the lounge. I would highly recommend this hotel if coming for business. 

Also , the hotel would work well for holidays given the location and lovely design of the hotel and rooms. 
",5,2017,09,28
120,It's about getting the little things right ......,"We visited the Hilton Bankside for a multi night business stay - 

Positives - great location with proximity to Borough Markets, Gordon Ramsey's Union St Cafe, close to Soouthwark station which means you can walk or cycle everywhere. 

John the concierge was top notch - personable helpful and knowledgeable. 

Negatives

Total lack of attention to detail. This started when I checked in and continued for the duration of my stay.  I had to ring down multiple times just to have my bags delivered to the room. Our rooms were never serviced properly or consistently two days running. Missing towels, unreplaced shampoos, failure to collect laundry after multiple requests, failure to restock coffee / mini bar items. The list is almost endless. Nothing in itself mind blowingly bad but when you are there for business you don't need this sort of brain damage. 

The last straw for me was I suspect that I may have ended up with food poisoning after having breakfast in the hotel lounge. I can't definitely state that it was the smoked salmon but am of the reasonable belief that this is the case  as I was fine the night before and by midday I was in the throes of full blown gastro. 

Anyway the staff did their best to help us but the whole place needs to massively lift its game before I would ever consider going back and there are a bucket load of hotels in London.  
 ",1,2017,09,28
120,Value for money,"This business hotel is value for money. Offers excellent English and Continental breakfast. Excellent service. Spacious rooms. Also has conference facilities, and is a popular venue for corporate gatherings",5,2017,09,28
120,"Business or pleasure, great location, excellent service provision",Simple fast checkin.  Service provision and room excellent.  Good breakfast choices. Concierge staff were excellent and nothing was too much trouble. Great location to walk to the globe and borough market etc - would recommend and stay here again.,5,2017,09,25
120,If you want to feel special in London,"Having spent 7 days visiting 6 countries in Europe we arrived at the Hilton Bankside in London and greeted like members of the Royal Family (at least how I imagine they would be?)

The hotel is just two years old and the staff are determined to provide the five star rating they have. 

The taxi pulled into the hotel driveway and the doorman removed our cases and guided us to the check in. On route four members of staff greeted us and the check in was fast and very professional. In no time we were in our room greeted by a welcome note from the manager and a plate of fresh fruit. The bellman opened the luggage racks and lifted our luggage onto them and gave us a tour of the rooms amenities. 

Coming from Los Angeles it was refreshing to see the wide range of electrical outlets and the fridge and contents were free :-)

We headed for the hotel bar, greeted by the manager who we soon became friends with. Peter Biro certainly understands hospitality and in no time had our drinks in our hands and Peter enquired if we had booked a table for dinner in the hotel restaurant which we hadn't and in no time we had a table booked with recommendations of what to have. 

The service and standard continued for the next twelve days. 

We had access to the executive lounge which is well worth the extra cost. Free alcoholic drinks from 5.30pm to 7.30 accompanied by a wide range of food many may think was their evening meal. Prawns, smoked salmon, meats and salad plus appetisers and canapés which changed every night. The staff in the Exec Lounge also went the extra mile. Breakfast was an experience as where ever you went Gergely was there to serve you. I am not sure he ever went home as he always seemed to be there. In the evenings Peter the gymnast was there making sure you were taken care of. 

This may all seem hard to believe but there is something else. When they built the hotel the site was inhabited by foxes who became the friends and co- inhabitants with the builders. So today, there are little foxes hidden all over the hotel for guests to spot. There is a quiz designed for children but the adults love it as well. 

So as you can guess I am already planning to be back at this hotel in March for two weeks. Will I see you there?

Don't forget to check out the ozone pool and the spar :-)

",5,2017,09,23
120,Perfect stay - top service,"I stayed for one night, arrived early and check-in was already prepered (as inquired) by the very friendly and helpful staff. Modern furnished spacious room, very functional working desk. Top notch breakfast buffet and excellent service.

If you have business nearby i can only recommend staying here.",5,2017,09,21
120,Nice hotel,"A nice and cheap 5 star hotel, booked a standard room which was pretty large for london standards, location is good with tube and bus for covent garden nearby.
Breakfast complete, staff helpful.
A five star hotel should furnish at least slippers in room.

",4,2017,09,21
120,Nice hotel but can't be trusted,"We use a common travel agency.  By adding an  additional night Hilton Bankside justified this as a ""cancellation"" and ""new reservation"" and thus billed for two nights per night stay.  In my view fraud.    Nice hotel and  location,  but make sure you know what you are doing or the ""guest relations"" will screw you.",1,2017,09,20
120,"Amazing Hotel, lovely staff","I have been staying in this hotel regularly for around 18 months, at least every fortnight. It is the nicest hotel that I have stayed in, in London. The rooms are modern and spotlessly clean, the pool is warm and always quiet, the staff are exceptionally welcoming and helpful. They do the best omelettes for breakfast and the bar is expensive but has a nice atmosphere. Location is fantastic, really close to Borough Market and just round the corner from Southwalk tube and Waterloo. Loads of places to eat nearby.Definitely worth a visit",5,2017,09,20
120,Great Hotel,"I can honestly say that this is one of the best hotels I have stayed at. 

The check in was smooth and well handled even though I had three separate reservations which often can lead to confusion. The room was well designed in a dark modern decor with subtle industrial vibes. The bed was very comfortable. 

We had breakfast included in our rate - and what a treat! Everything was so fresh. Only complaint I can muster is that the croissants tend to be soft and not crispy and flaky. After breakfast we were able to enjoy the pool area - which is very refreshing after a night out in London. 

One evening we dropped down to the bar with a few of our friends are we were served wonderfully. We did not get to try the restaurant but the menu looked really good. 

The hotel is about 5 minute walk from the Southwark underground station and only about 10 minute walking distance from Borough Market. The Tate Modern is literally steps away. 

Everything about this hotel was top notch and it was obvious that the details mattered. For example, the aroma in the lobby is a great touch. Would recommend this hotel to anyone staying in London.",5,2017,09,19
120,Now my favourite London hotel!,"I visit London a lot and have stayed in many different hotels including Hilton, Doubletree, Hampton etc, but now I need search no more when staying in London - this hotel is fantastic! 
From the amazingly friendly and helpful reception staff to the lounge, bar and restaurant staff, everyone was fantastic.
The gin bar is fabulous, the Executive Lounge is very nicely decorated with a great afternoon tea and drinks at certain hours, and the restaurant is also very nicely decorated. The whole place is very pleasing on the eye.
The room was very spacious and comfortable with a good shower/bath.
Breakfast in the restaurant was buffet style but very very good - I had the best omelette I think I've ever tasted on the first morning. The staff in there were also ultra-friendly.
Well done Hilton, you have a beautiful building and have recruited top drawer staff!
I can't wait to go back.
",5,2017,09,18
120,Best Hilton in Town,"Originally was staying here for 2 nights on business and ended up staying 4 nights.....2 on leisure
Why......this hotel is phenomenal. The staff  are out of this world and always have a smile and a "" how are you"" attitude.  The service is superb.....breakfast is to die for and housekeeping are the best I have come across anywhere in the world. 
This hotel has style, class and good old fashioned hospitality. The executive lounge, both facilities and team are a credit to Hilton and OXBO puts the Shard to shame.
If you want quality, Very high standards, but a place that feels like home and us extremely welcoming......then this is the hotel for you.
Thank you Hilton Bankside.....amazing 

Andrew",5,2017,09,18
120,Great New Hilton in London,"We stayed only one night over the last weekend in the Bankside Hilton. The staff was exceptionally friendly and helpful. The rooms and interior of the Hilton is great. For the birthday of my daughter they organized a small cake in the room. The executive club is good but I didn't like the opening times and the restricted time slots serving food and drinks compared to e.g. the Old Town Hilton Prague or Moscow.
I highly recommend the location and hotel and will come back for sure thanks to the staff.",4,2017,09,18
120,All the amenities ,"Excellent hotel located on the south side of the river.  Modern amenities throughout.  Spacious, quiet rooms.  Comfortable bed.  Nice shower.  Room fully equipped.  24 hour gym and pool with large variety of equipment.  Great executive lounge.  Close to tube station and Borough Market.",4,2017,09,17
120,Fabulous hotel in a fabulous location.,"Hilton is a large chain and we always try to stay at their Hampton Inns when we are on the road in the U.S. The reason for this is that the quality is usually excellent and this quality, cleanliness and service is predictable. That's the reason we chose the London Hilton Bankside twice in the past two years. The experience was so good that we will seek to stay here again.",5,2017,09,17
120,"Excellent stay, great location, friendly staff","Stayed here alone Monday-Friday to attend a conference nearby. Staff couldn't be more welcoming. I had a Junior Suite which was very comfortable, nice touch that everything in the mini bar except alcohol was free. 
Made good use of the Executive Lounge where there was a lovely choice of snacks and drinks all day long. 
Location was great for my conference on the Southbank, took me 10-15 mins to walk each day. 
Would definitely return if I was staying in London again.",5,2017,09,16
120,"Great location, very snazzy rooms.",Great location. Great access to borough market and south bank. Rooms are great and contemporary with nice bathrooms and lovely showers. Service was good and efficient. Only negativity would be steepness of bar prices and auto tip!!,5,2017,09,15
120,Excellent hotel,"Stayed here for first time and could not find fault with anything! Room was luxurious, food was great, location perfect but most importantly every single member of staff was very courteous and the breakfast dining experience was superb!",5,2017,09,15
120,A few tips if you are going to stay at this hotel,"Just stayed here, the rooms are very new, this is one of the nicest Hilton's in London.  Wanted to share a few tips with you:
1.  Right down the street near the hotel are a Tesco's and a Sainsbury.  I found it easy to walk to the stores and buy food for my room.  In each room is a nice sized drawer refrigerator that you can store your food in.
2.  Ask for more shampoo and conditioner.  Somehow there was never shampoo or conditioner in the tubes they gave me.  I wondered if the maid service was just giving me the used ones back, or if they did not have them fully filled.  Very strange, just ask them to send you more up to your room.
3.  The power situation in the room is strange.  I had trouble charging my phone and had to take it to the concierge to be charged.  If you turn off the hall light in your room, it cuts all power to the room.  It was very odd and made it hard to recharge.
4.  I had the usual problems in getting the front desk to pick up the phone when you pressed the help line, be ready to call several times and let it ring and ring.  It normally took 10 minutes to get them to answer the phone.
5.  There are lots of employees hanging around downstairs.  Be careful who you ask a question of, normally they just turn you over to the concierege who you have to wait for, and they don't help you.  So rather than waste your time asking them, just go to the concierge.
6.  It was always easy to find a taxi at the front of the hotel.  Note that the doorman likes to say hello to you, but doesn't realize that he should help you find a taxi.
7.  Yes, there is a swimming pool.
This hotel is great if you have things to do on this side of the river.  If you are in London as a tourist, I would recommend that you stay closer to the attractions.",3,2017,09,15
120,Wedding ,We stayed here for my cousins wedding. The rooms were lovely. The decor was great and had all the facilities needed for a great overnight stay. As we were there for a wedding the hotel catered for all of our family. The check-in was very smooth and the receptionists were very friendly and helpful. The showers are great. The breakfasts were also very good with a great selection available.,5,2017,09,13
120,Highly recommend,"A great hotel with wonderful staff! Beautifully designed, great rooms and outstanding food! I would highly recommend this hotel for any occasion although we went for a romantic weekend! The wife was extremely satisfied (with the hotel not me) ",5,2017,09,13
120,Great Staff,"Staff was very friendly. Very modern hotel with great amenities. Located in a quieter section of the city if you want to get away from the hustle and bustle, while still being close to the action. Close to the tube and convenience stores. Walking distance from the Thames.",5,2017,09,13
120,"6 Night stay, bit too posh for me.","I stayed here due to work commitments in London. I stayed for 6 nights and had breakfast delivered to the room every morning by 6 AM due to starting work at 7AM.

I arrived and the check in staff were efficient if a little abrupt. I put that down to English not being their first language to be completely honest. To my surprise even though the room was paid for in advance they wanted to take £300 from my account and keep it on hold for a security deposit. My first response was 'your having a laugh' and after negotiating with the check in staff I got it down to £150. To be honest I understand why they do this but it is a bit naughty as nowhere on my confirmations said this was going to happen. Hilton do need to make that clearer.

Up to the room and It was dark, moody and perfect for what I needed. The A/C was lovely and cold. The room had a rainshower which was used twice a day. Nothing better than a rainshower. Usual Towels, Shampoo etc etc available.

The TV was meh, yes it has sky sports but I dont watch TV but still thought the choice was meh. 

In the hotel they have a gym and swimming pool which I must say are lovely. The swimming pool is one depth throughout and has a whirlpool area which is lovely to relax and chill in.

Personally I wouldn't stay here spending my own money. Its not my style and I felt out of place with the other guests staying. Its definately catered to the wealthy.",3,2017,09,13

120,Very nice hotel but a little out of the way,Nice rooms.  Very clean and updated.  Pool was excellent.  Breakfast was good with good options.  Out of the beat and path.  Would probably stay elsewhere in the future as London traffic made it tough to go 3 to 5 miles from location.  Wifi could have been better.  Didn't upgrade for $10 pounds per day.  Wifi was a little slow and drop from time to time.  Provided umbrellas as it did rain on us 2 out of 8 nights.,5,2017,09,10
120,Great location rooms and value,"For a week end stay it would be hard to beat for quality and value in this location. Walk to Waterloo, Tate modern, National Theatre. Very comfy beds. Quiet. Great bathroom. Fun bar. Efficient reception.",5,2017,09,10
120,Best Hilton I have been to,"If you are looking for a top quality hotel in a nice quiet spot, but still close to everything, then come stay here.

A 5 minute walk (max) from Southwark tube station.

The staff are fantastic and attentive to all your needs, from Front Desk and Concierge through to the staff in the Bar, restaurant and executive lounge.

This is a relatively new hotel and the quality of the rooms reflects this - pure luxury and quality everywhere you look.

I have stayed in many Hilton hotels around the World and this one is now my favourite.

Many thanks for making my stay so great.",5,2017,09,10
120,Best Hilton in London,"I stayed in about 10 Hiltons in London and got really speechless getting to this hotel. I arrived at the hotel (5min walk from the underground station) and did not know where to look: the place is modern, clean and all super designed..One of the first hotels where the staff is present (not short of staff)..It really felt like a 5 star hotel by the quality of its product and its service. I would highly recommend this hotel and I really would like to thank the management team. Your team members truly smile. At last,  I had an amazing service from a reservation agent called Monika Frontczak that helped me to get connecting rooms for me and my friends. She made the whole process smooth (not like your central reservation..) Thank you Bankside..",5,2017,09,07
120,Woderful stay at city centre hotel,"Stayed for 2 nights and very happy with the hotel. We chose the most basic rooms but they were immaculate  comfortable, well equiped, spacious and clean.  Staff were on the whole very helpful and courteous, minor issues with cleaning staff aside.",5,2017,09,07
120,Great option close to Tate Modern,"I'm a Hilton diamond member so got club lounge access but no room upgrade (hotel was fully booked). Having said that the lead in room was very spacious, big comfy bed, everything felt new and fresh and the bathroom was very clean, big and with great water pressure. 

I don't know why people have rated the lounge negatively - I liked it. 
Great food, drinks and service. The only negative I could find was a lack of view.

120,One of the best Hilton's in London,"This is a relatively new Hilton hotel which has a really contemporary design and feel.

120,First class hotel London ,"This hotel looks after its guests in a big way
It is in a great area of Southwark with easy access to the Thames river, the Tate modern and you can travel to the city of London very easy by tube or bus (mind your Oyster card)
St. Paul's cathedral can be reached by walking over the millennium bridge
Go executive level as their high teas are second to none and if you like alcohol it is free at evening mealtime

120,Excellent hotel a short walk from London Waterloo and London Bridge,"I have stayed here with work on a number of occasions now and enjoyed an excellent stay each time. 

The hotel itself is quite new and, as you might therefore expect, everything is shiny and new. The rooms are a very good size and the beds are huge and very comfortable - it can be difficult to get up in the morning!

The bar downstairs is excellent and also has a happy hour too - enjoy!",5,2017,09,06
120,Great Hotel,"Stayed here in a family suite (1 king room and one twin room connected). Fantastic rooms, modern and well kept. I have stayed  in London many times and this is by far the best hotel for the price. Tube station is about a 5 minute walk. I believe if you are a Hilton Honors Member you receive complimentary breakfast (check with hotel) that alone saved me at least $75 day for the four of us. Not a bad thing I can say about this hotel, if you are wavering, don't! It's a great choice!",5,2017,09,06
120,The best hotel Hilton has,"This is the best Hilton I have ever stayed in, and I have stayed in a lot. The staff are the most helpful and knowledgeable and most welcoming 
You have to stay here as it is a new purpose built hotel with large rooms modern features and an executive lounge to die for. The executive lounge has the best food and facilities and size to people ratio, no scrambling to get a seat
Situated right behind Tate Modern walks on the waterfront are a great way to relax in an evening away from the noise of the cars and buses of London ",5,2017,09,06

120,Comfortable hotel in a good location for vacation travellers.,"We stayed in an Executive Room at the hotel for a week in August.  All aspects of our stay were excellent.

The Executive Lounge offers drinks and snacks in the afternoon and evening. 
 Highly recommended.",5,2017,09,05
120,Mini break,"We have just spent three nights at Hilton Bankside London.

120,Top Hotel,"I have booked the Hilton London Bankside for numerous meetings and events over the past 6 months as well as accommodation. I have always been impressed by the service at the hotel, every employee I have encountered has always provided a warm welcome and assisted wherever possible. The hotel has been well designed and furnished with its own unique character. It is located very close to the river Thames and Tate museum and is well positioned for access to the rest of London either by utilising the hotel bikes (free to use and made from bamboo), local buses or tube. The restaurant OXBO provides an excellent breakfast with a wide selection available including fresh juices and pancakes / omelettes to order. The restaurant is also a good option for lunch and dinner, they do a great lemon tart. The Distillery bar has happy hour from 5pm - 7pm. There is a decent sized swimming pool and gym in the lower basement although no sauna / steam room (maybe that is in the pipeline?). All the meeting rooms are well equipped and set up professionally with a dedicated team available to assist. The property has a large ballroom able to accommodate over 500 people - you wouldn't expect this when entering the hotel. The executive lounge is a great benefit if you have status or book into the room with access providing afternoon tea and cakes, dinner snacks and open bar in the evening as well as breakfast in the morning if you wish although I would recommend breakfast in OXBO if you have breakfast included as there is a larger selection available. All the rooms are well appointed which you will have no problem getting to sleep in, the bathrooms also have a great rain shower and nice toiletries. I have always rated the hotel very highly and would recommend it is a place to stay or hold events. 

Ps. The Lemon tart at OXBO is excellent and should be readded to the menu",5,2017,09,01

There is a very good executive lounge and the restaurant provides a great breakfast and an excellent evening meal.

The only downside is that as a diamond member I do not find that the staff at the hotel provide much recognition and room upgrades tend to be unavailable, which is unusual for diamond status members. ",4,2017,08,30
120,Excellent Room & Food & Pool - what more is needed!,"Spent 4 nights here and had an absolutely perfect stay.  The room is a nice size (still smallish by US standards, but larger than typical Euro standards) and the bed is very, very comfortable. The in-room fridge has complimentary water and soft drinks which the staff were happy to stock daily with sugar-free soda (which wasn't a standard upon arrival.)  After a 10 hour flight arrived at 10:30 am and was not only given my room, but also offered access to breakfast (which was complimentary for my stay, but certainly not expected on the day of arrival).  I was very impressed with this level of welcome and service!  The room is well laid out with efficient use of 2 closets (fyi...the safe is hiding behind the first closet near the door) and the bathroom is absolutely gorgeous.  An oversized step-up shower with rainshower and hand-held sprayers.  Excellent lighting and mirrors.  There is a warm and relaxing pool on the lower level along with a decent gym.  The breakfast buffet holds many choices and is quite excellent.  When booking your room make sure you have it included in your stay.....you will not be disappointed!  The location is absolutely perfect for easy walks to restaurants, shops and Waterloo station.  I will definitely return to this Hilton in the future.  It is a well managed property that knows how to execute on customer service.",5,2017,08,30
120,Fabulous Hotel,Amazing experience.. The rooms are spacious and so comfortable. The swimming pool is lovely and the service is exquisite. Very highly recommended. So many touches - too many to mention.   What's not to like?,5,2017,08,29
120,Brilliant base for a weekend away,"Hotel was welcoming and only 3 mins from the station. The facilities were modern, staff knowledgeable and had a lovely premium feel. Food was great with the executive package - definitely recommend the upgrade! Thank you Hilton! We'll be back!",5,2017,08,29
120,Best Stay,We really enjoyed our stay which was for my husbands 30th birthday. The hotel is in a really good location and just a short walk from London Bridge. We have been to London many times and the rooms are a great size.,5,2017,08,29
120,Wonderful hotel close to the Tate Modern,"Clean modern rooms, wonderful staff and a great executive level lounge in a part of London that not many focus on staying in. Walking distance to Waterloo station and across the street from the Tate Modern I highly recommend this quite and beautiful hotel.",5,2017,08,29
120,"Beautiful Hotel, Excellent Staff","Beautiful, modern hotel.  The staff here are excellent and really do go above and beyond to help.  The rooms are a good size (even more so for a London hotel!).  The restaurant is fabulous for breakfast, and the restaurant manager is lovely - he remembered us from our first stay and came to talk on our second stay.  The executive lounge area is one of the best I've seen, and is out of the way from the rest of the hotel guests; it's very peaceful.  Definitely recommend this hotel for a London stay - it's in a good location for all the main attractions, but it's worth staying here, even if you'd have to travel a bit further to go to the place(s) you were in London for.",5,2017,08,29
120,Great weekend,"2nd time we have stayed here. A really nice hotel, lovely staff and great bedroom. We stayed in the executive room which includes the exec lounge with breakfast, tea and evening drinks included. A really good USP, will return 
",5,2017,08,29
120,Excellence Personified! ,"Arrived Sunday 27th August for a two night stay. This hotel is divine! They've really gone above and beyond in the service, the look of the hotel and the little touches. Check out the 'foxes' in the fine detail everywhere! We arrived much earlier than our check in and wanted to dress up for Sunday lunch here as it was our silver wedding anniversary. The staff ensured we were  ensconced in a room by 2pm. We had dinner in the restaurant and received excellent attention from Kamal the maitre d, who was attentive and ensured we had a special day. In fact he offered the same service at breakfast the next morning. 

The Sunday lunch was brilliant value for money. At £42 for a three course meal with as much starter and dessert you wanted along with a continuous supply of prosecco in what could only be explained as 5 star grade dining. The breakfast buffet and hot food and service was excellent. We stayed right to the end of breakfast and saw the staff work to such a high standard to efficiently clear stuff away. The calibre of staff here is excellent. They seem super engaged. Management obviously know what they're doing. 

Our room was very quiet even though it was buzzing downstairs. Very stylish decor in the room and throughout. Again beautiful. 

The hotel is situated just across the road from the Tate Modern so we were able to spend a leisurely time there and walk on the waterfront to the Globe Theatre and other bars and restaurants and Borough Market. 

I can't fault this hotel at all and am looking forward to returning in the near future. Brilliant! ",5,2017,08,28
120,We loved it!,"Really nice hotel in great location on South Bank, literally just around the corner from Tate Modern. The decor is really contemporary cool and upscale, our room was good sized and the service was exceptionally friendly and professional.

We opted for an executive room which gave access to the fantastic Executive Lounge! Very calm and cool lounge with good breakfast, great afternoon tea and slightly disappointing hors d'oeuvres. What was odd, was that they stopped serving alcohol at 8pm - something we have never experienced in an Executive Lounge before. 

As value for money, The Hilton Bankside is probably the best we've experienced in London.",5,2017,08,28
120,Best Hilton I've ever stayed in!,"Everything about this hotel is excellent, it's modern, a short walk to Southwark tube station, it's clean, the rooms are spacious, staff are friendly and helpful and the breakfast is probably one of the best out of all the hotels I've stayed in!

Definitely recommend :) ",5,2017,08,28
120,Great hotel but they struggle,"Always a great experience at this hotel, but they need to try a bit harder on the little things if they want to make a truly great impression.  See pic.  :).    As a Diamond the exec lounge is one of the best. ",3,2017,08,28
120,Best Hilton in London!,"We decided to try it out for a 'staycation'. Although it is a little further from the tourist attractions as a lot of other Hilton properties this relative isolation results in a modern, brand new and brilliant hotel!

We were upgraded to a suite which was large and well appointed although it could perhaps have done with more light. The bathroom had a large wall in shower but no bath. The decor was light wood and anthracite brick which worked well. The air con also worked well.

The Exec lounge is large and a very comfortable place to spend an hour. The food and drink selection are excellent and the wine at happy hour is actually drinkable!

We were offered breakfast in the Exec lounge or the main restaurant so we had a look at both. The main restaurant is large but the staff are brilliant and they have chefs working from a pass so you can ask them for anything. There were really nice touches such as the plates being earthenware rather than just white China and the glasses for juice were big!!! At last a hotel who has proper sized glasses for juice in the morning!! The Exec lounge restaurant breakfast was good with a nice selection of hot and cold food. However, as it is next door to the restaurant (it shares a wall)  would opt for the main restaurant.

There is valet parking which we used. The staff are really friendly so this is without doubt the best Hilton in London if you can cope with being slightly off the main tourist drag!
",5,2017,08,27
120,Excellent hotel ,"Visited this hotel again as I do regularly for work. Nice atmosphere, friendly personnel and great service. Comfortable rooms with bathrobes, slippers, good bed and great shower. Can recommend it to everybody looking for a hotel in this price range.",5,2017,08,26
120,Great Choice!,"Exceeded our expectations for a hotel in Europe. Breakfast was included and excellent. Rooms spacious, clean, modern,and quiet. Staff courteous and helpful. Location convenient to all tourist attractions and to the trains.Would stay here again.",5,2017,08,26
120,Enjoyable stay,"We had a very nice three night stay at the Hilton London Bankside in June 2017.  The room was spacious, modern, and clean.  Having a standup shower and a tub with a shower in the bathroom made getting ready easy and quick for the two of us.  Each evening we returned to the room to find the bed turned down and slippers laid out.  Quite fancy!  The breakfast was fantastic, as were the individuals minding the breakfast bar.  Swiss Air misplaced one of our bags throughout the duration of the stay and the concierge desk went above and beyond to call the airline multiple times a day until the bag was located, then worked with us and the airline to ensure it was delivered at our next destination.  

The location of this hotel is great as well.  Easy access to the tube as well as a relatively short walk north of the river.  Most importantly, about a block from a Wagamama.  

All in all a wonderful experience.",5,2017,08,25
120,Fantastic service and location but please put markers in the pool!,"Unbeatable location in London, in walking distance of many attractions and near the Jubilee line.  Service was exceptional overall and the room was quite good.

My only suggestions would be to include some sort of markings in the pool as it is very dangerous for those of us swimming laps to not know where the lane ends.  In addition, compared to the Canary Wharf and Tower Bridge locations, I must note that the executive lounge here was a bit lacking in the food options.",4,2017,08,24
120,A wonderful find just meters away from the Tate Modern,"The hotel itself was well appointed. The rooms were clean, comfortable, roomy and stylish. The staff was helpful and gracious. The hotel is relatively new so everything shines and feels warm and inviting. We had the buffet breakfast which had a large selection of foods that were well prepared. We loved the location as it was a short distance to the Tate Modern and the Thames with some enjoyable pubs and restaurants nearby.",5,2017,08,24
120,Nice hotel,"Stayed here for 2 nights and was very pleased. 
Room was great 2 very large single beds, mini bar, brilliant walk in shower, bath robes and slippers, good to channels, turn down service. 
Breakfast was average, not much choice. 
5 minute walk to Southwark tube station. 
I would return. ",4,2017,08,24
120,Fantastic hotel with great staff and the best executive lounge,"A lovely new hotel (around 12 months old) all amenities including the best executive club of any Hilton property I have stayed in around the world.  Executive  room is large and modern with trendy bathroom with concrete floor in shower.  The staff here are great, we needed to extend our stay and Chiara at reception arranged the extra days and gave us a great rate too.  In the amazing executive lounge there is everything you could wish for including cocktails from 5pm til 8pm.  Gergely in the executive lounge went above and beyond with his service bringing me chamomile tea when I was coughing and welcoming us each day with a warm hello and a coffee, Qusara also worked in the lounge and helped me report my missing phone.  I cannot speak highly enough of the staff",5,2017,08,23
120,Great stay,"Great stay within easy access to London, hotel is so clean and welcoming. Staff are extremely helpful and made you feel like nothing was too much trouble the way it should be. Rooms are spacious, comfortable and quiet.",5,2017,08,22
120,Would definitely going back!,"From the eclectic ultra chic and modern reception area with the super kind multi- national staff, to the modern and (surprisingly) spacious room accommodations and  delicious meals in the restaurant,  we truly enjoyed our stay at the Bankside. The only caveat was that we stayed after a family that, uh, left a pretty strong --- aroma shall we say that took about 2 days (!!!) to dissipate. Alas, we liked our rooms so much that we didn't make a stink of it (pun intended!). Seriously,  the hotel is very nice throughout and very close to the Underground with quick and easy access to many local attractions. Definitely would go back!",5,2017,08,22
120,Great oaxkage,"Location is superb for connection to underground and buses.

Indoor swimming pool is great to relax after a long day. 
Room sizes are good and staff is well trained.

Breakfast spread is good too but there is a Costa next door in case you want something quick for the road",5,2017,08,21
120,Wedding reception guests beware to be ripped off.,"Was a guest at a wedding here over the weekend. Food was excellent, the reception room was excellent and the facilities were excellent. Please beware though as the bar prices are frankly ridiculous. You always expect hotel receptions to be on the pricey side however £11 for a vodka and coke is simply robbery. They were not measured out either just free poured.  If you want to have a few drinks as most do at a wedding, best call your mortgage provider and let them know that you will be defaulting. BOTTLE of beer, not a pint,  £8??? Do me a favour. They were not even in a fridge, just an ice bucket, so I had a couple of warmish ones. When you pay £8 you expect it to be perfect. 

To add insult to poverty, there is a £12.5% service charge added to every transaction, so that bottle of Peroni now comes in at £9.  How on earth can you justify adding a service charge when you que up at the bar and get it yourself? Is that money going to the hotel or the barman because if it is the barman getting a quid for simply taking the cap off of a bottle of beer, then where do I apply? Please reconsider the service charge as it is money for nothing. Also as it is a cash only bar, you do not realise you are having your pants pulled down as you do not get a receipt. 

The bride and groom put £500 behind the bar so everyone could have a drink and it didn't stretch far enough. Whole evening left everyone feeling robbed.",2,2017,08,21
120,Great value and location ,"Stayed 2 nights at the Hilton Bankside after reading the Trip Advisor reviews and comparing hotel rates. It's accessible from the underground Southpark stop with an elevator. It's location is walkable to the London Eye, St Paul's Cathedral where the tour bus Hop On Hop Off has a pick up, and though a longer walk to Trafalgar Square and Leicester Square for the discounted theatre shows. The hotel room is spacious, the bed, pillows and linens are comfortable, and the breakfast buffet is great. Stayed at room 206 which is quiet and room has good quality supplies of toiletries. Reception staff are friendly and helpful.",5,2017,08,20
120,A Pleasant Stay (and a pool),"This review is based on a six night stay in August 2017.  We chose the London Hilton Bankside because it was close to the Globe, had a pool, and was highly rated. It did not disappoint.  The building was barely two blocks from the Tate Modern, within easy walking distance of the Globe and many restaurants, and only three blocks from the Southwark tube station. The lobby was  clean and tastefully decorated. Both the bedroom and the bathroom were spacious and well-appointed. The bedding was the most comfortable we have encountered in any hotel. The pool clean, well-lit and well-maintained. However, highest praise goes to the staff -- particularly the concierges (all three I dealt with proved highly knowledgeable) -- for their attentiveness, efficiency and speed of response.",5,2017,08,20
120,Hotel for our stay in London with grandchildren,"In advance of our trip to Scotland and London with our 2 14 year old grandchildren we had reserved 2 rooms at the Hilton London Bankside. We were traveling from Scotland to Heathrow and decided to take the Underground to the hotel. Southwark station is within 5 minutes walking from the hotel and even with our suitcases and carryon items it didn’t pose a problem. Upon entering the hotel we were warmly greeted by a bellman who wanted to take our bags for us. I preferred to check in first and then take our baggage to the rooms. Both rooms were ready for us and despite asking in advance for adjoining rooms, our rooms were across the hall from each other. Upon seeing the rooms, I knew that we had made a great choice. The room was beautiful, neat and very spacious. The bathroom was exceptionally appointed and my grandson loved the waterfall shower!. My wife and I took advantage of the happy hour at “The Distillery” a gin focused bar off the lobby. A very relaxing spot after a day of travel. The teens were not keen on going out for a meal and we used the room service available on a 24 hour basis. Very quick service and a nice meal in the room! Due to the central location of the hotel to there South Bank sights we found it very easy to get around. Underground stations were a short walk and the overall transit system was first rate. The hotel concierge was most professional and helpful and I utilized his services often. We had booked the room as a B&B and were not at all sorry for that decision. I don’t ever remember seeing so many different things available including pancakes, waffles, omelets and eggs to order along with every fruit, sweets- on and on. If you decide to stay here, the B&B option is well worth the extra money. Both Teens are fairly picky eaters but the found more than enough to fill them up to start the day. My only disappointment was a meal that we ate at the OXBO Restaurant. The facility is beautiful, unfortunately the service was super slow and the food was only so-so. Hope that they improve in the future. I would definitely stay in this hotel if I ever come back to London and suggest it highly.",5,2017,08,20
120,A credit to the Hilton brand,"We had an excellent one night stay at the Hilton London Bankside.  The beds were very comfortable, and featured the best hotel duvets I've ever come across.  The free in room soft drinks are a great idea and more hotels should do this.  The decor is understated and minimalist - very on trend!  Great bathroom, fantastic toiletries.  Absolutely loved the room.

The staff are exceptional, from the doormen to the receptionists to the bar staff.  From the moment you arrive, you are treated like a 5* guest.  Everyone we spoke to provided exceptional customer service.

The local area has some great restaurants if you want to venture out, although we ate in the bar and had a great meal.  Breakfast was good, but I'm not sure it was worth £20 each.  You can get a much better breakfast in the Refinery restaurant across the road to be honest.  This was the only negative from my stay.  

Of course the Tate Modern is practically next door so a visit is a must.  You've also got the South Bank just steps away, and it's a short tube ride to all the tourist attractions or shopping you could need, although I recommend just taking a walk across the river to see what you can find.

I will definitely be visiting again.",4,2017,08,20
120,excellent location,Very comfortable and convenient place to stay. Fridge and tea pot and stores nearby. You can walk from here to all sites. The pool is so relaxing. We were very happy to stay here. It is a trendy neighborhood.,5,2017,08,20
120,Excellent Location for Exploring Bankside,"This is a comfortable hotel staffed by a friendly and professional team.  The room was well designed with good facilities.  The bathroom had an excellent walk-in shower and plenty of shelf space to set out toiletries.  Just set back from Southwark Street, it is ideal for visiting the Menier Theatre, Tate Modern and Borough Market.",5,2017,08,20
120,"Great hotel – Modern, new, excellent service","I stayed at this property for one night while passing through town.  In summary, it is a great hotel and I would definitely book it again.  Some more details…

Pros: Modern, clean, free Wi-Fi, above average breakfast (free with status), free minibar with status, air conditioning that worked well, spacious rooms (I was upgraded to a “King deluxe”) and comfortable beds.  Furthermore, the service was pretty good.

Cons:  None really worth mentioning.  One possible downside could be the location – the property is behind the Tate Modern, close to Southwark Station, which is a little out of the way.  That being said, it’s only a quick tube trip / cab journey / walk to a lot of the tourist sites.",5,2017,08,20
120,High marks for service and location,Enjoyed our stay here.  The rooms were a bit cramped but no other issues.   The front desk and other staff were exceptional.   Plenty of restaurants and shops in walking distance.   The hotel bar was fun for late night.   Hope to come back. ,4,2017,08,19
120,Great hotel,"Only stayed for 1 night, but the hotel was great. We had a suite which had plenty of space for 3 people. Breakfast offered a great selection. Very cool lobby area. Would have liked it if the windows were bigger, a bit more like hotels in NYC. ",5,2017,08,18
120,Great location EXECELLENT SERVICE Fabulous food ,"We stayed 4 nights at this hilton wish I could have stayed longer from the moment we arrived we were greeted by the smiling face of Isabel , she was charming accommodating went out of her way to help us sort out our stay all from a front desk ! We were trying to add a night stay she had her manager Alex help out he was the second person we met yet again another amazing experience. He was able to accommodate our parents room close to ours even though they would be arriving a day later. 
The rooms the lobby and every employee we came across were simply lovely ! Not sure what their secret is but the hotel lobby smells gorgeous ! 
Our room was spotless comfortable and luxurious. We were a walk away from almost everything we wanted to see.
When we return to London we will stay at this HILTON !
Btw they offer excellent breakfast ❤️",5,2017,08,18
120,Where service is kind,"A family vacation with an 80-year old, disabled Mum could be difficult.  The Hilton Bankside in London made it so much easier, with thoughtful, kind service - from doormen helping her into taxis, providing a room with accessible shower and providing a wheelchair in the hotel. We mentioned we had visited at this time to celebrate my Mum's birthday and they sent a gorgeous cake, decorated with 'Happy 80th, Marie-Claire'. Bravo Hilton Bankside.",5,2017,08,18
120,1 night in a very comfortable room,"Booked using hilton rewards to stay in a deluxe executive room. Upon arrival was upgraded to a 1 bed suite. This was a great room with large bed, separate lounge area and large shower. Free soft drinks and snacks. Room was very quiet and on 3rd floor.
Breakfast was in executive lounge and was adequate, choice of scrambled eggs, bacon and sausage or pastries and cereals, toast and juice.
Free wifi as standard or free faster wifi as a gold member. An evening drink in gin bar was pleasant with complimentary poopcorn and crisps, although glass did have small chip in it and 2 G&T (simple bombay sapphire gin) came to £26 which is v expensive IMO.",5,2017,08,16
120,Beautiful hotel... disappointing stay,"Stayed here Saturday night for a wedding held in the Hotel. I paid a £170 (discounted rate due to group booking) for a room with a King bed.... only to find two twin-beds joined together! so when 2 people sleep in it a dip appears in the middle. very un-comfy. Hotel staff disagree and their argument is 'when we look at it there is nothing wrong with it and the mattresses are only 6 months old... had they had to sleep in it maybe their view would be different, visually of course it is fine.

Breakfast - told by staff to 'hurry up as we have a group booking coming and need to tidy up. This was at 11:02, despite breakfast being served until 11am. ruined breakfast for us...despite complaining no real satisfactory response.

Hilton response below acceptable standard, expected a lot more, especially considering i am a Hilton Honors member",2,2017,08,15
120,Excellent hotel,"Extremely satisfied with our stay, staff were professional and helpful. Location was perfect, close to underground, Borough Market and lots of eateries to chose from. In future visits this hotel will be at the top of my list. ",5,2017,08,14
120,Superb Hotel,"A great part of the Hilton network , made to feel welcome on each visit, the lounge and bar are great places to hang out and staff are excellent.  We will makes sure to visit this hotel again in the near future",5,2017,08,11
120,Amazing experience,"I visited Hilton London Bankside on March 2016 to write a review for a magazine I worked for at that time.

It was a really nice experience! The staff was kind and welcoming! 

In the first night we booked a dinner in the restaurant of the hotel. We arrived late but they served us anyway and all the staff made sure that we felt comfortable and welcomed.

The food was amazing! 

The bedroom was really comfortable, with an industrial modern decor.

In the morning we had breakfast with the PR - really nice girl!! - and she made us a tour for TVE entire hotel. 

The breakfast was really delicious and with a lot of variety! 

I hope to visit this hotel in my next trip to London!!",5,2017,08,11
120,Favourite Hilton in London ,This is my fourth stay at Hilton Bankside and this is my favourite hotel in the Hilton group other than the Conrad.  It is a very different concept to the usual Hilton and the decor and facilities are to a very high standard.  The bar and restaurant are also excellent and I always seem to go out for a walk to find somewhere to eat and have a drink and come back here.  The breakfast is superb with great choice and quality.  The rooms are very clean and spacious with lovely bathrooms and comfy beds.  I will keep coming back here as my Hilton hotel of choice when staying in this part of London.,5,2017,08,10
120,best Hilton Hotel in London,"great Hotel, great roomsize - very clean and mordern furniture. great Location - 15mins walk to TowerBridge, 15mins walk to Westminster/Big Ben, 5mins walk Southwark Station. great Staff - very helpful and attentively really good breakfast selection",5,2017,08,10
120,The Best Hilton in London,"Pro-active service from the moment of arrival is always a good start & here didn’t disappoint. The style & decor within is a pleasant & very welcome too - fresh, modern & trendy. Perfect. The rooms are just the same - perfectly formed, fresh & modern. One niggle is no espresso machine in the Deluxe Rooms - well, nothing is perfect! The Executive Lounge is a haven for a civilised drink & the breakfast in the main restaurant is a real cut above the usual Hilton scrum. A gem, but please Hilton Management, do keep up the standards!!",5,2017,08,10
120,Another lovely stay,"I love staying at the Bankside. We were going to the athletics, so the jubilee line was perfect - but it's always handy to get around. From the welcoming front door staff and reception staff, I always feel relaxed as soon as I arrive. Had a great king suite this time - 619, which was a different layout to what we've had before - a corridor, with separate living area, en site sleeping area, and second wc, plenty of light from a lot windows. Exec lounge is always a pleasure with good range of drinks, and tasty snacks. Breakfast has a great selection, and we enjoyed the made-to-order eggs and pancakes. We both slept really well, better than I tend to in other hotels. 
Can wait for my next stay in September ",5,2017,08,09
120,Perfect location next to Borough Market,"Great hotel with large lobby, friendly staff and beautiful well planned out rooms. I really appreciated in the rooms how there was a large fridge provided, without minibar items, that you could use to store wine or whatever else you wished to take back to the room. I slept wonderfully at this hotel. The bath was beautiful, really deep and filled very quickly. All in all, very impressed with the hotel. Its about 5 minutes walk from Borough market, one of our favourite places in the city and its located right behind Tate Modern.  The only small thing is that we were on our honeymoon and nothing small was done to acknowledge that. This isn't required but its a test of a truly great luxury hotel to make these efforts.   You'll have a wonderful stay here though, we certainly did, and we were very appreciative of them offering us the same category room with a bath (as requested when booking), as I absolutely love baths and cant have them at home.",5,2017,08,09
120,Best Hilton,"We stay at Hilton Bankside regularly and is our hotel of choice for our London stays.
Staff are fantastic and go out of their way to make sure you are comfortable.
Breakfast is great with good quality foods and lots of choice, we love their Granola.
Rooms are modern and well equipped with very comfortable beds.
Very convenient location a few minutes walk from Waterloo bridge.
I highly recommend Hilton Bankside if you are looking for a good quality hotel with great service.
We look forward to returning again very soon",5,2017,08,09
120,Wonderful Hotel,"Stayed for 2 nights ....booked this hotel because of direct tube (10mins) to O2 but still close Imperial War museum and Tate modern.The price at the time was better than other Hiltons too.
It's not a Hilton that springs to mind when staying in London.
If you look at it online it has a modern look not grand like some of the other Hilton hotels ... but don't be deceived ..from the warm welcome at reception all the staff during our stay were fantastic the decor,rooms and facilities were fantastic.
(Book an executive room if you can,the lounge and other perks was worth every penny extra)

",5,2017,08,09
120,Weekend with mum,"This hotel is close to the Shard and great location for local restaurants and pubs at reasonable prices. 

Easy to teach from Shoreditch tube and rooms were very spacious.

We had an executive twin on 7th floor and the bathroom was huge and very trendy. Seperate seating area from sleeping area. Highly recommended ",5,2017,08,09
120,Very nice hotel with great location and staff.,"Excellent Hotel. Location is great for walking to many attractions.The room had everything we needed and the Executive Lounge provided great value for our family. Staff was extremely helpful, especially the concierges, Mark and Leo.",5,2017,08,09
120,Great 2 Night Stay,"Great hotel in a fantastic location, quiet but within easy reach of Borough Market and London Bridge. Extremely helpful staff and reasonable price for drinks during happy hour (for London). Would stay again.",5,2017,08,07
120,Great Experience,"It was a great stay, the staff were always helpful. It was a nice room and the Hotel was in a good location to the tube and other site on the southbank. Easy walking distance to the Thames. This is one of the best Hiltons I've stayed at !!!!",5,2017,08,06
120,No negatives,"Arrived two hours early, and just expected to drop off our cases. Our room was ready, and we were handed the keys - good start. Staff attentive, helpful and courteous on all occasions. Room very nice - the whole hotel looked fresh and clean. Bed comfortable, and absolutely no noise disturbances (apart from a late disco on Saturday night - only just audible, and didn't keep us awake for many minutes). Enjoyed our stay. No negatives.",5,2017,08,05
120,Highly recommended,"My husband and I planned to stay in London for 4 days of theater and sightseeing. I have been to London many times and have stayed in at least 5 other London Hilton properties over the years. I am a Hilton Honors Diamond member. I booked a standard twin room after reading many excellent reviews of this newish hotel. I did this at least 6 months in advance and was able to book at £150 per night. I liked the fact the hotel was literally behind the Tate Modern, The Globe Theater and Bankside (on the Thames River). We were upgraded upon arrival to an Executive twin room on the top (7th floor). This was a very spacious room with two generous-sized comfortable twin beds and lovely puffy white bedding.  The TV was across from the beds so you could watch TV in bed. There was a ‘lounge’ area with a couch, coffee table and across the room, a desk and chair. Our view faced a small courtyard area and we could see the Shard building. The bathroom was well appointed, large and had both a bathtub and shower. I am always happy to see a lighted magnified mirror. As usual, we had access to the executive lounge, a very lovely large room with comfortable upholstered chairs and tables. We had our daily breakfast there and also cocktails, beer, soft drinks and yummy finger food. Lots of smoked salmon, whitefish, small shrimp, and fried tidbits. All of the staff we encountered in the hotel, the front desk, the wait staff in the lounge and the floor cleaners were friendly, courteous and very helpful. The hotel does have a fitness center and pool, but we did not visit either.",5,2017,08,03
120,"Oooh, Fabulous","This is such a great hotel, great staff who are so polite and helpful! We upgraded to a one bdrm and it was so nice. 

We did have access to the morning breakfast buffet which was so good and also the executive lounge which was also good. Next time we would probably only do one or the other as we didn't really need the executive lounge as we were gone all day.

We would definitely stay at this hotel again.  Close walk from the tube station.",5,2017,08,01
120,really good,"Overall really good, checkin staff + porter + bellboys magnificent and efficient and plenty of desks  so no queueing (why do so many hotels not think of that) 

Room spacious, and well appointed and brilliant shower, also despite being inner city little street noise, bed exceptionally comfortable

Good location, walking distance from a huge amount of tourist things aswell as the city and other business areas, aswell as tube nearby  and RV1 runs to covent garden from outside 

Good area for cafes/ coffee shops/ rests etc also  (but avoid the sainsburys local nearby its grotty with miserable service especially Weyne)  there is a coop and a Tesco just as close 

Bar was really good but staff can be overworked on a friday / Saturday and the strain seems to show although on other days its excellent  

Free and very fast wifi THANK YOU finally Hilton provides it for free

Spacious fridge for your own food items doing away with the automatic mini bar with no space for other items that hilton always insisted on having THANK YOU again 

Would return tomorrow if I could get the same rate (141 gbp) 

Some minuses
- room had not much natural light very narrow window - seems to be a uk thing to make the construction cheaper I understand, not enjoyable to work in the room in the evening  if on a business trip
  - room sometimes cleaned only at 1700 to 1900 which was odd and cleaning a bit sporadic in terms of if all items are supplied 
- room service food pricing was cheeky again a UK / Europe thing eg cheeseburger in the bar gbp 14  but for room service 18gbp plus service 12.5% (again cheeky) plus tray charge ..... very unnecessary",5,2017,08,01
120,Wonderful weekend break,"Fantastic hotel, ideally located where every single member of staff were professional, attentive and friendly.

Standards of cleanliness were exceptional, fittings and fixtures of the highest standards, food superb.  Did not have a chance to visit the spa or gym but will certainly be returning.",5,2017,07,30
120,Lovely hotel - poor service,"This is my second visit to this hotel; it is excellently situated for both business and leisure trips, and the rooms are spacious and well appointed.

My only gripe is that when arriving back at the hotel at 16.00 I found that my room had not been made up.  It took almost an hour for this to be rectified, and rather than apologising staff in reception told me that a special request was required if guests wanted their room to be made up before 18.00.

As a frequent visitor to Hilton branded hotels worldwide I have not encountered this before - and hopefully I will not again.  ",3,2017,07,30
120,Great design hilton.,"The hotel is located south of the river, near the tate modern and borough markets. Not traditionally the best London location but this might lead to a pleasant surprise. The hotel is very close to the southbank and some lovely bars and restaurants and also the southbank has beautiful views. 

Check in was smooth and easy and my room was ready early which was a plus. The member of staff which checked me in was kind enough to show me the bar restaurant and exec lounge as it was my first time staying here. The lounge is very good when compared to other hotels which a nice breakfast choice and soft drinks throughout the day, afternoon tea and canapes with wine, beer and spirits in the evening. 

The hotel itself quite uniquely designed for a Hilton. The rooms are large with comfy beds great showers and deep fast filling baths. Non alcoholic mini bar was free and the executive lounge was well designed with nice polite staff and a good selection of snacks and drinks. 

All staff encountered were professional and pleasant. Sometimes rates here are quite inflated but when they are right it is a great choice in London. Best hilton in the city by some distance (and there are many).",5,2017,07,30
120,London Hilton Bankside hotel," The London Hilton Bankside hotel was perfectly situated to tour London from, the London eye, to the shard, river cruises on the river Thames,  Burroughs market only blocks away everything about this hotel and location was perfect. ",5,2017,07,29
120,Great Location,"Very friendly staff, fantastic restaurant with a wonderful breakfast (make sure you add it to your reservation) and close to many great activities. The bar has a good happy hour as well.  No hot tub, but nice pool if you need a little extra exercise.",5,2017,07,29
120,Excellent Hilton,"Friendly staff, excellent executive lounge, decent gym, good large rooms, well located for transport options and feels very new still.

Bar is also pretty good for a hotel- large range of gins and cocktails.

All told, very impressive.",5,2017,07,29
120,One Of My Best Hilton Experiences!,"The Hilton London Bankside was a fantastic choice for our recent trip to London. The newly renovated and modernized hotel was lovely and the staff were helpful, accommodating, and friendly. The location is one of my favorites - quiet but not too far away from the hustle and bustle. It is a 5-10 minute walk from Blackfriars Underground Station, just across Blackfriars Bridge on the Thames, and affords easy access/connecting lines to Metro and Rail lines. It is also an easy walk to the Bankside waterfront area and beach. We walked everywhere from the location - to St James Cathedral and Fleet Street area, Shakespeare's Globe, the Tate, Borough Market and Tower Bridge area - I really find it to be an ideal location when visiting London. The on site restaurant is good, if a bit on the higher end of the price spectrum. Drinks were decent and about what you should expect to pay in London. I tend to do a lot of walking when visiting London, 7-10 miles a day at least, and it was absolutely heavenly to return to my room after a long day to find my bed turned down, slippers near the bed, the radio playing softly and the ambient lighting on in the bathroom and near the bed. Absolutely first rate service! I don't know if I will ever stay anywhere else when traveling to London!",5,2017,07,28
120,A Perfect Base for Both Relaxing and Sightseeing,"Quiet is important to me on vacation and our 6th floor room at the Hilton London Bankside was the quietest room ever! Overall it was a simply superb stay highlighted by a terrifically accommodating, stand-out staff: Concierge Mark gave wonderful advice and assistance, and the housekeeping staff's devotion to cleanliness was absolutely top notch. 

The less-congested Southbank location is refreshing, close to all types of transit options, with taxis always easy to find. So many wonderful restaurant and theater options nearby too. Can't imagine staying anywhere else in London. Their fabulous lap pool--so tough to find in a city hotel--was an added bonus.",5,2017,07,28
120,Average Hotel,"It was a nice hotel, it had a good location, friendly/helpful staff, and a heated pool :), but the rooms felt dirty :(. The washcloths smelled like barf. ALL of them did (we got new ones every time they did the room, and they ALL smelled). Also, the bed sheets felt dirty, even after they changed them. Other than the dirtiness factor the hotel was pretty nice.",3,2017,07,28
120,Great service and nice quiet surroundings,"Newly built ""standard"" hotel, clean and nice and with very helpful staff. Location also much better than anticipated, quiet but still not far to city center. Did not try any of the restaurants but menus looked ok. Very close to Tate modern and Shakespeare's Globe theatre.",4,2017,07,27
120,The best Hilton!!,"We stayed at Bankside because we have stayed before.  It lived up to our expectations again.  At a time when the Hilton brand is deteriorating and many of the extras are being removed, it is a pleasure to go to a hotel where this is not happening.  Our upgraded rooms were exceptional, the Executive Lounge was great with a good choice of food and the swimming pool is excellent especially before breakfast when we had it to ourselves.  The staff are friendly and nothing is too much trouble",5,2017,07,26
120,"Modern, New, Amazing","This hotel was an incredible surprise. I believe it is around 2 years old and really shows. The decor is modern and has every amenity you could think of: laundry service, gym, spa, fine dining, and a craft bar (highly recommend the happy hour). Finally the location is located across from the Tate Modern museum, which we loved!",5,2017,07,26
120,Birthday trip to London with friends,"I recently visited the Hilton Bankside with friends as we wanted a hotel with a great central location, with a pool and spa where we didn't have to worry about out of date rooms/poor service/ unclean rooms. I have to say having stayed in many hotels due to my work, this Hilton really exceeded expectations. It was the perfect stay from start to finish. Firstly the location is great and it's a 10 minute walk from the station. Secondly the staff were so accommodating and helped me with my luggage, the turn down service In the room was great. We had very efficient room service that wasn't overpriced. The pool and spa were immaculate and the treatments were really relaxing. It was exactly what you would expect from a 5 star hotel - no dramas, pleasant staff who were more than willing to help and large, clean rooms. Would totally recommend. ",5,2017,07,25
120,Amazing way to rest,"I´ve been in this property 3 weeks ago and the experience was amazing. The first thing that really liked was the lobby and the staff. All of them provide you an amazing welcome and help you out with the luggage. After did the check in they scort me to the room and it was spacious, bright and good views. Also the bed it was King Deluxe and also I had like a little lobby with nice sofa. The bathroom it was also spacious and the bed so comfortable.
 AlsoI went to the Distillery bar, the staff was amazing and the menu offer it was perfect, for lunch, dinner or just have a drinks. I want to say thanks to Alena from the restaurant, who provide me an excelent customer service and let me know what they serve me and the ingredients, so that is make me feel proud as they know what they offer to the guest. 
 Also a final review to Mr Cem Caglar, Manager-Front House, who I see how he manage the situation at all the times and I see that all the staff in the front of the house was highly motivate.
Thanks for the exceptional service provide.",4,2017,07,25
120,Comfortable & Convenient,"We stayed at the hotel. The location is quite close to Southwark Station; it has 4 grocery stores nearby, very convenient! It has an awesome swimming pool! The room is clean. The bed and the pillows are a bit too soft. The complimentary wifi jumps on and off. All in all, we had a great stay.",4,2017,07,25
120,Fantastic location,Great hotel but staff at front desk let you down too much attitude and not to help with luggage on arrival and departure is very bad on the bright side great location and penthouse room 10/10 but arrogant front of house staff ruined the stay,3,2017,07,24
120,"Such a friendly hotel, excellent","Stayed here for 2 nights on business in executive King rooms. Room was an excellent size, spotless, very comfortable and everything we needed and indeed would expect from a hotel of this rating. This hotel by far exceeded my expectations primarily due to the friendliness and welcome of all staff we encountered. This is my favourite of the Hilton hotels I have stayed in so far in London. Special thanks go to the team on reception,  Rodiney, Peter and Gregory (hope I remembered that correctly) in the Executive lounge.
The hotel is very well placed for many restaurants, Tate, city and Millennium Bridge.
Look forward to returning.",5,2017,07,23
120,An amazing experience!,"I feel that we hit the jackpot with this hotel. My wife and I are quite particular and spoiled when it comes to hotels, but didn't want the expense of a 5 star hotel in London. Hilton Bankside didn't disappoint! Location was great and we walked everywhere. The Tate Modern is literally a 5 minute walk away, and Borough Market is 10 min walk. The staff was extremely friendly and attentive. Oxo restaurant was excellent. The executive lounge was so good we decided we didn't need a separate ""High Tea"" experience. And the beds and pillows! The best hotel bed I've ever slept in!",5,2017,07,23
120,Loved Hilton Bankside,"Spent two nights at the Bankside in one of the executive king rooms. Beautiful room with all the amenities that I needed. Lots of plugs to charge all my electronics.

I highly recommend upgrading to the executive rooms so the breakfast is included daily and well as drinks and snacks later in the day. Breakfast consisted of a choice of cereals, pastries, cheeses, eggs & bacon. I did see people ordering other hot food but I usually had cereal and eggs. I was staying there during the heat wave so it was great to come back to the hotel later in the afternoon and grab a sparkling water to cool off. 

If I had one compliant and it's only a small one it was the shower head. The angle of the shower head couldn't be adjusted so I had to stand on the slope of the side of the tub to be under the water. However I could hold the shower head to rinse off. 

The Bankside is about a 15 minute walk away from Borough market which was the perfect spot to grab something to eat. 

Two tube stations are close by one being Southwark and the other being St Friars. 

Thanks to the staff at Bankside for a great stay. ",5,2017,07,22
120,Great as allways,"This was my 3rd time staying at this hotel. As usual, everything is super great! I love this hotel! Super-friendly staff and great rooms with nice comfy beds! I will definitely come back next time visiting London",5,2017,07,21
120,NOT THE AVERAGE FIVE STAR,"Stayed here with my family in the beginning of July and had my best stay ever. So good I decided to create a tripadvisor account to share my experience with you all. When we arrived we were met by a charming young man named Robert who helped us with our bags and took us up to the reception where we had the pleasure to be checked in by the manager Per Granstrom. With passion and great knowledge he explained about the hotel and the surrounding area, as if he had lived there his entire life and this made it a lot easier for us to explore this gorgeous city. Every member of the front desk team always greeted us by name and nothing was ever too much when we asked for help. 
The rooms were spotless and if you guys are in to gin, do not miss to visit the bar to try some of the delicacies on offer.
On check out, the lobby team again all wished us a safe onwards journey and this is the biggest difference between this five star hotel and other, the passion and genuine people working here. THANK YOU!!",5,2017,07,21
120,Enjoyable Stay,"We have stayed at Bankside Hotel a few times and love it. It is a lovely modern, fresh hotel with very friendly staff. Per, the Reception Manager is excellent and goes the extra mile to accommodate all your needs. Will definitely stay many more times ;-)",5,2017,07,20
120,Thoroughly recommended ,"Stayed for 2 nights and certainly wasn't disappointed. The quality from check in to checkout was excellent. Great professional staff ready to help when needed. Stayed in Club Room so had access to the Club Lounge which was superb for breakfast and drinks and canapés in the evening. Actually, the canapés and drinks are so good that you have to be careful not to spoil any dinner arrangements you may have. Rooms are very good. Modern, spacious and well appointed. Spotless!! Close to Borough Market, museum and many attractions but not right in the middle of the busyness that London can present. Again, a great find and thoroughly recommended. ",5,2017,07,20
120,Great hotel.,I stay regularly at Hilton's and have Diamond status. This was my first visit to Bankside. It rates very highly for amenities and service. Definitely one of the best I've visited. Good value too. A great choice for a visit to London,5,2017,07,19
120,London visit,"Traveled to London for vacation. The London Hilton Bankside is centrally located to all the popular sites. My family and I stayed in two king bed rooms which were very nice. The beds were very comfortable, the food at the hotel was great. The staff were very friendly and helpful in providing directions, and setting up our transportation needs. Should I ever return to London I would definitely stay there again.",5,2017,07,19
120,Great stay!!,"Nice clean modern hotel. My daughter and I were there for a family event. We had a twin room. The beds were over sized twin beds and were very comfortable. The room was spacious. There was a closet for hanging clothing but there was only 1 deep drawer for any other clothing you didn't want to hang. The bathroom was large. Nice shower. The mirror did not ""fog up"" when showering. There is also a speaker in the bathroom so you could hear the TV. There is a small refrigerator and a pot for heating water for the tea or coffee that is provided in the room. The staff was very accommodating. We did eat in the restaurant for breakfast. The staff did not show any urgency in servicing us.",5,2017,07,19
120,"Expensive, but rather Grand","Ideally located for the Globe or the Tate Modern, a very modern, well appointed hotel, excellent staff and great breakfast. Yes, it costs, but for an occasional splurge it is well worth while. You could stay at the Premier Inn on the same road for a lot less, but for a taste of luxury ....",5,2017,07,18
120,Amazing!,The hotel is absolutely beautiful! The reception area is so welcoming and the staff who dealt with us were a great help. We made the most of the facilities; the pool was stunning and always quiet although I don't know why more people wouldn't want to spend some time there! The gym was small but ideal. Bed was beautifully comfortable and the bathroom was very modern. I would definitely recommend. Breakfast was delicious each morning. I would stay here again.,5,2017,07,17
120,Amazing Staff and Room Service,"Everything about the hotel and staff made our stay much more enjoyable. We had 0 problems with the hotel, and I definitely recommend that you stay here. It's perfect for any situation, if you're on a honeymoon, business trip, family trip, or just a few days with friends, come here.",5,2017,07,17
120,Fabulous Birthday Treat,"Booked 2 rooms for a birthday treat for my wife with my son. 
Check in a breeze-rooms fabulous and relaxing!
We were hungry and needed more than bar snacks. The staff in the Distillery gave us the OXBO restaurant menu and had the chef make us what we needed and served us in the Distillery as OXBO not yet open!! Really wonderful as we were tired and wanted to eat there and then before going out to the theatre. 

They really went the ""extra"" mile for which I am truly grateful.

When we returned to our rooms after late lunch as it was my wife`s birthday staff had put some fruit and cakes in both rooms with a card. Really special.

Can`t thank you enough for making my wife`s birthday an event.
Thanx again.

We will be back.",5,2017,07,17
120,Amazing London,"i just stayed at this hotel for 1 night after i had arrived in london on des 2016 from Jakarta By Garuda Indonesia. for the services aspects, furthermore, was very good. the room services and breakfast menu is the best",5,2017,07,17
120,"Excellent hotel, ideal for Tate Modern","We only had 1 night to stopover but this was the perfect place to stay for a leisurely visit to the Tate Modern and Southbank area. The museum is literally 200 metres away. The hotel was modern and warm, staff were excellent and breakfast was lovely.",5,2017,07,16
120,Disgusting,"We were treated so badly by the night manager. We were drinking in the distillery, spending lots is money, refused to be served any further and told we couldn't have the room key. After arguing our point the key was given over. This is my favourite hotel and sadly won't be staying again after the way they made me feel. ",1,2017,07,16
120,Great Hilton ,"Loved this Hilton. So convenient. And the people were fantastic. The executive lounge was great. And the restaurant very high quality. 

Windows in room are a little small so rooms can seem dark. But I thought overall it was great. 
",5,2017,07,15
120,Great London hotel. Really great staff,"Just had a couple of nights at the Hilton Bankside.. really impressed in every aspect.. great staff, great facilities, spacious room, and the property had lots of character - not as ""corporate"" as you might expect from such a well known chain.. Hilton Bankside will be my new no.1 choice of where to stay when in London. Each and every staff member we encountered during our stay went out of their way to be pleasant.. I also had to work from the hotel one day and found the standard wifi to be perfectly suited to my needs. Thanks for a great stay! :-)",5,2017,07,14
120,London Hilton Bankside stay,Be sure to include executive lounge in your room booking - excellent provision of food and drinks. Not all rooms have a view but the courtyard view is not unpleasant if you are out or using the lounges. The location is excellent with short five minute walk to Southwark tube station.,5,2017,07,14
120,Issue during Check-in but Overall Enjoyable Stay,"This was probably the fanciest Hilton I have stayed at thus far. Upon arrival, you will see that are many staff readily available; they have a doorman, concierge and check-in and each are there to help with any assistance. When I did arrive, I had somewhat of an issue with check-in. The issue I had was that I pre-checked in with the mobile app and it pre-assigned me a room and I could not change it; yet when I arrived (even a few hours after check-in time and after the time I said I would arrive), the room selected for me was not available. This is somewhat odd since the room was pre-selected for me, so the room should be available. Fortunately, I did book a King Suite, so I had access to the Executive Lounge and waited there for about an hour and a half until my room was ready. The front desk was apologetic and did offer another room, however, since the room that was pre-selected for me was on a higher floor, I decided to wait it out. This was the only issue I had with the hotel, otherwise it was great.

The Executive Lounge here was the fanciest and well stocked executive lounge I have been to. The lounge is open from around 6 AM until 10 PM and serves a light breakfast (two hot dishes, fruit, smoked salman, pastries, etc; portion of what is offered in the OXBO restaurant), afternoon tea with pastries and appetizers in the evening. The food here was pretty good quality and was replenished even with the crowd. There was always soda, water and coffee (fresh grind from machine) available. Overall, it was a pretty good lounge. 

On to the room itself, the King Suite we were given was pretty amazing. The room had a 1.5 bathroom and the full bathroom had both a shower and a bath. The beds themselves were super plush and the pillows were dense since they appeared to be feather pillows. The sofa bed was fairly comfortable for a bed. The insulation in the room was great, we never heard anyone near us. The one thing about the room that did bother us was the amount of light switches in the room. Somehow, we ended up in a weird configuration and had to figure out that the switch in the entrance controlled the rest of the light switches. AC in the rooms worked very well and you could customize it to how cold you want, there didn't appear to be a limit. There was a closet and full size mirror as well as an umbrella you could borrow if it rained. There is also a safe which could fit a small laptop in. One of the nice perks about the room is that there is a mini-fridge where the non-alcoholic beverages are free which is nice to come back to after a long day. Overall, the room was pretty enjoyable and relaxing after a long day out. 

The staff at this hotel is pretty great and friendly. Everyone does say hi to you when they see you. The bellman and the doorman are equally great and the latter will help fetch a taxi for you. Housekeeping did a phenomenal job as well. There is a gym in the basement and is open 24 hours which is great since we worked out late at night. 

Location-wise, this hotel is relatively close to the London Eye. It is a bit of a walk, but by taxi, it is about a 5-10 minute ride due to traffic. There are plenty of restaurants nearby within walking distance which was a plus. Outside the hotel are two small convenient stores and also an ATM. Location is fairly good since you aren't in the hustle and bustle of all the tourists, but close enough to get where you need quick. 

Overall, I enjoyed the stay other than the issue on check-in (which might be more of a Hilton Mobile app check-in issue). I would recommend this hotel to my friends and family.",4,2017,07,14
120,Bank on Hilton Bankside!,Hotel is the perfect location for site seeing.  Close to plenty of restaurants. Staff was wonderful and room was well appointed. Highly recommend it a stay here.  Per at the Front Desk was extremely helpful.,5,2017,07,13
120,Fabulous! ,"Stayed here as part of our 10 year wedding anniversary and we were not disappointed! We arrived early on check in day and our room was already prepared which allowed us to be able to venture around the local area sooner than expected. Our room (and bathroom!) was large for a London hotel, comfy beds and the breakfast was great. The hotel is within walking distance to lots of bars and attractions. Staff were amazing and really did go above and beyond to make our stay a memorable one and we will certainly be going back. Overall this hotel is fabulous, great value for money and we would recommend to anyone wanting to visit London. ",5,2017,07,12
120,Excellence in service and location,"The hotel is very central, it is possible to walk until London Bridge easily, since it's near Tate Modern.  I felt welcomed in the hotel, the service and cleanliness was impeccable and I will be back there. (Already booked my stay for the next weeks!)",5,2017,07,11
120,Excellent Hotel in a great location,"From the moment we arrived the service was superb, the staff could not have been any more helpful or friendlier. Every single person greeted you with a hello and a smile. We stayed for 2 nights over the weekend in a King Room. The room had everything you required and the bathroom was very large with a wonderful shower. Our room included bathrobes and slippers, which was a pleasant surprise. We were on the second floor next to the lift and our room was very peaceful, there was no view but we did not stay for the view.
Breakfast was superb, buffet style, an enormous choice with the chef cooking fresh omelettes, and pancakes on request. He cooked eggs the way you wanted and was happy to cook my sausages a bit more for me.
We had a birthday cake to transport home after our stay and they were more than happy to assist in repackaging it for us.
The hotel is situated just behind the Tate Modern and within an easy walk of the river and Southwark tube station (10 minute walk)
Although this is on the south bank it would not deter us from staying here again even if we wanted to be on the north side, as there is no guarantee that the hotel you may find on the north side would surpass this one in customer service.",5,2017,07,11
120,Great surprise on my first time staying south of the river,"It was the week of Wimbledon and hotel rates were very high.  I have never stayed south of the river and was delightfully surprised by this clean, nice, property.  Rooms are spacious.  Service is great.  I liked the location which was just a block from the Tate Modern.  I walked to many locations in London in less than 30 minutes since the weather was so perfect.  
If I had to choose something that could be improved on:  The bathtub shower could pose a problem for people with mobility issues since it is quite high off the ground.  The big shower head only sprayed water on the curved part of the front of the bathtub so to bathe both sides of your body required some flexibility and precarious positions for my feet.  I heard this same complaint from many others in my group.  
The cook, who makes eggs to order for the breakfast buffet, was never able to cook an over easy egg only over very, very hard with a rubbery texture.  The scrambled eggs on the buffet were very runny and soupy.  It's a basic breakfast, nothing special but not bad either.  
Housekeeping always got a late start.  I would put my ""please make up room"" sign on my door when leaving by 8am and coming back at 4 or 5pm would find it still there with the room not serviced.  I called down and it was cleaned immediately.
The business center is superb.  
One of the main reasons for choosing this hotel was that there was a black-tie event in the ballroom for a group of around 500 colleagues.  The service and food were impeccable.  Great job.  
The very minor mishaps were nothing in comparison to the high quality of service and the spacious rooms.  I recommend this property.",5,2017,07,10
120,Superb the very best hotel!,"The staff memeber here were extremely professional and kind. The hotel was beautiful, sadly I did not have time to take advantage of their spa. Great breakfast daily, by far exceeded expectations. I am still dreaming about all the fresh pastries and creams! Fantastic staff and great location. I hope to return again soon!",5,2017,07,10
120,Excited,"Overall exciting, educational. Met some wonderful people from holland, Italy, France, England and Australia. Had some great meals and lots of interesting conversations. The sole purpose of this trip was to see an exhibition at the Bankside Gallery and was totally amazed by the art and artist!",5,2017,07,09
120,Conference ,Attended a conference here for the day. The room and facilities were nice and the staff friendly and the catering was well tasty as was the lunch. Can't really fault this as a venue for business functions. Never stayed here so can't comment on anything else ,4,2017,07,09
120,Poor Management,"I  came to a corporate event, where I stored my suitcase, in what I thought was a secure cloakroom; this was brought out in error and left on the desk. I happened to be walking past as someone was about to take said suitcase (this has been verified on the CCTV cameras). Obviously, we have contacted the management of the hotel, who have down played the seriousness of this; they have basically said, nothing was actually taken, so it's alright... Correct, nothing was taken because I stopped someone talking the case, not because you secured it correctly. They have even said things such as, 'If it had been taken we have CCTV so we would have been able to identify who took this' and 'we didn't mishandle the bag at ALL'. 

I have put a complaint into Hilton themselves who did apologise but went on to say, I need to contact the general manager to escalate this... even though on my email I am quoting what I was told from the general manager. I feel they're just passing the book and dismissing my complaint. 

Definitely not what you expect from a Hilton hotel, very disappointing.",1,2017,07,07
120,Hilton Bankside - good base hotel. Perhaps a little overrated.,"No complaints about the location, staff service, room cleanliness and general experience. My only gripe was that I had expected more for the price and after reading other reviews I thought it would be similar to places like Apex Temple Court. It was good but not luxurious imho which is what I expected for the price.",4,2017,07,06
120,Staffed by people who don't speak English,"This review is specifically about the service you can expect as a business user.

The mobile telephone signal in the hotel is poor. I urgently needed to speak with a delegate and could not reach him, so I telephoned reception. Whoever took the call could barely speak word of English. I had to spell the most basic details out and repeat numbers several times. Even then I could not make myself understood.

I would not recommend this hotel to a business user. This was a significant business conference, ruined by someone who should not be put near a telephone.",1,2017,07,06
120,Excellent Hotel,"An excellent 5 star hotel in a great central location, and attractively priced compared to comparable standard hotels in London. The rooms are stylish and modern, if slightly compact. Facilities are top notch, and the bathrooms feel suitably luxurious. A good choice and would recommend again.",5,2017,07,06
120,Best Location - London Bankside,"Our first trip to London, so glad we picked the Hilton London Bankside location in a quieter side of town, just a 5 minute walk to the riverfront activity with museum/theatres, ferry service and walking bridges.  Restaurants on-site and transportation of all kinds nearby.   Excellent service, clean rooms, staff is great.  Very happy experience with this hotel.  Highly recommend for family or business.",5,2017,07,06
120,Good choice,"Enjoyed our stay for business at this modern, doesn't-feel-like-a-Hilton hotel. First time staying on the south side of the Thames. Quiet rooms. Did not hear street noise on third floor. A rarity. Great neighborhood with access to plenty of Tube stations, food, Borough Market, Blackfriars. Tate Modern a five-minute walk. Attentive service. Cool, modern feel to rooms. Right shower-pillow-iron trifecta for business travelers. Would return with family. Appreciated free juice and water. Throw a Nespresso in room and it'd be 100%. ",4,2017,07,06
120,Fantastic hotel in good location,"The room absolutely fantastic, we stayed in Executive King Room with Lounge Access bed very comfortable, good breakfast, executive lounge with drinks and canape, very good and professional service. Location very good, near river Thames, one of the best hotel I ever stayed in. Recommended?  ohhhhhh yes!!",5,2017,07,04
120,Great Hotel and staff,"This is a great hotel! the rooms are comfortable the staff is great and helpful especially the concierge desk! Modern rooms, great breakfast and executive lounge with evening snacks and tea .The pool in the basement was a wonderful place to relax. We would highly recommend it  for staff, location, and facilities. The only thing I wished they had was a self service laundry and a better setup for using the hair dryer( in the bathroom or a bigger mirror)  Ask about the foxes!",5,2017,07,03
120,Perfect hotel in a perfect location,"Second time I stayed in this hotel and it was as good as the first time. Nice, modern and clean. Staff is very professional and the rooms are spacious and well equipped. Breakfast is superb served in a very nice atmosphere. Hilton certainly does not disappoint with this hotel!",5,2017,07,03
120,Wonderful staff and an excellent property,"Hilton Bankside – London

When searching for a hotel in London, my wife and I set certain criteria:  1) we wanted to be central to the attractions, 2) we wanted to be comfortable and taken care of, and 3) we wanted to have that little extra attention to detail that can make the difference between an “ok” stay and a “WOW” stay.  I can safely say that this Hilton, not only met those criteria, but exceeded far past them.

From the moment that we arrived (we were hours early for check-in), the staff took excellent care of us.  We had traveled all night (literally) and were tired and hungry.  Our room was not yet ready, but our luggage was secured and we were shown to the executive lounge (we did book an executive room) for a very welcomed breakfast.  This was the standard for this hotel, and we were extremely pleased.

Although we waited some time for our room, as was to be expected, it was ready hours ahead of schedule and we were accommodated early.  The front desk and bell staff could not have been more professional.  They are to be commended.  We were soon whisked away to our room.  This day was looking up for us!

When we arrived in our room, it took every bit of strength we had not to plop onto the inviting bed and sleep.  Although we managed to stay awake and wander about the city for a short while, eventually, we succumbed to the temptation of what turned out to be a most excellent and fabulously comfortable bed, and slept.

The next day we awoke after such a wonderful, peaceful sleep, we needed coffee and breakfast!  Although we had access to the executive lounge, we opted for the regular dining room.  The only reason for this change was that we had already tried the lounge and just wanted to see how the dining room offerings differed.  

The breakfast was absolutely wonderful, with a brilliant buffet of just about anything you could want.  Seriously, the hotel truly catered to many different cultures in the food choices and it showed.  We opted for eggs-to-order and they were perfect.  There was also fresh fruit, fresh juices, salads, cold cuts, cereals, fresh breads of a huge variety, and there were even fresh pancakes made from carrots and quinoa.  It truly was a fun and exciting breakfast offering.  We could not have been more pleased.

All these things happened in the first 24 hours of our arrival, and we had 3 more days to go.  We were not disappointed!  Each day, as we began our adventures, the staff would offer us a good morning, bid us a good day, and welcome us back each evening, each time by our names.  

All in all, I would say that our time in the property was an extremely pleasant and enjoyable time, not because of one thing in particular, but because of ALL the things done so well, with such ease.  I would, without any hesitation, recommend this hotel to anyone seeking an upscale lodging in the center of London.  The quality versus the price, in my opinion, is well worth it.",5,2017,07,03
120,Lovely hotel and very helpful staff,"Stayed for one nighr with my 7 year old daughter, we were in twin room 112 which was very nice. The twin beds were large and very comfortable.
We used the indoor pool which was a lovely way to end a day of sightseeing.
I would have no hesitation in recommending this hotel to anyone",5,2017,07,03
120,"All good, just avoid room service!","The Hilton Bankside has a priviledged location. Two blocks away from the Tate Modern and from the Southwark subway station this is an amazing place to stay in London. The neighborhood vibe is corpy, but with many good restaurants and stores around. The hotel feels quite new, the rooms have great space, good linens, big bathrooms, great toiletries and very good service. The internet works well, and its overall a great Hilton Experience. The price is right. The only thing I do not recommend is room service. The food sucks.",4,2017,07,03
120,Holiday,Super nice hotel. Excellent location. Very clean room. Had a late dinner and the filets and creamed potatoes were great. Staff were helpful and very professional. The doormen were very attentive and helpful. ,4,2017,07,02
120,Amazing upgrade to executive,"We were lucky to get an upgrade to the executive room which was fantastic. Access to the executive lounge was great, beautifully decorated hotel with gorgeous food to offer. Only 5-10 minute walk from nearest tube on the jubilee line so great for getting around London.",5,2017,06,29
120,Excellent stay!,"This is a beautiful and luxurious hotel in a very nice centrally located neighborhood in London (close to Southwark and Blackfriar's tube stations). The service was excellent; they often brought or left extra goodies in our room (strawberries, wine, etc.). The room and bathroom were very clean, modern and spacious. The pool was heated and the entire room with the pool in it was heated as well, making it very inviting (I swam almost every day I stayed there). The bed was extremely comfortable. The design of the hotel is well done with little fox details in various places. They offer turn down service each night and really thought of every detail. There were no unexpected or hidden charges. We loved it!",5,2017,06,29
120,Favourite Hilton,"stayed here before...loved it then,still do...great location,staff,rooms,pool,exec.lounge,bar ....just a fabulous hotel,with a great vibe.....think its my favourite Hilton anywhere! Come and see for yourselves....you'll not be disappointed",5,2017,06,28
120,"Best Hilton in London, maybe Europe!","The hotel staff was excellent in every sense of the word.  They greeted us each and every time in the lobby, or outside.  They took care of all our needs whether in was in the hotel or an attraction we wanted to see.  The rooms were clean and comfortable and hands down the best duvet of any hotel we have stayed at,  we are diamond members  we stay in a lot of hotels.   They have a wonderful executive lounge and complimentary water, juice and sodas in the room!   It is short walk to the Buroughs market and the Thames.  I cant say enough great things about this hotel!  We had an excellent time at Bankside!",5,2017,06,28
120,I want to go back right now!!,"Stayed here for a (too short) week-end With my husband. The staff was very friendly and helpful when we arrived. 
We booked a junior suite, and it was very, very Nice!! We had Access to the executive lounge, and the afternoon tea and breakfast was lovely! 
The location of the hotel is excellent! Close to the underground, and in the middle of a Nice area. 
I really want to og back here soon, and for a longer stay!!",5,2017,06,28
120,Modern Hotel in Upcoming Area of the City,"Modern decor with spacious comfortable rooms. Location is in Southwark and is close to The Globe Theatre and Tate Modern. Near a number of pubs and restaurants, this area of London has more locals and is a bit less touristy. Location is also just across the river from St. Paul's, Tower of London, etc.",4,2017,06,27
120,Yes...best Hilton in London!,"This is our new favourite Hilton. 
 It is new, beautiful designed and very nice location as well. Lenka Pecankova at the reception did perfect job, she made us feel welcome and gave us a nice room as well. The pool area is very nice and we also enjoyed couple of drinks at the bar.
Breakfast was superb and all the staff was nice to us. We will come back for sure!",5,2017,06,26
120,Really nice hotel in a great location,"Very nice hotel. Comfortable, upscale without being expensive.  All in a great location.  Near Tate Modern, short walk to Thames, Burough Market, and all the entertainment options along the river. Nice combination for a business trip with a little relaxation and sight seeing added in.",5,2017,06,26
120,Hilton Bankside,An excellent hotel with very welcoming and helpful staff. Our room was spotlessly clean. The restaurant served very good food with the breakfast and popular Sunday lunch being a highlight. The bar is welcoming and friendly. The hotel is well situated for lovely walks along the River Thames and close to the Tate Modern. Southwark underground station is a short walk for easy travel to other parts of London.,5,2017,06,26
120,Vacation in London,The location of the hotel is perfect to visit the London Bridge and Borough Market.  There is a London wide bike rental stand directly across from the hotel is the best mode of transportation to tour the entire city in a short amount of time.,5,2017,06,25
120,Urban stay,"The Hilton Bankside is a newly refurbished hotel and it in the middle of  and up and coming area. the Hotel is great and staff are friendly / welcoming to all.
its around the corner from the tate Modern and waterloo station. on the other side short walk to the London bridge and Tower bridge, its also very close to the river Thames so those walks are great in the evening or the day.

its also got the local night life and the eating shops just step out side'''

Borough market is only 10 mins away and again that feeling is great.

all in all this hotel is good , the view aren't the best but you go out for that.
the shard is 10 mins also...

However if you want to go to the west end then again not to far at all.

this Hotel has an Urban feel to it.. which is different to the others.. my veiw''",5,2017,06,23
120,Quality hotel,"Comfortable rooms welcome Receptionist and staff overall this was a really good experience very good rooms. Bar menu was limited but really tasty, delicious and enjoyable. Bar team was excellent and attentive ",5,2017,06,22
120,Accessible room not accessible for wheelchair users,"Sink in the accessible bathroom far too high for a wheelchair so could not be used at all during the stay. Staff informed. Would expect good standards from Hilton, failed in meeting our expectations. Would not use again due to this problem.",2,2017,06,22
120,A wonderful hotel to stay,"Good location, 5 mins walk to Southwark station. I like to feeling of Hotel's Lobby, beautiful design, fresh flowers and lovely smell. The room is big and all of the facilities are new. The hotel is not crowded and the breakfast is awesome. If you need a hotel that can truly makes you feel relax, this is it and I am very satisfied at the cost I paid to stay 3 nights.",5,2017,06,21
120,"Great rooms, service and hotel!","The room a here were spacious, with a very comfy bed. The breakfast was also one of the best I've had at a hotel with a great choice beyond the usual cooked breakfast (that I'm not particularly a fan of) of pastries, fresh pancakes, granolas and a host of other choices.
Everything was spotlessly clean and the hotel smelt fantastic. Would definitely recommend and stay again, and considering the prices of other hotels in the region, it's location makes it reasonably priced too.",5,2017,06,20
120,Amazing rooms and services ,I highly recommend this hotel. The room looked exactly like the hotel photos. It was clean and very roomy. My husband and I enjoyed our stay here. The staffs were very helpful and accommodating. The hotel is right next to Tate Modern and a 5 min walk to the Thames River and the Millennium Bridge. Also very close to M&S and Wacamama. We had breakfast at Oxbo and it was very delicious. ,5,2017,06,19
120,Fantastic stay in a wonderful hotel,"Just getting around to writing this... we visited in April, Easter Week, one of the busiest in London in recent years. Our son was studying for the semester at Kings College London and his dorm was nearby. We thought it would be a treat to all stay there together in a suite. Found a GREAT deal via the Hilton website (I'm a gold customer) on a one-bedroom suite.

I have stayed at top hotels all over the world, and I have to say this was one of the finest hotels -- with the best, most accommodating staff -- in which I have ever had the pleasure of staying.

Location: fantastic, on the south bank a short walk from the Tate Modern, the promenade behind it, Borough Market, and several tube stations, yet a quiet enough area so you don't feel in the middle of a downtown throng.

The property itself: BRAND new and beautifully appointed. No big city views, but our suite was incredibly luxurious and modern. And it was DEAD quiet; we never heard other guests. The lobby and public areas were ultra modern and comfortable and luxurious without being stuffy. As others have mentioned, the suite gave us access to the Executive Lounge, with its full service breakfast buffet, made to order eggs, cappuccino machine, drinks and snacks all day and fantastic wifi-- along with an incredibly accommodating staff.

The staff: from check in (accommodating us early due to an early fllght arrival) to giving us great restaurant and transit advice, to REALLY assisting us when my iPhone got stolen on Oxford Street, they made us feel at home and got to know us with friendliness and humor. As wonderful as the hotel is, the staff is what puts it over the top.

All in all, this has truly become my new favorite hotel and would highly recommend it to anyone; on top that, a great value! We hope to return soon...",5,2017,06,18
120,Bottomless Prosecco lunch,"I went here on a Saturday afternoon with my girl cousins to celebrate a 50th birthday,the lunch was amazing it catered for all food requirements the staff were friendly and very helpful they kept our glasses filled up all lunch time we had 1 waiter called Faris and he looked after us very well the atmosphere was buzzing after our lunch we took our drinks outside were the friendly staff continued to look after us, the reception was clean and smelt lovely I will definitely be returning.",5,2017,06,18
120,They make it easy to stay here,"A very modern hotel, very contemporary and great service. Always enjoy my stay here - service and choice at breakfast is good. Exec lounge please keep food going to the same time as the drinks service. ",5,2017,06,18
120,Wow wow wow and wow again ..,"I love this place. From check in to check out, the experience is brilliant. Look, we use to stay in stuffy Savoy, the awful Park Lane Hilton, the Park Lane Intercontinental, the Mandarin, Hotel 41 ect ect ... this place and people leaves them all well behind. The service levels are phenomenal and I am in wonderment how they have achieved such a high level .. clearly a great management team and wonderful immaculate staff. I lost a credit card visiting the poor Oxo Restaurant up the road, and the Concierge at Bankside went above and beyond in helping me try to locate it. The best Hilton Lounge in the history of Hilton Lounges and Breakfast, amazing. I could go on and on and on and on .. my compliments for excellence  ",5,2017,06,18
120,Beautiful Hotel and Location,"I'd stayed in the area previously and walked past this hotel. Ordinarily it would be pricey compared to some of its competitors, but having stayed here it was a price worth paying. 

We were warmly greeted at reception and being Hilton Gold had an upgraded room on the third floor. Considering the railway is just across the way we didn't hear anything. Beautifully appointed and clean rooms with a lovely wooden finish that hid the cupboards away. The room came with free complimentary soft drinks in the minibar, flat screen TV, plenty of sockets and a nice sized safe and cupboard. The beds were exceptionally comfortable and in our twin room we slept very well. 

The bathroom was clean and beautifully designed. The shower head adjustable in both water flow and height and was hot. It's great to have the speaker from the TV in the bathroom to listen while you're showering. 

Air con is quiet and effective, particularly on a hot London day. Southwark station is a short walk away making it very well connected and the Tate Modern is very much across the road. There are two small supermarkets on the same road if you want to stock up. 

Breakfast was amazing. Well presented with a great choice. One of the nicest hotel breakfasts I've had in a long while. The hotel also has a pool, but didn't get time to use that with a tight itinerary. 

Staff are exceptionally friendly and helpful and couldn't do enough for you. 

I was swayed to rebook for my return in a few weeks time. As you'd expect with a hotel like this, it was fully booked!",5,2017,06,18
120,Absolutely wonderful!,"Awesome stay. This hotel is modern, clean and has the best staff we've ever experienced. Everyone was friendly, professional and great at their job! We were there 12 days. We had the very nice breakfast buffet almost every day, we had room service twice, and ate in the restaurant once. The food was very very good, the prices in the restaurant what one might expect from a hotel restaurant. We asked the concierge some transportation questions and had to ask for help using the computer printer in the business center. Everyone was knowledgeable, helpful and gracious. Every few days, staff would knock on our door around 5 pm with a surprise snack or treat! Housekeeping was superb. I left a note asking for more pillows and a wastebasket the first day and it was already there when we returned that evening. I cannot say enough about how super our stay here was. One tiny thing for management to correct: tea selection in room was stale. Lastly, funny/funky interior decorations in the restaurant: animal heads on the walls that, upon closer inspection, were papier-mâché (I think) and floor to ceiling table separators that were similar to confessionals! I loved touring the city and going on day tours around England, then ""coming home"" to our quiet little street and hotel. And, if we wanted excitement and crowds, restaurants and the Tate Modern Museum were only a block or two away.",5,2017,06,15
120,2 day leisure visit,Excellent hotel overall. Great location and so central to so many major attractions. Customer service is of the highest quality. We really enjoyed out total experience at the Hilton Bankside and would strongly recommend this hotel should you plan a visit to London.,5,2017,06,15
120,Wonderful Hotel,"Excellent hotel, good location, beautiful decor, sleek, modern.  immaculate inside.  The best thing about this hotel is the staff.  All of the staff are friendly, helpful courteous and always greet you with a smile.  I loved my stay here.  Highly recommend this hotel if you are in London.  Breakfast and Lunch were superb also.",5,2017,06,14
120,Exceptional service and Facilities,"After staying in a lot of Hilton in various countries, Hilton Bankside is, by far, my favorite one. The design is  modern and very appealing. The room we stayed at was quite spacious. We especially liked the executive lounge which was well designed, stocked well with drinks and food, and has a staff that was attentive and helpful.  The close proximity to transportation and tourist sites elevated this hotel even further. But, what made our stay so much more memorable was the check in experience. The employees, especially Chiara, went above and beyond to fix some confusion caused by my double booking. Beyond the facilities, its staff like her that makes your hotel truly exceptional. ",5,2017,06,13
120,Fab exec lounge,"What a great facility. Arrived tired but fortuitously just at ""canapé"" time. Slid into the very well appointed executive lounge (free access with exec grade rooms) and enjoyed lovely wine and canapés at no additional cost

As a business woman travelling, I much prefer to be in an entry controlled lounge than a bar or dining alone in a restaurant. Great idea. Lovely ambience and excellent wine and snacks. Prawns, salmon, dips, cheese, samosas, fruit etc. All excellent

Well done Hilton!

HH",5,2017,06,13
120,Excellent Everything!,"Immaculately clean, vast choice of breakfast foods and the staff can't do enough to make the stay outstanding. We stayed last year and if anything it is even better, the rooms are beautiful clean and modern, we really enjoyed our visit to London. It is also perfectly situated for a walk along the Thames and near to some of the big attractions.",5,2017,06,13
120,Great Experience Hilton Bankside,It was a great stay. I thoroughly enjoyed the service standard of the hotel. The staff was very cordial and helpful. The quality of restaurant was also great in terms of food served and service. However the rooms were average in terms of space but well maintained and clean.,4,2017,06,12
120,Hilton at its best,We are all used to Hilton Hotels and know what to expect. The Hilton London Bankside is not what you would expect. Very modern with clean lines throughout the building. A short walk from local transport but right in the heart of London Southbank and bankside. Strongly recommended. Well done Hilton,5,2017,06,12
120,Best Hilton in the World!!!,"We returned to London for a quick, Memorial Day (US) or Banking Day (UK) weekend getaway visit and stayed here again after a wonderful stay here last June at the beginning of our trip to Wales and southwest England followed by a Greek and Croatian cruise out of Venice.  We again arrived very early, about 8:45 am, but were informed by a very helpful and friendly lady named Jan at the check-in desk that no Executive rooms were ready due to full hotel the night before.  We are Diamond and booked both nights on points.  Jan said we had been upgraded to an executive-level room but could give us a regular one immediately, but we opted to wait for the Executive room.  Jan promised to have one ready for us as soon as possible, and she did.  We were tired from flying all night and taking the Thameslink from Gatwick and then making the easy, short walk from the Blackfriars station.  We knew the quickest and easiest way this time from the train station and didn’t get lost.  We waited in the Executive lounge until just after 10 am when Jan came with the good news.  She had popped in once in between to let us know she had not forgotten about us.  Jan is an example of the best at what she does!  She always asked how everything was the several times we saw her during our stay.  We were in Room 358 this time. (not sure which one last year, but an Executive room but with the bed in the middle of the room and the desk behind the headboard??)  Room 358 is located at the very end of the building with a courtyard view of other rooms and the top of the Executive lounge directly below with its frosted roof.  (see picture)  This year’s room layout was much more efficient.  There was the king-sized bed (against the wall), a dresser with the mini-bar and fridge with a wide screen TV above, a small desk with chair in the corner, another chair with small table, and several closets.  The room had a safe plus enough available outlets after some rearranging.  The bathroom only had a shower with toilet and a wide sink.  Normal Hilton amenities were provided as well.  One great offering of this hotel for its Executive room patrons is free mini-bar for non-alcoholic drinks and snacks.  Only the alcohol and the adult box, as I called it, aren’t included as complimentary.  The adult box has adult things in it-use your imagination!  Everything was clean when we arrived and was cleaned flawlessly on our day in between.  When we were leaving on Sunday for lunch across town at the Windmill Mayfair, I found one of the housekeepers to tell her that we would be gone for about 3 hours, and she said that she would do our room next.  Great service and a hint to those who complain about not having room service-find someone and tell them you are leaving for an hour or so and nicely ask them to service your room while you’re out!  As Diamond, we receive complimentary breakfast, either in the lounge or the restaurant.  This time we ate in the restaurant both mornings.  The first morning our waitress was from Greece-not sure about our waiter the second morning.  All they really do is get you started with drinks and explain the buffet, but they leave you alone for the most part but are available, if needed afterwards.  I am on a stricter diet than usual and was mainly eating egg white omelets with lots of veggies plus some dark bread.  I did have to have a piece of what the English call “back bacon”, which is like our “country salty ham” in the US.  I usually had 2 omelets each morning and stuck to my diet fairly well.  The chef remembered me the 2nd morning and asked how my food was the day before, and I said it was great and was back for more!  They had bottled water on the buffet as well, both still and sparkling.  I don’t know why people drink gassy water; if I want something bubbly, I’ll drink champagne or similar.  We used the Executive lounge frequently and had great service again by everyone, especially young Peter from Budapest.  He called himself a Roma so he told me some gypsy stories, which were interesting and enjoyable whether true or not!  We hurried back from lunch followed by some shopping at Harrods so that we could have afternoon tea in the lounge.  It was nothing fancy, but I can now say I’ve had tea in London.  We visited each evening for the cocktail, snack time, which starts at 5:30 pm (17h30) with food out for 2 hours and drinks for 2.5 hours.  They have diet tonic so I enjoyed several gin and tonics the first night, and one or two the second followed by red wine.  Food was ok, but my favorite was the chilled shrimp.  I had over a dozen each night.  We had dinner reservations at 9 (21h) the first night at Joe’s Kitchen on Ludgate Hill near St. Paul’s and a Jack the Ripper tour the second night at 8 pm (20h) so we stopped eating about 6:30 pm (18h30) the first night but ate the second night until we left about 7:20 pm (19h20) for obvious reasons.  One could make a meal out of it or just an appetizer.  As mentioned, Peter was great, but everyone in lounge was friendly and helpful.  We had an 11 am tour (London City landmarks “free” walking tour) on Monday so we checked out about 45 minutes beforehand and left our luggage with the valet/concierge.  This was 5 days before the recent incident, but they checked our luggage by hand.  If they want to see my dirty drawers (boxer shorts), that’s fine with me.  It’s better to be safe than sorry!  Everything was fine on our return about 5 hours later so we powdered our noses and headed back to Blackfriars station for the Thameslink ride to the Hilton Gatwick for our 3rd and final night in the UK before our Tuesday morning flight home.
In conclusion, I can’t think of anything that upset me this time.  Everyone we encountered was professional, friendly, and welcoming.  The only negative was that we missed Alex, who was so great to us last year, since he was off for the weekend.  I love the location and now that I know how to use the Oyster Card and plan my London transportation, it doesn’t seem as remote as it did last year.  I prefer the more peaceful setting here than the hotels in the busier, more touristy parts of London with all their noise and congestion.  There’s a great co-op store just past the corner on the way to the river with great snacks at decent prices, there are 2 ATM’s within 20 yards/metres just outside the front door where I can get money with no service charges, there’s access by only one bus to the Strawberry Tour gathering spot for most of their tours near the Tower of London plus easy access to Gatwick via Blackfriars station and the Thameslink, and it’s an easy walk to St. Paul’s via the Millennium Bridge by the Tate, which makes this location work for me.  The Intercontinental Le Grand in Paris is my favorite hotel in the world, but this one is a close second and by far my favorite Hilton property in the world, and coming from Diamond members (and an IHG Spire Ambassador), this puts it at the top of a long list!  We will be back, and this will be our first choice.  Thanks to all…. My prayers and thoughts are with you all and with everyone in the UK after the tragedy at Borough Market and on London Bridge.  We had been in the market on one of our walking tours and crossed London Bridge on the RV1 bus each time we headed over to the Tower area for our 3 tours so the sights we saw on our television were very familiar.  Peace be with everyone!",5,2017,06,08
120,Beautiful & Friendly hotel,"Big surprise finding such a lovely and beautiful hotel 1 block form the Tate Modern. It was a terrific stay and would highly recommend it especially if you want to stay on Bankside.. so much to do just in that area, and it is a good way of getting to know this area.  Breakfast package was very worthwhile.",5,2017,06,08
120,Great hotel close to Tate modern and the globe,You couldn't get closer to the Tate or the Globe. Seriously. Hotel was nice quality. The workers do struggle to understand English though. Nice staff though. Great room. Kind of in a less tourist area. ,5,2017,06,07
120,Absolutely fantastic service!,"We stayed here for the second year running, as the company I work for hires the whole hotel to host it's annual Summer Ball, and I can honestly I've never been treated so well. The staff go above and beyond, in particular Eitvydas Gulevicius (Eddie) who was so friendly and helpful; nothing was too much trouble - truly 5* service! The rooms are spacious and comfortable, as you'd expect from a Hilton, and the buffet breakfast spread is one of the most varied I've come across - really lovely. We were there the night of the London Bridge attacks and the staff dealt with the whole situation incredibly well, managing to keep a building filled with over 600 well-lubricated people safe and at ease. Would absolutely recommend and would definitely return, thank you.",5,2017,06,05
120,Summer ball 2 night weekend stay,"Having stayed at this hotel several times now I can honestly say the the staff here are as good if not better than anywhere I have stayed worldwide. Very attentive but not overly and across all areas.
I cannot recommend this hotel enough.
Great room, lovely good , great atmosphere in bar and only a short stroll with many places of interest.
I would not hesitate in recommending the hotel to anyone.
Looking forward to returning!!!!",5,2017,06,05
120,Excellent Hotel,Stayed here for a awards evening and the stay was fabulous. The service is friendly and efficient and the decor and hotel itself are very modern. Our room was very neat and tidy and the bed was very comfy. It's situated in a perfect place to go sight seeing.,5,2017,06,05
120,Hilton London,"Very nice located Hotel with excellent service, really great breakfast and everything you need. But you need to ask for the right room, some of them are opposite of a huge wall without any view to a street.",5,2017,06,05
120,Fabulous stay,Great base and hotel. Staff and facilities are great. Well worth paying extra for the access to the executive lounge. Gergely could not have been more welcoming and helpful to us during our stay. The pool was a welcome and relaxing experience after a long day out. We'll definately be back !,5,2017,06,04
120,"Fabulous hotel, friendly staff, great location","We stayed for one night. The hotel is gorgeous and a 5 min walk from South Bank and the Tate Modern. Great for easy access to the Old and Young Vic Theatres. The staff are super friendly, lovely food and drinks and fabulous interiors. Would stay again. ",5,2017,06,04
120,Sensational service in South Bank.,"What a fantastic find and a great addition to the Bankside and Soutbank neighbourhood. This hotel appears unassuming however is very close to the river, the tate modern, the tube, and is half way between tower bridge and central london.

Service however sets this hotel apart, both from others in the area and Hilton generally. In fact the best service i have received from Hilton worldwide.  From the warm and professional welcome of Jan when we arrived to the exceptional professionalism and friendliness of Phoebe in the restautant - all were very memorable. 

The rooms are tasteful, spacious and well equipped. Only disappointment was lack of view - a wall a few feet away.  The pool however was great compensation. Beautiful gym and spa - amazing in such a central location.

 I tend not to like hotel restaurants however oxbo was exceptional.  I hate buffets, however the bubbles and brunch experience was outstanding.  

All in all a great experience and good value for money in a great location",5,2017,06,02
120,Much more than one would expect!,"The hotel is relatively new and very up to date without being sterile or overly modern and cold.  The services are tops and similar to though on a smaller scale than very traditional London luxury hotels such as Claridges and the Savoy, etc.  It is for what you get a real deal and while in a trendy neighborhood which is being gentrified, it remains real and accessible with excellent dining and transportation options and less of a 'mob scene' which can be the case often in central-central London.  Service is superb.",5,2017,06,02
120,Outstanding London Hotel,"The London Bankside is a beautiful hotel with a great central location.  The hotel has exceptional accommodations and each member of the staff we encountered, provided outstanding customer service.  We'd absolutely stay in this hotel again.  Highly recommended.",5,2017,05,30
120,Hilton Hotel Bankside,Our stay at the Hilton was delightful to say the least. We were received by Anneke Nieman who is was warm and extremely helpful at every turn. Every interaction from Front of House to Housekeeping to the Restaurant Staff was highly consistent. The quality and level of service remains unrivaled in all my travels and stays in London for business or leisure. Weekend family volumes are managed quite well given that breakfast tables are almost all taken up. The Chefs who work under this pressure do so with the most warm and pleasant demeanor. The consistency is something that is very difficult to go unnoticed.   Location is excellent with access to the city within minutes - walking or by public transport. Walking around the Borough is a must and the Hilton remains a gem of a find in and around a busy daytime hub.  Highly Recommended!,5,2017,05,30
120,Excellent family long weekend,"Very convenient location. It's 2 minutes from the Tate Modern (well worth a visit), 5 minutes walk from the Globe Theatre and 6 minutes from the water taxi (highly recommended as no traffic jams). Dead easy to get to Docklands and the West End. We went to North Greenwich and Covent Garden, Oxford St and Leicester Sq. 10 minute walk to Waterloo and the iMax. 35-minute walk to the West End.

The hotel itself is brand new. The decor is clean, modern and fun with little features like the foxes to entertain the kids. No worn carpets and the 2 bedrooms we had were in excellent condition. 

The pool is beautiful, the gym well equipped and the spa offers a good range of services. The beds are comfortable, the rain showers and baths are fabulous. The food is good and the martinis from the bar were perfect (we indulged in more than one!). The service from the doormen, front desk, concierge, bar staff, restaurant staff and housekeeping was exemplary. 

I took a peek at the ballroom it's in great order. I'm told it can take 600 people. A wedding was going on there and everyone was having a wild old time.

Whether for personal or business travel, weddings, parties or corporate events, the Bankside Hilton is a solid luxury property conveniently located, well run and placed in the heart of central London. The staff were well trained, courteous and preempted our needs consistently.

And they have the most comfortable pillows I've ever slept on. Where can I get some?",5,2017,05,30
120,Excellent stay,Can not fault this hotel. We stayed with a group of friends and the hotel was immaculate and the staff could not have been more helpful. There was no noise from inside or outside of the hotel at night which is a big bonus being a light sleeper.,5,2017,05,30
120,Great Hotel in a great location,We were extremely happy with this room. We were looking for a hotel on the South Bank and this was a great find. Terrific location to walk anywhere as well as easy transit links. Lots of amenities nearby and the hotel staff was very accommodating. Our room was an King Suite and was roomy and comfortable. Very happy with this hotel.,5,2017,05,30
120,Overnight stay for O2 event,"Right behind Tate gallery, nearest tube Southwark ideal for our needs. Hotel clean and efficient our room / bathroom very uptodate no issue with beds. Would happily stay again. Staff courteous and professional, breakfast well presented. ",4,2017,05,30
120,Fantastic Staff made our stay all the more enjoyable,"About a ten minute walk from Waterloo station the Hilton Bankside is a gem.  Ideal for business travellers and tourists as it's only 100 yds or so from the Tate Gallery and Bankside Pier.  There are plenty of restaurants and bars just a short walk away but the Hotel's Distillery Bar famous for its large selection of Gin didn't disappoint!  Our rooms were perfect:  modern, luxurious, clean and quiet. The breakfast was amazing and there was so much choice.  There is a Spa at the hotel although we didn't have any treatments, we did use the pool and jacuzzi.  We had a fantastic 3 night break but the best thing about this hotel was the Staff. They were all friendly, helpful and attentive.",5,2017,05,30
120,Great stay!,"Great hotel, great location! Price was good for the location, walking distance to many things. Room was very big compared to other area hotels. The bed and pillows were very comfy! Clean and friendly staff as well. The restaurant and bar was very good too! ",5,2017,05,29
120,Short break,Great location and very attentive service. Would absolutely recommend. Close the the Tate and globe theatre. Easy travel routes to the hotel with the bonus of a river taxi and sight seeing service a few minutes away. ,5,2017,05,29
120,Excellent hotel for business trip,"The hotel is very easy to approach by public transport. It is not a romantic hotel but a real business one.

The interior is very well designed even with the ""wolf lights"" on the wall. 

The breakfast is excellent",5,2017,05,29
120,"""Carefree ease""","As a regular Hilton visitor, I get to try out different Hiltons all around. This was my first stay at Bankside. It will not be my last. 
The staff is professional and friendly, solving any and all issues that can arise. The hotel is modern and luxurious, providing an excellent breakfast. 
Rooms are equipped with fantastic beds, albeit the duvets are slightly too heavy. I removed mine, and enjoyed the soft sheets instead. The bathrooms have showers and it all looks great. 
The pool opens from 6:00 to 22:00 and is an excellent escape from the city. Worth a swim!
The location, though away from the ""centre"", is located in hip Bankside. Take a stroll towards the Borough Market, and you won't regret the distance at all!
It is only a 45 minute walk from Piccadilly Circus, and it is a lovely walk!",5,2017,05,29
120,Great stay!,"We had a wonderful stay here! Rooms were beautiful and quiet! Hotel was a great location. Staff was very helpful. We walked everywhere. Such a clean, lovely, and wonderful hotel. We would definitely stay here again!",5,2017,05,28
120,Absolutely first class,We stayed here when we got delayed at Heathrow airport and what a stay . He executive lounge was spacious and very generous. The breakfast in a Sunday morning was very quiet and the service was world class from all of the team . I must stay here whenever you are in London ,5,2017,05,28
120,"Modern, top hotel","I've stayed at Hilton London Bankside twice in the past year. It has modern, elegant decoration and look. 

The staff is polite as you can expect, and they do their best to give you top service. I was not told at the check-in that my reservation included complimentary breakfast (luckily my colleague told me after I had checked in). 

The buffet breakfast is great, with quality items, and I especially enjoyed the omelette. Breakfast has hummus, tons of cheese options, pastries, egg station, freshly squeezed juices and so forth. 

The gym is small, it's very clean and machines are new. Although it could be improved. A smith machine would be a great addition as it now has many cardio machines.  Tip: You can use the showers in the gym if you have a late flight even after you've already checked out.",5,2017,05,27
120,"Nice hotel, convenient location","Stayed for a weekend. Check in staff were lovely with my 8 year old niece & arranged for mini- dressing gown & welcome pack to be waiting for her. Nice room, modern, well equipped. Breakfast selection good (albeit a little manic on the Sunday as there has been a big wedding the night before). Absolute only gripe was they forgot to make up our room. Would return her",4,2017,05,27
120,Elegant and modern Hotel in London's new hotspot,"The Hilton Bankside is a rarity among the Hilton hotels - for this centric property just steps from the Tate Modern museum, they chose to step up and embrace the artsy neighbourhood with an elegant twist.

Fantastically located in Southwark, it is just a short walk from Borough market, the Tate Modern, St Paul and the Thames river.

The hospitality offered is outstanding, from the doorman to concierge and every single employee, they represent British elegance, courtesy and an excellent service. 

The rooms are modern and beautiful, the restaurant offers a tasty variety of delicacies day and night and the bar offers live music and drinks in a beautiful ambiance. A gem by the Thames! Looking forward to visiting them again.",5,2017,05,26
120,Great modern hotel in London,"I picked this hotel for proximity to Waterloo Station for train to Southampton for a cruise. As a Hilton Diamond, I get great benefits too.  But this new hotel is really close to the Tate Modern and walking distance from Southark Underground Station. The rooms are ample and once you figure out wher the safe is, it is easy to put everything away for a 5 night stay.  The Executive Lounge staff were excellent since they handled my partners gluten intolerance very well.  Clean and modern and rooms are spacious enough for a long stay. Very close to St. Paul's and Thames.  ",5,2017,05,26
120,Fantastic experience!,A smaller house - very pleasing and a very modern interpretation of the well-known Hilton-theme - yet still high-class in its traditional caring for the guest. Executive lounge very tasteful and pleasant. Definitely a place to come back when in London again!,5,2017,05,25
120,Cleanest hotel ever,"This hotel is SO clean, and that is always top on my priority list. I'm a bit extreme when it comes to cleanliness, so for anyone reading, consider that huge praise for Hilton London Bankside if you're clean freak like me.",5,2017,05,25
120,Excellent Stay!,"From the moment we entered the hotel, we were provided with excellent service. ""Eddie"" had taken our bags and brought them straight away to our very spacious, clean room. We had some trouble with the converters and someone was there in no time to help us out. The breakfast buffet was amazing with many choices. We were always greeted with a smile after each of our excursions. Definitely would recommend and definitely would stay again.",5,2017,05,23
120,Great hotel,"Stayed here for the night while on business as it was recommended by the boss.

Very spacious rooms with friendly staff, good facilities and a great bathroom. The Bar and restaurant a little pricey, but that's expected.",5,2017,05,21
120,Great hotel! ,"This is a beautiful hotel with a great service, super clean and an amazing breakfast buffet. Its central. Only 20 minutes walk to the themes river and london eye. We stayed here for two days in an upgraded executive room with free entrance to the lounge. I have visited several hilton hotel and this is the best so far. The staff gave a good service. I absolutely recommend this hotel in London",5,2017,05,20
120,Comfortable ,"A great, comfortable stay. Good location- 2 mins walk from Southwark tube station. Friendly and helpful staff. Large rooms with lots of amenities and air conditioning. Plentiful and high quality breakfast. ",5,2017,05,20
120,Poor service,"I've been staying in this hotel on and off for the last month, due to a project. First, there was a purple lipstick stain when I ordered a coffee at the restaurant for breakfast. Another day, I ordered breakfast in the room and it came at £40 when it was supposed to cost £21 (this specific mistake I believe to be an honest mistake and one of the supervisors came to apologize). The worst part for me, however, is that on 3 occasions, I came back to my room late in the afternoon and housekeeping had not come yet. I had to call guest services to ask them to come, then go downstairs and wait, which is very annoying. Last time this happened, however, was the cherry on the cake, as I came back at around 3pm to my room on a Saturday, after being out for the whole morning, only to find the room still uncleaned. I called them and asked to have it serviced, was told to wait 5 minutes, and then another 5 minutes, on a sucession of 4 or 5 calls, until at last they told me to wait another 10 minutes (??). I felt very disrespected, especially with the level of service I had from the guest services line.",1,2017,05,20
120,"Will return! Excellent staff, facilities and service","Stayed at this hotel for a two night break.  As diamond members we are very familiar with Hilton hotels in London, the UK and around the world.  This was certainly the best by a long margin in the UK and on a par with some of the best overseas (such as Malta, Venice, Dubrovnik and Bangkok).  In particular the staff were outstanding, from the welcome at reception, the service at breakfast and in the excellent executive lounge (thank you Per, Greg and all your colleagues).  Nothing was too much trouble -
hard to achieve such consistency in central London. This will be the hotel of choice if staying in London in future.",5,2017,05,20
120,Great hotel in a growing area,"Spent a couple of nights here in April. The service was excellent. From arrival when doors were held open and bags taken care of, a quick and painless check-in, all the way through to a reluctant check-out: I was taken care of and never felt less than first class.  The concierge was excellent and I kick myself that I don't remember his name so I could pay tribute to him now. The hotel is clean and welcoming (a wonderful Easter display), the rooms well catered and comfortable. Breakfast was amazing, expensive yes but thoroughly enjoyable. Lots of options and all my choices were delicious. The surrounding area was super quiet and I heard no noise from adjoining rooms. It was lovely - just really lovely. Is there a negative? Not really but .... it is a long way from a lot of things. There's no tube station in the next block or two. Nothing is too far, but be prepared to walk a lot or catch a cab (which I did once at the end of a long day of walking). However it looks to be a growing area with more than enough cafes, pubs and restaurants to keep you happy (plus what the hotel offers). The Borough Markets are a few blocks away and they're fun. Tate Modern, Shakespeare's Globe and Millennium Bridge are all just a block away. Would I stay here again?......gosh i'd be really tempted to, despite the distance. Oh hang it, I'll do it!",5,2017,05,19
120,They are perfect..,"I have been in so many Hilton around the world, Bankside is one the good one. Staff is really good and the hotel is new.. Executive lounge is comfortable and staff is working hard to make you relax.. Location and surrounding is good.. Restaurants, Tate, museums, LPO, two tube stations are very close..",5,2017,05,18
120,Lovely Hotel and excellent staff!,"Stayed here for 2 nights as part of romantic weekend away.

Hotel itself is wonderfully designed and the rooms are excellent.  We did get an upgraded King Deluxe after asking (although I am Diamond member so may have helped) and the bathroom was exceptionally lovely

The staff are some of the nicest and most helpful I have seen in a Hilton - I literally had 5 every morning greeting us.

The Exec bar here is one of the best I have been in - the choice and quality of the food and drink was top notch!

The hotel location is also superb, right by the Borough Market and tubes etc. and short tube rides to everywhere else.

Only small gripes I have are (1) the scrambled eggs and porridge were undercooked on both mornings (sorry but you notice this stuff when staying in Hiltons every week) and (2) there were a number of occasions were staff were openly disagreeing with each other in front of guests.  Naturally such a workplace can be stressful but they should hide this from the guests.

However fab place and will defo be returning!",4,2017,05,18
120,Amazing Hotel,"Since this hotel in London opened myself and my husband have stayed here multiple times and we love it.

The staff are really friendly and helpful and the food in the bar and restaurant is amazing. We have also visited the oxbo restaurant for the Sunday brunch, which was worth every penny.

Also the cocktails in the bar are amazing and if there is a cocktail you want not on the menu the bar staff can make it.

Great location for a weekend break in London or if you are traveling on business.

We cannot wait till our next visit in July.",5,2017,05,18
120,Excellent hotel ,"Very nice hotel, with fantastic breakfast. Sorry to say the dinner is not at the same level.
I love the location, and the room and bathroom have high standards.
The hotel is located near the Tate museum, and the Thames.
So for dinner find another place.",5,2017,05,18
120,Nice hotel in a nice area,"Excellent hotel with a service oriented staff in a nice area. Easy to catch the tube from here or walk to the city centre. 
Rooms are spacious and nice, but breakfast is overpriced and disappointing. Poolarea is nice.

120,very nice hotel,"lovely hotel, attentive staff who kept their distance and did not hassle a perfect combination. some interesting and quirky decorative items to keep your eye and mind engaged. delicious breakfast. workable complimentary wifi.",5,2017,05,17
120,New and comfortable,"I have stayed here a few times and although you can not fault the hotel, as everything is still very new and well laid out, I find the reception staff to have a certain air of superiority and do not go the extra mile, in my opinion.
The contrary can be said of the Executive Lounge staff, especially Ana and Gergely, who are compassionate, friendly, extremely helpful and hard-working. The afternoon tea is quite an enjoyable experience.
Breakfast is quite an affair at the Hilton Bankside and different from other Hilton properties. It is very nice, with a wide variety of offerings, however things seem to run out as early as 9am and no replacement is provided.
The rooms are spacious enough for London and the bed is comfortable.
Good location for London Bridge and east of London.",4,2017,05,17
120,Great location!,"Hunter's lodge ambience and decent hotel amenities :) nicely located for a short walk anywhere. Wasn't going to comment more but TripAdvisor needed 200 words.

We were Hilton Gold members, but didnt look the part so it was forgotten during check-in. Honestly, it was quite annoying to have to prompt them if I would enjoy certain benefits versus then just outrightly offering them to me. Didn't get the executive lounge access. It's fine, I understand. I travelled a few times on first class flights, & self paid business class flights (most were company-paid mine you) and because I looked young and didn't wear fancy brands, I get ushered in the queue with economy passengers. So I do not fault Hilton for this.",4,2017,05,17
120,Impeccable!,"Can't say enough good words about this hotel. We felt right at home from the moment we walked in. Everyone was so nice and friendly, rooms were kept in ideal conditions, the size of the room were just right and comparing to other European hotels were on the bigger side. As Hilton Gold we have been upgraded to the higher floor with access to the lounge. But I think the most incredible thing about this hotel is their breakfast! The choices are endless, the food is delicious! And of course this hotel is centrally located to pretty much anything. We stayed there for 3 full days and we never even took a subway once, walking all around central London (everything between Westminister bridge and Tower bridge on both sides of the river). I wouldn't even think twice about staying anywhere else but here again when in London.",5,2017,05,16
120,Excellent hotel and wonderful service! ,"Flying in from the US on an early Saturday morning, I went to the hotel at 10:30 am figuring that I would leave my luggage with the concierge and walk around until I could check in and sleep. To my surprise, the hotel clerk told me that my room was ready. What a pleasure to be able to take a long nap and a shower and then go wandering portobello market. Hotel is also very conveniently located close to the Tate Modern, the riverfront and Shakespeare's Globe. In addition, the concierge very kindly allowed my friend (who had left her glasses in Cornwall) to have her glasses sent to them 3 days after we had checked out. We were able to come get them. Very professional people and excellent service!!",5,2017,05,16
120,Beautiful stay,"Beautiful hotel, excellent service, wonderful staff. Room beautiful. Bedding super comfy, great bathroom design. Had a fantastic stay, wish we had time to stay another night! Food in morning did not disappoint either. Loved it!",5,2017,05,16
120,"Very new modern hotel, didn't disappoint","As I understand the hotel is roughly 1 year old and it shows. Everything is still practically brand new. Very modern with bar and restaurant on the ground floor too.
The original room we checked into had a bath/shower combo and for someone who is 6'5"" was never going to work. Fortunately the wonderful front desk staff had some other options and we ended up paying a little more for a bigger room with a separate shower.
The room (719) was a suite with lots of room, spacious bedroom with ensuite that had a bath/shower combo and a separate shower. Even had a view of 'The Shard' from the shower. We had a 2nd toilet separate from the bathroom which was handy and I slept on the sofabed in the living room which was very very comfortable.
Was able to store a couple of drinks in the fridge in the drawer under the TV, with a Tesco and Sainsbury about 50m from the hotel, buying drinks and snacks was very easy.
Closet space is behind a couple of 'hidden' doors in the main corridor. Don't be fooled, there is 3 doors, one is a double door and the other single door is where the safe and ironing board are kept.
The staff here are simply exceptional. Every one I spoke to was outstanding and would always go above and beyond to assist. Front desk staff were amazing, the concierge guys were some of the best I've encountered, and the cleaning staff were friendly and did a great job.",4,2017,05,16
120,Best hotel I have stayed at in London,"I have travelled to london many times and like trying different hotels this was the best so far and I wouldn't hesitate returning.
We stayed in a junior suite and it was excellent it also entitles you to free drinks/food in the executive lounge which is a bonus.Staff are excellent.Would definitely stay again ",5,2017,05,15
120,Excellent service,"From the time we checked in to the time we checked out nothing was too much trouble for the staff.

 Tate Modern.  The Millenial Bridge is right behind the museum. You are walking distance to one of Gordon Ramsey's restaurant.  Conveniently located to the Metro.",5,2017,05,15
120,Amazing Stay,We were highly impressed with this hotel and our stay.  The location is great behind the Tate Modern with plenty of food and stores around.  We got a king room which for London was well sized with a nice size bathroom as well.  Great customer service!  We got turn down service which was an unexpected nice surprise our first night as we were exhausted from our travel day.  The breakfast buffet was delicious and generous.  The room was quiet and we slept amazingly between the quiet rooms and amazing blackout curtains!  The room was clean and the bed comfortable.  I highly recommend this hotel and would definitely go back if in London!,5,2017,05,15
120,Fabulous Hotel,"Book a room with the executive lounge!  Fabulous amenities.  The breakfast is wonderful.  They will fix anything you would like.  Eggs, bacon, ham,fresh fruit, pastries, coffee, tea, the list is endless.  They also have tea & sweets in the afternoon and drinks with a light meal in the evening.  All complimentary!  But, the most impressive food amenity is that they stock complimentary snacks in you suite for you as well.  I am a diamond hilton honors member and travel often all over the world  I would highly recommend this hotel as one of the best Hiltons I have stayed at.",5,2017,05,15
120,"Fab hotel, great location and amazing food","Stayed here a while ago but never got around to writing up my review. The hotel is gorgeous and so clean! The staff are great, the rooms very comfortable and they do the best breakfast of any Hilton I've ever stayed in. Would definitely recommend this hotel to someone staying in London. ",5,2017,05,15
120,Perfect in every way,We stayed here 5 nights after finalizing a 92 day cruise and before returning home.  We could not have been more pleased. We love this location and the staff and accommodations were exceptional. Would definitely return and recommend! We paid extra for a deluxe king--but the price was fair and it was a good decision!,5,2017,05,15
120,Remains excellent,"This a review of a stay for business purposes, in an executive room, for 4 nights, over a weekend.

Booking: Use of the Hilton app is easy, and enabled me to to book my room quickly. I needed to add extra nights and extra rooms as time progressed - on contacting the hotel, they were very helpful in ensuring I had the same room for all 4 nights and that a colleague could stay in the other room I had booked. My only suggestion for improvement is that they could have merged my stay into one receipt for the whole weekend (rather than one for each booking). E-Check-In was excellent and enabled me to choose my room.

Service: As ever, the staff provided friendly and courteous service. Everyone from chambermaid to manager made sure to say hello with a smile and requests for extra glasses and ice were acted upon very quickly.

Room: Spacious, with well designed lighting, the room was a delight. The bed was a dream to sleep in. The minibar was full of treats and tea and coffee supplies were ample. The bathroom was divine, with a rainfall shower and a separate, fast filling bath (not all rooms have baths, but rooms ending in -19 do have one). My only gripe is that the TV signal could be better - occasional glitches whilst watching it.

Executive lounge: What a pleasure. Really good quality food and drink. Hot and cold food served from 5 30 to 7 30, with afternoon tea offering too. Staff more than happy to get food from the main restaurant to order. In fact, the executive lounge staff are just all round amazing - great service.

Main restaurant: Really good selection at breakfast. Eggs to order, the only thing to improve would be to have eggs benedict available with the general breakfast (or even just hollandaise sauce on request). 
We also enjoyed the sunday roast with bottomless prosecoo - again, this was excellent.

Overall: A wonderful hotel which I recommend to my friends (who have universally gone on to love it). A few minor tweaks to take it from excellent to perfect.",5,2017,05,15
120,Nothing too much trouble,"We stayed her for one night before The BAFTAS
This hotel certainly deserves its 5 star rating,from the minute we arrived to be greeted with an iced lemonade nothing was too much trouble!
Beautifully appointed room and public areas with a special mention to Per on the front desk who was absolutely charming.

120,Great place to stay.,"We stayed for 7 nights at the Hilton London Bankside, our first time in London. Our room was spacious and modern.  We didn't have a view at all, but this didn't detract from our stay.  Our booking included breakfast which was brilliant.  Wide variety of delicious food, great service.
The people at Concierge were very helpful and gave us the info we needed so we could get where we needed to go, especially via the nearby Southwark station. 
Would definitely stay at this hotel again.  Loved it.",5,2017,05,15
120,Probably... ...definitely the best Hilton I've stayed at!,Well this the twenty fifth Hilton stay this year and i can confirm that this is the best Hilton I've experienced by far.  All of the staff were outstanding and professional which added with the quality of the rooms and facilities made this a pleasurable break.  I have to point out a few stars in the entourage with Per on the front desk establishing a high level of professionalism and also friendliness and also to Greg in the executive lounge both added to the over all experience.  This will be my preferred hotel in London from now onward.,5,2017,05,15
120,beautifully appointed,"fantastic guest rooms, really well designed and fitted, very quiet and comfortable and a great location right by Blackfriars bridge. My only niggle was that the two staff handling checkout on Saturday Morning were struggling to keep up with the level of demand so a queue built up which was annoying but overall a great hotel and good staff",5,2017,05,14
120,Fantastic weekend stay,"Stayed at the bankside this weekend room 205. Im a hilton employee so like to stay in hilton propities when possible but can honestly say this is the best hotel ive stayed in its modern clean and the staff very friendly and deal with your everyneed cant fault it booked to come back in sept cant wait.

120,Absolutely Fabulous In Every Way,"I am a regular visitor to London and as someone who is loyal to the Hilton brand, I have had my fair share of stays at various Hilton properties across the Capital over the years and even had my favourite property. That all changed when I stayed at Hilton London Bankside for the first time and I can honestly say that this is my new favourite property by far and we will be staying here from now on. 

The staff are absolutely phenomenal and they could not do enough for my boyfriend and I. It started from the moment we checked in. We were checked in very quickly and efficiently. We received an upgrade to a one bedroom king suite due to my status with Hilton Honors and that was an absolutely lovely surprise. The entire property is still fairly new and the decor is modern and appealing. Our suite was very spacious and well appointed. We had a well stocked mini bar in which all snacks and non alcoholic drinks were complimentary and were replenished daily. The bathroom was huge and had the rain shower that I so love. The bed was by far the most luxurious and comfortable bed we have ever slept in at any Hilton property.

We took breakfast in the restaurant in the mornings. The selection had everything you could wish for and more. I was thrilled that they had the same house made granola that the other Hilton property that I had stayed in the past also had. The pastries were out of this world too. The executive lounge was by far the best one ever out of all the Hiltons we have stayed in. The staff in the lounge were so attentive. One member in particular (Sylvia, I believe was her name) always anticipated our needs and took care of us with a smile and professionalism. There was an impressive assortment of cakes, scones, and sandwiches for afternoon tea in the lounge as well as an impressive assortment of canapés and alcoholic beverages in the evening. The lounge provided an oasis of comfort and tranquility. 

We had nightcaps at The Distillery and had a fantastic time. We are both Gin Tonic lovers so the extensive selection of gins did not disappoint. Music at the bar was contemporary and fun. All in all, a very chic and trendy place to be. Loved it!

The staff and property absolutely exceeded our expectations. The only thing that I was sad about was that I did not book this property sooner. We're already planning our next stay. As I said before, this will be our new go-to Hilton property in London. Special thanks to the entire staff for making this stay so special and memorable. Looking forward to our next stay.",5,2017,05,12
120,Good hotel in good location,"Smart, modern hotel in the Bankside area. Reception and check out were smooth and efficient. Bathroom was on the small side but the shower was pretty good. I didn't eat at the hotel but had one drink in the bar which was nice enough. 

I would happily stay here again if I wanted to be in that part of London but wouldn't make a special trip for it.",4,2017,05,12
120,Very good hotel with very good transport links.,"We stayed at this hotel because of a business meeting nearby, but I would not hesitate to recommend this hotel to anyone visiting London that did not want to pay for the excess charges in the West End of London.",5,2017,05,11
120,"Hilton Bankside: it was ""OK"" . . .","I guess I simply had higher expectations for my stay at the Hilton Bankside.  With that being said, the property is still a reasonable option for the Borough of Southwark.

I originally booked my reservation three or four months before my arrival.  Rates were very competitive for what is listed as a “5 star” property in London.  Beforehand, I did request a particular room configuration through the reservations department.  Although it took a few days, I did receive confirmation of a specific type of room.

The Hilton Bankside is conveniently located within a quick 5 minute walk of the Southwark Station.  From Heathrow, it’s a relatively simple process taking the Piccadilly line to Green Park and then the Jubilee line to Southwark.  Within a minute’s walk from the hotel, there are multiple convenience stores including a Tesco Express, a Sainsbury’s, and a Co-op.  Obviously, there are numerous restaurants nearby as well.

Upon arrival at the Hilton, check-in was a little challenging.  Although I did arrive an hour before the official check-in time of 3:00 pm, I was cautiously optimistic I would be accommodated since I was arriving from overseas.  Well, as seems to be typical with London hotels (the same thing has happened to me the last half dozen or so visits), I was told my room would not be ready until 3:00 pm.  Sure, not optimal, but not unexpected either based on several previous trips in the last few years to London.  Unfortunately, my request for a specific room type was not available for the first night even though I had written confirmation from the reservations department from several months prior.  They offered to put me in a higher category room if I paid the difference.  Again, maybe it is just my experience, but I was taken aback that they would not just place me in that upgraded room which, truthfully, does not really cost the hotel anything but builds customer loyalty over time.  Passing on the added expense, they did assure me the room requested would be available the next day.

The room I actually reserved was reasonably comfortable with a large king size bed, desk with chair, fairly large television, and the usual amenities.  Peculiarities included the placement of the hair dryer in a lacquer box next to the door which is about as far away from the bathroom as possible.  Of course, I also noticed there are no regular outlets in the bathroom.  I suspect the general public cannot be trusted with something as dangerous as an electrical outlet in a hotel bathroom in the Borough of Southwark.   There was no stationary for correspondence found.  The toiletries were inconsistently replenished.  Maid service and turn town service were all over the board.  For example, after I left in the morning one day and left the “Service Requested” signage on the doorknob, I was surprised to see my room still had not been cleaned by almost dinnertime.  Individually, none of these issues are particularly distressing, however, it does make me think that the property simply does not reach the level of a premium hotel.

The hotel does include an indoor pool with attached whirlpool as well as an adjacent exercise room.  The pool is not warm specifically in the area of the whirlpool.  So, I have to say that I was not very relaxed after using the pool.  The exercise room was modest and crowded during peak hours.  A reasonable mix of equipment was included.  Again, curiously, the wipes used to clean the machines were completely dry and essentially useless.  So, I ended up bring my own hand sanitizer to the fitness facility whenever I used it.  Again, it was just suboptimal for a hotel competing against other premium properties.

One final issue was a billing error noted at check-out.  I was unable to get it resolved in a timely manner as I was heading to Heathrow and just decided to cut my losses, so to speak.  Regardless, the composite experience at the Hilton Bankside was “fine” but nothing I would specifically repeat unless other options were not available.  The other hotel I considered for this trip was the St. James' Court, A Taj Hotel.  I do wonder if that experience would have been more enjoyable with fewer issues.  Perhaps next time.  As somebody who travels the globe (with dozens of reviews on Trip Advisor), this stay cannot be considered anything but ""average"" largely as a result of the particulars of the hotel and its staff.",3,2017,05,10
120,Perfect,"Everything that could've been great was great. Amazing location, staff, services, food, room and facilities. Would definitely stay here again and would recommend to anyone looking to stay in a luxury hotel in London. ",5,2017,05,10
120,Excellent hotel,"This was our second stay at the Hilton Bankside.  It is a fantastic hotel.  All the staff greet you and the level of service is superb.  The bed was really comfy and our room was really well appointed - we had a suite. 

This time around, I could actually use the mirror whilst seated when drying my hair!

Breakfast is fabulous - omelettes, eggs and waffles are all cooked to order and the accompaniments are excellent.  The breads and pastries are some of the best I've seen and there is a wide choice of different foods.  The dining room staff are attentive and friendly.  The only minor thing I would change would be to have better bread than the bog standard, square, sliced stuff by the conveyer toaster.

It's convenient for public transport and there is good choice of restaurants and bars within walking distance.",5,2017,05,09
120,Bankside,"A great business hotel.  Efficient staff, good facilities, nice rooms! Now my preferred stay in London.  Staff always friendly and a very good Executive Lounge  Location also very convenient for Bankside, Borough Market, The Shard etc.  Restaurants nearby too",5,2017,05,09
120,Executive!,"I just love this Hotel!
Booked an Executive room for 2 nights and requested a ""walk-in"" shower. The hotel contacted me to ask if I had any further requests or needs. I explained that it was just a matter of choice and not a physical requirement, I cannot abide sitting in cooling water with skin getting crinkled!!
Room was a delight, very cleverly laid out. Bed linen was excellent, feather pillows and duvet.... oh joy. Why do hotels insist on buying those awful ""plastic"" duvets that feel as if one is sleeping under a door??! The bathroom, with large shower, was gorgeous. 
With your Exec room comes access to the Exec Lounge. Here there is all day coffee, soft drinks and snacks. 5 to 7pm Tapas are served and drinks served until 8pm. It is a lovely relaxing spot to come to, any time of day or evening. There is also the option to have breakfast here as opposed to the larger dining room. 
This is definitely a return to Hotel. PS staff are all so friendly and excellent at their jobs! ",5,2017,05,08
120,Great hotel at prime location,"This was the second time we stayed at the Hilton Bankside. Just as the first time, we were welcomed in a very friendly way and we even got an upgrade (without costs) to a better room than originally booked. The room was spacy and very clean. When we returned late in the evening, housekeeping had laid open the beds and put down slippers. A nice attention!
We could also take refreshments out of the mini bar when we liked to.
The executive lounge is also a very nice one. Enough space to sit down and relax and equally friendly staff.
I certainly will visit this hotel more in the future.",5,2017,05,08
120,Ideal for tourists,"A few minutes’ walk from Southwark tube, which is only a few underground stops from the West End (and even closer to the RV1 bus to the Strand and Covent Garden). Walking distance to the Tate Modern, Borough Market and the Shard. Stylish rooms, with coffee and tea making facilities and a small fridge for guest use, though strangely lacking an iron and ironing board. Good Wi-Fi signal. Rooms are quiet, with little traffic noise. Lovely breakfast, a cut above the average Hilton. Quite a few bars and restaurants in the immediate vicinity though not an area with a busy nightlife (some nearby pubs such as The White Hart close at weekends, or are quiet at weekends).",4,2017,05,07
120,Excellent Choice,"Excellent Hotel I´d like to visit every time again! Very good location near by the city, very friendly and helpful service, very good breakfast and well equipped rooms. We´d only prefered a bar that closes later, but in GB impossible...",5,2017,05,07
120,Only stay here if your convention is held here,"Pros: fairly new hotel with comfy bed.
Cons: *far away from city center in a business district that everything closed down after dark. *front office staff does not care honnor members, and discriminate if you book thru outside channel such as expedia or booking.com. *prison-like room. If your room facing inside you gonna be facing a wall just few feet fr u and ur neighbor and all windows 100% sealed. No natural air flow, 0. *sewage smell coming up from bathroom from time to time even my room is on the 5th floor.* over priced breakfast with non-organic ingredients, extremely low quality choices, everthing is from cans or package, i.e. All jiuces r from can but they dare to label ""fresh"".* concierge lounge offering in par with airport lounges in u.s. Beautifully presented but very limited supplies and again everthing low end. Evening snack is fry chicken nugget thats so greasy, it makes mac nugget looks like gourmet. *only very few rooms offer tubs.* front office nikel and dime on everything. Want a room with tub? Pay extra. Want a room facing outside? Pay extra. Wanna make reservation thru hilton central reservation? Pay £1.5, yes this hilton charge you even you wanna talk to hilton reservation.* for a newly build hotel this size they have the smallest gym ive ever seen with machine from 1980.",1,2017,05,05
120,Best hotel of the trip,"This hotel is located just a short walk from the Tate. Although not in the usual tourist location, we walked almost everywhere - even up to Hyde park. In fact the daily walk on the riverfront was a real highlight of our London trip. 
The hotel itself is almost brand new and it showed in the fixtures and fittings. The room was clean and very spacious. Comfortable bed. Great shower. We were given a room on the first floor and it was so quiet. We did not hear any noise from the neighbouring rooms eventhough the hotel was fully booked.
There is a gymn and indoor heated pool but we didn't get the chance to use these facilities.
There is a Tesco and Sainsbury a few doors down which added to the convenience. The Borough Market and St Paul's Cathedral is also nearby.
I would say for the price we paid, it was value for money.
I said in the title that this was the best hotel of our 3 week trip but it may actually be the best hotel I have stayed in!",5,2017,05,04
120,Nice hotel but no hot water,"I stayed for three nights at this hotel for a conference. I was disappointed that on my first morning the shower was barely lukewarm. I reported it to reception and the following morning I had lovely hot water. However, on the third morning the water was almost cold. I was disgusted.  Breakfast was nice but I was only offered filter coffee on the first morning - which quite frankly I was shocked at. The following morning I discovered that I could help myself to an americano!!!! Not good enough. Lovely variety of food for breakfast but on my last morning I went for breakfast around 10am and lots of food (such as the jars of yogurt) were finished - seems a little crazy that they appear to operate on a first come, first served basis. Breads were not replenished either that morning so very poor selection.  Better hotels available in London for what they charge and then deliver.",3,2017,05,03
120,"omfort, Style & Location at London Hilton Bankside","It was a real pleasure staying at this hotel. The attentive staff, comfortable beds and attention to detail will keep clients coming back. I w as only in town for 2 days on a layover I found easy access to the RV1 bus route on nearby Southwork minutes from the hotel. Via this bus I easily got to the London Eye, Burrough market, the Shard, London Bridge & Tower bridge, to name a few tourist sites. Great location for the Underground as well. I would stay here again on my next visit.",5,2017,05,02
120,Amazing Burgers,The Hotel Restaurant Really Delivers Quality Food For A Nice Price. I been in the hotel for 3 days for an event and the hotel really delivers a high standard for a reasonable price. I recommend this place to others,5,2017,05,01
120,Celebrating 43 years,"This was trip to celebrate my birthday number 43 and it couldn't be better, excellent choice...the hotel is new and the service is perfect...the bed confortable and the bathroom clean and beautiful...the situation of the hotel is near of the subway...100% recommended...",5,2017,05,01
120,Chilled bank holiday ,"I generally love a Hilton anyway, this one is now my new favourite. Good walking distance from Southwark tube station, about 5 minutes. Building modern and staff super friendly. We are 3 university friends that catch up regularly. Had a junior suite which we were offered an upgrade for £50 to a one bedroom suite which was good and had plenty of room! Used pool and had access to executive lounge which was amazing. We were being very lazy and stayed around the hotel for our stay but the lovely atmosphere, good food and friendly staff who made us feel at ease made our stay great. Thank you Hilton bankside will be returning 😀 ",5,2017,05,01
120,Great hotel and staff,"This is a premium hotel with a very high level of rooms and facilities. The staff are great; very friendly and quick to help out where needed. The hotel is situated well for Southwark, Blackfriars and London Bridge which are all around 10 mins walk away.",5,2017,04,30
120,One of the first few great designs spotted in a Hilton and such value for money!,"I read somewhere that we should keep this place hush-hush because it's such a great hotel and provides fabulous value, but I guess that wouldn't be fair to the hotel for all its effort. 

Things I really like about this Hilton:
1. DESIGN - Modern, clean and pretty
2. ACCESSIBILITY - Walking distance to metro station and the Tate Modern

We had a handicap-accessible room, so not much to rave about design of the toilet. BUT, the room is so nicely done up and comfortable... Love this place and would definitely return!",5,2017,04,30
120,Treated like Royalty,"As a Hilton Honors Diamond Member, it was recommended by Hilton that my children and I stay here for our vacation. Well, they were spot on!  I travel quite frequently for work and have never been treated as well during a hotel stay as at the Hilton London Bankside. 
We arrived from the United States at 7am and obviously rooms weren't ready, but they took us to luggage hold, let us get items we needed out to go to spa area to shower and then to Executive Lounge for breakfast. I was pleasantly surprised that one of our 2 rooms was available by about 10am. 
From the front desk check in, to the bell hop to the concierge, everything and everyone was top notch. 
We didn't have to request more towels. They were there. We didn't have to request turndown service (linens turned down, damp mat at each side of bed, bottled water on each nightstand and music set to relaxing station).  It was done. We didn't have to request taxi. It was ready as soon as we came to the lobby. Concierge booked attractions for us and made awesome recommendations for sightseeing. 
We even had a beautiful Easter dessert delivered to the room and treats for the kids. 
The rooms were very well appointed. Even with an umbrella (comes in handy in London). The beds were super plush and comfy, surround sound in bathrooms, lighting was spectacular and bathrooms were luxurious. Hotel was quiet at night so we were able to rest up for the next day. 
We were there for 3 nights and by the first night we were being called by name. They are that personable and attentive. 
The restaurant on site was delicious. We only are breakfast there each day, but the spread was endless and the staff was courteous and professional the food was varied and delicious. Executive lounge (for Hilton Diamond Members) was the nicest I had ever seen in a Hilton property.  It was well-appointed with good and beverage and business services needed. The spa and indoor pool were gorgeous. The location of the Hotel was fine for me. In a quaint little area. Safe to walk around at night. And just a short taxi ride to the middle of London. I will definitely stay at the Hilton London Bankside again and highly recommend anyone else to if you are in London. That's if you like being treated like Royalty!",5,2017,04,29
120,"Modern Hotel, Great Location, Helpful Staff","This is a very nice hotel, located within easy walking distance to many of the major tourist sites. Our room was large, clean, attractive, and comfortable. All staff members encountered were friendly, courteous, and professional.  The staff in the Executive Lounge were extremely helpful and did everything they could to anticipate and meet our needs. I would definitely stay here again!",5,2017,04,27
120,Wedding night,"My husband chose to book this hotel for 2 nights during our wedding weekend. The bed was amazing (big enough to sleep 5) and you have all the privacy you'll need.
Really enjoyed my stay and looking forward to coming back sometime in the future! ",5,2017,04,27
120,Perfection on bankside,"Best trip to London ever, the hotel and the location was absolutely perfect. I would highly recommend Hilton bankside to all, my wife and i was on a short love break but next time we Will definitely bring our daughter (7 years) she would have loved the hotel and services aswell.",5,2017,04,27
120,The finest,"This was my second year to host an event at Hilton Bankside. In addition to providing  a thoroughly professional service to 320 guests a team of event organisers stayed overnight and we cannot rate highly enough the quality of rooms and breakfast. The staff deserve special mention for their friendliness with each of them without exception performing at the highest of standards. Management can be justly proud of their entire team.

The hotel is located close to public transport with the Jubilee Line on the underground just a 5 minute walk to Southwark station. This stop takes you to the heart of the city in 7 minutes.

While we were setting up for our evening event the hotel was buzzing with a regular Saturday Brunch with live musicians and a full house which apparently is the case every weekend.

It's a great venue for events and accommodation. Full marks all round.",5,2017,04,26
120,Great hotel in a great area,"Very satisfactory experience during my first stay at this really cool hotel. I love the area, love the venue. Staff great and smily. The Distillery Bar is stunning and the quality of the deco and materials is fantastic.  Looking forward to come back soon.",5,2017,04,26
120,Amazing stay! ,"My partner and I stayed at the Hilton London Bankside last week for his 30th Birthday.... Our whole stay was amazing staff were friendly & helpful, hotel was clean and just made our whole experience very enjoyable! I'd previously read reviews stating how good the hotel and staff were but it definitely topped expectations! Location was fab for tubes,  über taxi & general public transport. Can not wait to book and stay again. Would definitely recommend! Thank you for an awesome stay Hilton Bankside! P.s best Hilton I have stayed in by far. X ",5,2017,04,25
120,Nice couple visit,"Lovely room and amazing staff. Bedroom is very spacious but the bathroom isn't the best. The shower water easily flows onto the main floor tiles in the bathroom, which means if you shower too long it's a wet mess. Everything was clean and tidy when we got in. Staff where quick and friendly trying to sort an issue was charged for breakfast that we didn't have and they handled the situation amazingly. Would recommend ",4,2017,04,25
120,Brilliant,It is difficult to find fault with this hotel. I will definitely stay here again.  The swimming pool is a good size and the rooms very comfortable. Good selection at breakfast as well with staff who are keen to help.,5,2017,04,24
120,Very good for the price with an excellent exec lounge,"This was my first visit to the Bankside- I stayed with my family in two connecting rooms for four days.  I usually stay on the north bank, so I wasn't sure what to expect, but the property is a very short walk to the river, and less than a 10 minute walk to a large collection of restaurants and bars.  It is also an easy 5-7 minute walk to the Southwark tube stop, and maybe a 12 minute walk to Waterloo train station.

The property is quite new, so the rooms were spacious, well lit, and well furnished.  We were able to access the executive lounge, and I found it to be the best of any hilton property in London, with a great breakfast, a reasonable selection of afternoon treats, and an excellent selection of hot and cold items in the evening accompanied by wine and spirits.  The lounge staff were very friendly, and worked to ensure that we always had what we needed.

We did have one issue with our stay, in the form of an a/c unit that didn't work properly.  The hotel attempted to fix it, but it was never fully fixed during our visit, resulting in a sleepless night.  If not for that, I'd have given this property 5 stars.",4,2017,04,24
120,"Comfortable, Friendly, Great Location","Found the hotel when searching for somewhere near to Borough High St. I used to work a lot round that area but this was a new hotel I had never stayed at before. If it had been available then I would never had stayed anywhere else.

This is a superb hotel with really comfortable, well furnished and technically serviced rooms. The staff are also excellent with a very friendly attitude and who cannot do enough to provide help and a memorable stay.

I was checked in by Hannah (don't know her last name) and her advice and assistance was invaluable and this I think was probably my best check-in experience ever.

Finally, remember to look for the foxes. :-)",5,2017,04,24
120,Mayors Charity Ball ,"Strange location hidden off a side road by a block of council flats, we went for a Charity Ball, well presented inside.  Beautiful decor. The ballroom 1 is where we started off with drinks and it overlooked on a balcony to the main Ballroom 2.   This was set up amazing.  The 3 course meal was superb.  ",4,2017,04,23
120,Nice hotel- well placed,"Good stay and if this is what the ""new "" Hilton looks like it's a sure fire winner on style and decor. 

Only downside was a little stern welcome that made signing in four rooms a little more difficult and frosty than it needed to be. 
However in this case it was not in any way typical of other staff members whom we met who were all lovely ,welcoming and accommodating.

A special mention to floor staff in the bar who served us lovely food. They were superb in every way. 

Decor spot on - rooms lovely. 

Will be back. 

",5,2017,04,22
120,Pleasant Vacation Stay,"Stay was friendly and helpful, and location good for getting to most south bank sites.  10-20 minute taxi ride (due to traffic) to Palace Area or Harrods; while you could walk to either on a nice day.  Borough market is close and worth a walk.

Rooms were clean and spacious for London, and executive lounge for those with status is superb.

Be aware of two things though.  VAT (government tax) is 20% on total bill, and do not ask pay in dollars.  I always ask to pay in Pounds and let my credit card convert, but slipped up here.  As soon as I said ""dollars"" I said ""wait no"" and the women said sorry I already pressed the button and can't cancel it.  The terrible ""convenience"" exchange rate cost me an extra $40 dollars from what the strait conversion would cost.  ",4,2017,04,22
120,Wonderful stay; brilliant staff,"We stayed at Hilton Bankside for 4 nights and had a wonderful stay. The room was clean and a nice size. Being an executive room there was a desk/ workspace which was very convenient for my husband who had to do some work while we were away. Having a comfortable workspace and good internet made doing so much easier. The best choice we made was to book an executive room which meant we had access to the executive lounge. The staff in the executive lounge was excellent. They were happy to do anything possible for every guest. Breakfast choices were wide and varied with excellent pastries, eggs cooked to order, porridge, cheeses and meats, etc. Afternoon tea in the lounge was also very good with very good scones, excellent desserts, and several choices of tea sandwiches. They also offered a cocktail hour in the evening with prosecco, mixed drinks, hors d'oeuvres, etc. 

Location of the hotel was good if you are primarily staying in the area. The Tate is literally a block away, the borough market is within walking distance, and there are several very good restaurants nearby. Two tube stations are within a 7-15 minute walk but we found ourselves having to transfer a stop or two away to get to most destinations. It is certainly easy enough but if someone is in a rush they would want to leave a couple minutes early in case of delays while transferring.

I do unfortunately need to caution people to check their credit card statements after leaving. We were charged $22 for a mini-bar purchase we did not make (16 pounds plus a service charge). It took contacting the main Hilton number and several emails with the manager of the hotel before it was refunded. I understand that mistakes are made but it was an unfortunate and frustrating way to end what was otherwise an excellent stay.

Despite the billing mistake I would definitely return to the Hilton Bankside. We had a very nice stay in London and the hotel and staff were a large part of why it was such a good holiday.",4,2017,04,20
120,Great hotel - central location and terrific service!,"This is one of the nicest Hilton hotels I've stayed at.  It is very convenient in terms of transportation, restaurants, shopping, etc.  We also used the pool, which is part of the beautiful spa.  Highly recommend it!",5,2017,04,19
120,Brilliant service and friendly staff,"We stayed here for two nights on Monday 17th and Tuesday 18th April  2017 . We upgraded to executive rooms and lounge and it was a wonderful stay from start to finish . We enjoyed the swimming pool , the close proximity to Tate and the Globe and eAsy access to all parts of London . Very smart comfortable hotel and the waiter from Hungary in the executive lounge gave us great service . ",5,2017,04,19
120,One of the best Hiltons in England,"This hotel is relatively new.  When I first stayed there, I thought that maybe the excellent service and the focus of the staff on guests was early days enthusiasm.  But I have stayed subsequently including a recent stay, as well as attending corporate events there.  The quality of service has never changed.  The staff are a credit to the GM and the owners.  Other than the Waldorf , which is more expensive, you will not find any Hilton in London or the rest of England",5,2017,04,18
120,Stay at Hilton London Bankside,"My wife and I stayed at the Hilton Hotel Bankside in London. It was a vacation trip and overall the experience was excellent. The staff was very helpful, the morning breakfast was very good, and the room/bed was comfortable and clean. We enjoyed it very much and the location of the hotel was very near a number of attractions such as the Globe Theater and the Imperial War Museum as well.",5,2017,04,18
120,Good addition to the Hilton family,"We decided to give this Hilton a try over Easter and were impressed. From the reception staff to the concierge and staff in the Exec lounge everyone was very helpful, professional and friendly.
The hotel is very near to Tate Modern and close to the SouthBank (National theatre, London Eye, Festival theatre, Borough Market, London Bridge and Tower Bridge) so is a great location. You are also just a few minutes walk from Southwark underground station so it's easy to get around.
As the hotel has only been open for about a year everything works and the rooms are well appointed. On this basis we'll certainly be staying here again.",4,2017,04,18
120,Easter holiday stay,"We stayed at Hilton Bankside in an executive room. We loved the fantastic location - within 5min walk from Southwark station (jubilee line) and about 8 min from the City (just behind Tate modern). 

The whole hotel has a modern décor creating very pleasant relaxing atmosphere all the way through. It is well maintained and cleaned at all times. 

Our room was large. Even with an extra bed for our daughter we had a great amount of space. The bed was very, very comfortable with high quality bedding. The whole room and bathroom was spotless and very well equipped. 

I was well impressed by all the staff hospitality, very attentive and went out of their way to help. Welcome pack for children was much appreciated. Our daughter felt like a princess with all the attention she got…. And in fact, if that was up to her our London visit would consist of staying in the hotel and enjoying its comforts. 

The pool was yet another great selling point for us. Relaxing, warm, clean fantastic way to start and finish the day…

Executive lounge is also top star. From staff to food to décor. 

Exceptional service and standards of the hotel, created by staff that clearly care.  We had a fantastic stay and we’ll certainly be staying there again.",5,2017,04,18
120,Good surprise!,"Nice hotel, well located, with a incridible breakfast and a very good restaurant if you need! The roons are large and calm! Everything was very clean and confortable. I just dislike the smell of the loby, it was to strong for me. I realy enjoy my faster stay!",5,2017,04,17
120,Easter weekend visit,Short walk from the tube. Friendly staff. Nice breakfast buffet with cooked to order hot dishes. A nice executive lounge with afternoon tea and evening canapes. Small pool and gym in basement.  Lots of small touches which made for a very pleasant visit. Housekeeping was outstanding! All in all made for a nice London stay!,5,2017,04,17
120,Bar and staff are excellent,I have stayed in a very high number of hotels all over the world and the bar staff in this Hilton are some of the best I have ever seen. I think they have a very good manager in the bar area and that makes a big difference.,5,2017,04,17
120,Excellent hotel,"Firstly, the staff here are amazing. They cannot do enough for you and everyone I came across was happy and welcoming. Just wander through the lobby and 2 or 3 staff will go out of their way to help you with something, the same in the restaurant. This is an extremely well managed hotel. The rooms are very nice as is the bar and restaurant. We did not use the pool/spa area. Breakfast is very good - can they cook scrambled egg? Nearly...  Anyway stay here for the staff and they way you are looked after. Also great location just 5 mins walk to the river.",5,2017,04,17
120,Social Stay ,"I stayed here on Good Friday with some friends as we had a gig near by. The welcome at the reception was warm and very friendly. Check in was speedy. I was pleasantly surprised at how nice the rooms were, very spacious. One thing I really liked was the plug sockets they were quite a few scattered around the room. When I stay in hotels I do find that there are only a couple and in an inconvenient place. The room we were in had some by the bed both sides and by the TV/table area. The bathroom was lovely again spacious and a shower that was so nice I did not want to leave. I think the whole place has been made and designed bery well. And the staff make the stay even more enjoyable. I always feel more settled in a hotel when the staff are welcoming. There honestly isn't anything I could fault about my stay. ",5,2017,04,16
120,"Excellent location, great standard of hotel","Easy to find,5 minute walk from Southwark tube and therefore very close to The Cut and Waterloo. This is by far my favoured side of town,on top of the river, The Tate, walk east or west along the river and not at all touristy. Lovely little spots for breakfast on Union Street too. Hotel had really friendly,helpful unpretentious welcome,which is not always the case in a high end hotel.Rooms were spotless with excellent facilities and free water. Good quality towels, gowns and bedding. Even though we were at the back by train line,it was quiet. Another miracle was the fact the room temperature was just right. Will come again, hope it is soon!",5,2017,04,16
120,Clean and Nice Hotel,"Had a trip with my friend. Excellent to walk to sightseeing locations. The staffs are nice and helpful. Room is quite, clean and modern. However, a bit (5 to 7 mins) far away from underground. As location at business area, surrounding is quite at night.",5,2017,04,16
120,"Still going strong, mostly","This was our second stay here in a year, six months apart. For 5 nights this time. The Apex Temple Court had been our favorite for some time but has recently become more expensive, as part of American Airlines Vacations, than the Bankside. We were drawn to the Bankside by the good reviews, location, price, it was relatively new, and it had a pool (which the Apex does not). For us, the pool proved not to be appealing as it is in a hot and humid basement (see the One Aldwych for a superior pool, sauna, and steam facility). We do however appreciate and enjoy the design aesthetic, efficient air conditioning, quiet, and size of the Bankside guest rooms. One niggle with our room this visit was a gap in the shower flooring that resulted in a dank, musty odor when first entering the room. This was not a deal breaker and we did not register a complaint during our stay. I did report it in a email survey from the hotel and they replied with an apology and assurance that the problem would be dealt with immediately. We will return if the price is right.",4,2017,04,16
120,Excellent ,"Not the most obvious location but really handy for Blackfriars Station on the Thameslink so in easy reach from Kings Cross / St Pancras. 
Good for the South Bank, reasonable stroll for Borough Market etc.
Hotel is lovely. Very modern, very chic. A few five star hotels I've stayed in could learn from the design styling.
Will repeat the stay without a second thought.",5,2017,04,15
120,Wonderful Hotel in a fantastic location,We had really lovely 3 day stay here.  The Hotel is in a great location just behind the Tate Modern offering easy access to central London and walks along the banks of the Thames.  Choice and variety of breakfast items was superb.,5,2017,04,14
120,"Great location, lovely hotel",Stayed for two nights. We were upgraded to an executive room on the sixth floor which was big by London standards. A stones throw from Tate modern. Lots of lovely eateries near by. The hotel was comfortable and quiet at night and the staff were very helpful. The hotel bar had a good range of gins and table service.. I would stay here again..,5,2017,04,12
120,Brilliant experience!,"We stayed in Bankside in order to explore a different part of London. It was great to find that the hotel was very close to Tate Modern, the river and had easy access to taxis. Unfortunately, the car parking facility seemed somewhat mysterious, we were charged £40 per day and the car was taken away after signing a waiver to state owner's risk etc. The executive lounge was a lovely amenity and good for relaxation. The interior is beautiful, specifically the bar and restaurant.",4,2017,04,12
120,Top notch hotel with great amenities,"Let me the 4 star rating out of the way. I deducted 1 star because of its location. Most of our travels were around the other side of the river so it wasn't as centrally located for what we did.

Now for the good part. 
Contemporary hotel with excellent accommodations. Staff was friendly at check-in, daily and check-out.  The room was spacious.  We had a handicap accessible room so the bathroom was enormous because there were no doors inside the bathroom.  The sink, shower and toilet was just all there.  Very different but it wasn't a problem for a couple.  We loved the shower heads that can be switched from hand shower to rain shower.

The indoor heated pool was great after a long day of bing a tourist.  My only qualm about this facility was the spa entrance is inside the pool which means the spa water temperature isn't hotter than the pool temp. 

Free wifi and always up a don running so we were able to use internet and call to the states via VOIP. 

Hotel had some local pubs in the neighborhood as well as local eateries and coffee shops. Underground metro was about 10 mins away. 

If staying here, be sure to walk to the Borough Market which is close by.  great open air farmer's market 

",4,2017,04,11
120,Have Already Booked My Next Stay!,"My objective in booking this hotel was to find an alternative to the sterile hotels in Canary Wharf, though by necessity, the alternative couldn't be too far into Central London - this is it!  This is a gem of a hotel - located on Great Suffolk St., it is only 5 minutes walk from Southwalk tube (so therefore only 4 stops from Canary Wharf), yet it also has an abundance of restaurants and bars all within 5-10 minutes - as well the Globe Theatre, Clink Prison and the Golden Hind, all very close too.  My room was very quiet and very comfortable; the gym was small but has all basic equipment and as an added plus, there is also an enclosed pool.  Finally, the staff were all very attentive and professional - very impressed with everyone and everything about this hotel.  Thank you.",5,2017,04,11
120,Awesome new  5-star Hilton,"Clean, Modern and friendly. Staff couldn't be more helpful. The only complaint I could come up with is room 253 had badly mis-applied wallpaper and was very wrinkled and shoddy. Otherwise, a nice new hotel in a good location. ",5,2017,04,09
120,Incredible design and service,"Two words – Executive Lounge. WOW. This Hilton is honestly the nicest property I have stayed at.

The service was impeccable from the first moment we arrived to when we checked out and got in a cab. The Front Desk Guest Service Manager [name] was very helpful during checkin and throughout our stay.

The location is not in the center of london, but it is very convenient and easy to get everywhere in the city.",5,2017,04,08
120,Very nice hotel,"Stayed 8 nights on vacation, and were glad that we chose the Hilton Bankside.  Décor and atmosphere in the hotel was stylish and modern, but also warm and inviting.  Room was comfortable, with large bathroom and great shower.  Plenty of outlets(including one that didn't even need an adapter for US style plugs.).  Room was well lit (although confusing light switches - note the ""night light"" switch next to the bed doesn't control the actual bedside nightlight, but the nighttime lighting in the bathroom.  Importantly, our room was very quiet (7th floor, facing north toward the Tate Modern).  Heard no traffic noise whatsoever.   Put out your ""do not disturb, though, because the minibar refill man comes early in the morning.  Housekeeping did a great job.

Location is really good.  Southwark tube is about 5-6 minute walk.  Slightly longer walk to London Bridge stop.  Lots of restaurants within 2-3 minutes of hotel, and many more if you'll walk 6-8 minutes.  Streets were never crowded, but usually people around and always felt safe at night.

Ate some breakfasts at the on-site restaurant.  Buffet style, plus eggs and omelets made to order.  Really nice ambience with great food.  Well worth booking a breakfast included room.  (Turned out we got complimentary access as Hilton Gold, which is above average perk for Gold status.  Much better than at any other Hilton I've ever stayed at.)

Also booked executive club room, but that turned out not to be worth it because we didn't get to use it enough.  Nicely furnished club.  Breakfast was good, but atmosphere in the restaurant is nicer.  Never made it to their tea time at the executive club - were also out and about sightseeing.  Hit the happy hour a few times.  Food choices for happy hour were disappointing.  Mystery items that weren't labelled, and where the servers didn't know what they were either. 

Overall a great choice, and probably my favorite HIlton that I've ever stayed at.  I've found international (non-US) hotels in any of the Hilton brands tend to overpromise and underdeliver.  This was precisely the reverse.",5,2017,04,08
120,Wonderfull experience,"I just don't have any negative remarks. This hotel is a great experience. Friendly staff, excellent breakfast - restaurant - bar and sleeping accomodation. I love this hotel! Stay at 'Hilton Bankside' for a real nice stay in London.",5,2017,04,08
120,Rare Find in London,The accommodation was great. We were upgraded (HH diamond) and the lounge and breakfast are really delicious with ample well prepared and cook to order food. The service was terrific- wonderful staff and helpful concierge. This place is a total find! I would not hesitate in booking Hilton Bankside. We found the location to be very convenient.,5,2017,04,07
120,Fabulous in every way ,"I have stayed at Hilton Hotels around the world and nothing compares to this one. 
Such a lovely greeting by Jan at reception and John, thank you for the taxi this morning. 
Once you enter the beige brick building, you will have a very pleasant surprise. 
This hotel was fabulous in all areas: The club lounge food and drinks (definitely worth paying the extra), the great warm I sort pool, the breakfast, the linen, the shower and the lovely accommodating staff. 
I highly recommend this hotel.  ",5,2017,04,07
120,Highly recommended,Great hotel with beautiful rooms. Staff were very friendly and helpful. Close to southwark tube station so very conveniently located. We got the solute which came with access to the executive lounge for breakfast and afternoon tea. Very nice breakfast and great to not have to go out to find a place to eat in the morning. Afternoon tea was perfect for our late afternoon arrival after an 11 hour flight. Staff were very accommodating. ,5,2017,04,06
120,Faultless! Luxurious contemporary hotel for the discerning,"Loved our experience at this wonderful hotel.  The décor was very warm and appealing, contemporary and stylish. Bedrooms, have true King size beds that are super comfortable, and we loved the finishing touches such as full mirrors in wardrobes (that light up when you open them), plenty of plugs. bathroom with huge shower and choice of two shower heads. (For us this was like home from home!).  Staff very friendly and helpful and both the bar and the restaurant have good food and a huge selection of beers and spirits.",5,2017,04,05
120,Great value,"Decided to try this hotel following a conference.  We'd stayed at Waldorf Hilton several times so thought we'd give this a go.  Nice, modern, new hotel.  It is less expensive than Waldorf and the Executive lounge access is definitely worth the extra.  Breakfasts very good, afternoon tea, adequate.  Evening canapés okay, free alcohol excellent.    Pleasantly surprised to find non-alcoholic beverages and snacks in mini-bar all 'free'!  That potentially saves a lot of money!  Swimming pool looked nice but didn't go in.  Good location for Tate modern, St Paul's, Borough market, Shard, etc.  But too far to walk to main shopping areas, e.g. Regent's street.  Southwark Tube 0.3 miles away.",5,2017,04,05
120,One word....,Fantastic! We traveled to London for the weekend with my girlfriend and it was her 30th birthday. Alex Frank the manager at Hilton Bank side made this birthday even better thanks to him. The rooms at this hotel is so nicely designed and everything is so fresh and clean. Good service and smiling staff working at this hotel. The breakfast was delicious and the hotel has it own pool that is open until 22:00 pm every day. This hotel at Bank Side is very close to everything. It is only two station away from Green Park. If you want value for you money then this is the hotel to stay in London. Me and my girlfriend would definitely come back. ,5,2017,04,05
120,New Gem close to Tate Modern,The hotel opened a year ago and not only is the accommodation excellent the staff would get a rating of 11 exceeding a max available of 10 - they were that good! We stayed there for 14 nights - the only criticism was the lack of drawer space for clothes. ,5,2017,04,02
120,Outstanding!,Simply first class in every way. Repeat guests here & made to feel so welcome by all the staff. Big thank you to Anna who made this stay extra special. The one bed suites are absolutely stunning with a great view of the Shard & free (non alcoholic) minibar. Everything finished to the highest standard. Beautiful executive lounge & a great breakfast spread. Lovely cocktails served up in the Distillery bar - all served with a smile (with Adrian serving up some specials that were not on the menu - a lovely touch). Superb location 5 mins from Southwark station. Absolutely faultless stay - a real birthday treat (with a beautiful complimentary chocolate cake sent to the room as well). Being a Diamond Honors member having stayed in many different Hiltons this is up there as one of the best. Will definitely return soon & recommend to anyone looking to stay in London!,5,2017,04,02
120,Best hilton ever,Best hilton ever stayed! Very clean and location is great too.  The decoration is super cool and we really love the stay.  Everywhere is super clean and we will definitely stay here again next time in london. ,5,2017,04,01
120,Amazing Executive Lounge,Gianluca was spectacular in his customer service.  We really enjoyed the executive lounge during our recent convention attendance at Hilton Bankside. Thank you to the crew that looked after us.  The entire property is very well run and well maintained.  If we travel to London again we will be back! ,5,2017,03,31
120,True 5 Star Service! Extremely Service Oriented and Friendly!,"Recently spent a week in London, England and stayed at the Hilton London Bankside Hotel. I've never stayed at a better hotel! The rooms were cleaned thoroughly everyday, the hotel itself is brand new and the aesthetics are modern and comforting. 
By far THE BEST STAFF at any hotel I've ever been at, bar none. The management picks qualified and genuinely caring & outgoing people that provide exceptional service to clients. Specifically, the shift manager, Céline La Fontaine Libihoul- so extremely helpful in helping us solidify our tourism plans, referred us to the best restaurants London has to offer of all different cuisines and greeted us every chance we walked through the lobby. She never hesitated to help us with any questions or needs we had! 
The location of the Hilton London Bankside is perfect for tourism because its a short walk to BlackFriar's Bridge, the Thames and all the amazing historical landmarks. 
The in-house restaurant, bar and their wait staff are also truly awesome! 
I would stay there again without hesitation.",5,2017,03,31
120,Excellent staff in hotel and OXBO restaurant,"This is a great place to stay in London
Reasonable price.  Great Location and in walking distance of a lot of good areas.  Fantastic staff- so friendly, attentive and helpful.  Good rooms.  Fabulous OXBO restaurant.
Thotoughly recommend this place",5,2017,03,30
120,Great business hotel,"Stayed for 2 night during a business function which was hosted in the hotel.
The room was spacious, well decorated and with a great layout for business use (Desk, electricity etc). Staff was professional and gracious, breakfast was good and all in all i had a very pleasant stay.
The area is not my favorite in London but would definitely stay there again",4,2017,03,30

120,Best Hilton in London,"Definitely the best Hilton in London.
Good location, large rooms, proper large showers, well decorated, clean, good gym, pool looks good (not tried).

Best food in Executive lounge and lounge has character.

But most of all friendliest most helpful staff",5,2017,03,27
120,Perflect blend of comfort and efficiency,Great experience staying at the Hilton London Bankside for business last week. All of the staff were helpful regardless of department and all worked together seamlessly to deliver what was a pleasant and comfortable stay.,5,2017,03,27
120,Good value for money!,"Immaculate, fantastic staff, brilliant breakfast and - for London - really good value for money. A frequent choice when we're in the city. Plus it's very conveniently located.

Couldn't believe it was a Hilton. Definitely doesn't have the chain-like feel.",5,2017,03,26
120,Amazing visit! ,"My boyfriend took me to the Hilton for my 18th birthday! The hotel is located so close to everything and only a 5 min walk to the tube station. The room was outstanding and supplied everything you need, staff are very friendly and helpful, overall a very good hotel.",5,2017,03,26
120,"Lovely hotel, terrible view","The staff were all extremely friendly and welcoming. The room was very comfortable and all the amenities were great. 

It was disappointing though to open my curtains and be looking straight onto an air conditioning unit. It was also disappointing to find that my mini bar was not stocked. I queried this and was told that rooms of my category only have water in the mini bar. I booked through booking.com so I wonder if Hilton treats these bookings as second class guests? 

Otherwise a great stay - the hotel is in a great location and I really enjoyed my stay. ",4,2017,03,25
120,Great Hotel!!!,"This is a high end hotel, we stayed in a Business Suite which was what we needed for a few business meetings we held there, however the price was just extremely high. The service and facilities were top notch, great customer service and perfect location to move around London. The concierge was extremely helpful and attentive, all staff was also very good. The business lounge was incredibly pleasant, I wish I had had more time to spend there. Hopefully I will return but I would try to get a better rate.  The view from the room was none.",5,2017,03,19
120,"Great hotel, great location","Stayed for the weekend, arrived and checked in quickly. Room a good size, clean and nice toiletries. Bed really comfortable. Location is fantastic, under 5 min walk to Southwark tube. Lots of places to eat and close to borough market. Breakfast was excellent and standard was as it should be for Hilton brand. Room service food was a little disappointing considering the price but the speed it was delivered was good. Overall a lovely base for our weekend in London.",5,2017,03,19
120,A little gem! ,"Just returning home from a fabulous 24 hour stay at this hotel. Cannot fault it in any way. From the moment we walked through the door, to the moment we left, the service was impeccable. The hotel is very welcoming, ambient and incredibly clean. We had an executive twin (room 315) and it was one of the larger ones, with a corner sofa in. Great shower, comfy beds and air con. The executive lounge has an excellent choice of food and snacks throughout the day and the alcohol selection in the evening is great. We also had a 3 course dinner included in our room rate and the food was beautifully cooked. The breakfast in the main restaurant was truly excellent - by far the best buffet breakfast I have had in a Hilton - please don't change anything here! All in all, a wonderful stay and I will be returning! I've been racking my brains for niggles and the only things I can come up with are:
Turndown service offered too early at 4.45pm
You can't see the tv from the sofa in the bedroom - poor design. 
The relief kit in the mini bar - £10 if you forget your toothbrush, paracetamol etc. Seemed a bit cheap in such a superior hotel! 
Anyway - if these are the biggest faults, then there really are no big issues here! Hope hotel manages to keep up to these amazing standards! A lovely, relaxing weekend! ",5,2017,03,19
120,"Excellent hotel, I will be back!","I am on the road 60-100 nights each year and generally stay at Hilton properties.  This trip to London, though, had me in a quandary as my last few tips to London I had been disappointed in the quality of the places I'd stayed.  Based on some comments from colleagues in the local office, this wasn't unusual.

No more.  This property was outstanding.  Already looking forward to coming back a time or three, both for business and hopefully in the fall for pleasure.  It's a nice area, with easy access to the Southwark tube (5 minute walk, although I wouldn't want to drag a big suitcase over these pavements), a couple of minute's walk to Tate Modern, and 25 minutes walk over the Millennium Bridge to the far side of St.Paul's.  I had a nice walk along the Thames down to Tower Bridge, and home through Borough Market once I'd worked up an appetite.

I am a diamond member so had access to the executive lounge.  Snacks all day, extensive hors d'ouvre, and a very decent breakfast array.  Scrambled eggs are very undercooked, but I gather that's the British way.  

My room was an upgrade to a suite, but I assume the beds are the same in all, and it was extremely comfortable, great pillows, with a still very fluffy comforter.  Turn down service and maid service were impeccable.  I had supervisors come in to double check the room.  Only quibble I had was convincing them to take the tip I left each day.  It may not be the usual thing in the UK, but I was living all over my suite and thought it appropriate.  I've not had someone ignore my thank you note and cash before!

Minibar snacks and non-alcoholic drinks included? That's not happened anywhere else I can recall on my travels.  And much appreciated.

I used the restaurant and room service, and was pleased each time.  Very good food, well prepared, and very friendly service.   There are lots of restaurants nearby, including Gordon Ramsey's latest, which I was able to get into one night.  Also highly recommended.

Everyone was extremely friendly, all the time.  From arrival to departure, I felt that they actually cared that I had chosen to stay there.  There were a couple of little glitches like a misplaced parcel, but they corrected the problem and took responsibility for it.  I can't ask more than that, stuff happens.

Thanks for a great stay.  This Hilton is a top representative of the brand.",5,2017,03,19
120,Premium service near Southwark offices,"I chose the hotel for it was nearby my office. I've never been in this part of London, but it turned out it was also near attractive leisure zones full of pubs and restaurants. London centre is at distance walk (20 - 30 min).  About the hotel, room service meals are a little bit expensive for the value, but the qualities of the room are fantastic.",4,2017,03,19
120,Appalling Customer Service,"I booked my visit through booking .com back in January and was shocked when my account got overcharged by £16.

I soon called booking.com and it wasn't their fault as they had to call the Hilton.  They did and I got an email through saying that I would receive a refund within 7-10 business days.  This was the 22nd January.  I've attached the email below.

This never happened.  It is now 2nd Feb.  I call booking.com again to see what has happened.  Once again,  they call up the Hilton to see what has gone on.  I then receive an email on the 9th stating the payment has gone through.

Over 3 weeks after initially being overcharged I'm back to where I would have been if I'd booked with any other company.  Except I've lost a lot of time and been stressed sorting The Hilton's problems out.

I complained to The Hilton explaining how they had wasted my time and asking for compensation. 

Initially, I started my complaint through the main website and after a few back and forth emails they get you to the right department. 

On the 17th Feb I receive and email saying my complaint has been forwarded to someone at the Hilton Bankside, expect a reply within 3 business days.  I've heard this old chestnut before...

To my surprise I had a voicemail on the 20th February saying to call back or email.  On the 21st I sent an email to the stated address from the voicemail.  6 days pass.

I call up the Hilton on the 27th and ask for Hannah Mitford (""Guest Services Executive"").  She was not there.  So, I let Anna, who I spoke to on the phone, let Hannah know to check her email.  Sounds almost surreal...

Hannah then emails me the next day, 1 week after my initial email to her...

She went on to explain the overcharging happened due to a ""slight system error"" and said I was refunded ""immediately"".  Lies.  

So I sent her an email back on the same day (28/02/17) explaining how I was unhappy with the situation and my time being wasted.  She didn't reply.  I also sent a reminder to answer my email on the 9th March but still to no avail.
To this day (18/03/17) I have not had a response. 

I think this level of service is just rude and unacceptable.  Especially for a 4 star hotel.  The hotel itself was nice, but when you're paying as much as you do for a room that's what you'd expect.  This whole ordeal tainted my visit and my view of the Hilton Hotels.

I will not be recommending anyone to stay here.

120,"Some good, some bad - not great value.","Booked 'Executive King Room with Lounge Access'... checked in, requested room on upper floor, they put us in a corner room at the back which was a SHOEBOX with a view over a railway line and a broken down derelict building. For an 'Executive King Room' this was an absolute joke. Requested to change, were told that they didn't know when we could be changed as it was busy, when my partner asked for a rough estimate, the manager at front desk (J) was pretty snotty with their reply. Afterwards though, we dealt with Anise who was absolutely lovely which was nice. Finally given different room which was on the side facing the shard building which was a little bigger. We paid for three nights with breakfast. The first two mornings we were given breakfast in the large dining area with an amazing spread for breakfast - this was probably the best breakfast I have had at a hotel. However on the third morning, we were ushered into the executive lounge and told that because we were departing that morning, we would be given breakfast in the executive lounge - which has a VERY small fraction of what the dining room breakfast has. If we paid for three nights with breakfast, why were we being short-changed on the third morning just because we were departing that day? What difference does it make?? This left us feeling like we were being nickle and dimed. Having spend almost $900 for three nights, this wasn't the best impression to leave us with. Won't be back.",3,2017,03,16
120,Back at the bankside Hilton to attend C2C2017,"Stayed here last year and had a pretty good stay with a few niggles! This time it was PERFECT from checking in to checkout it was such a pleasure to stay here. The room at least to me seemed to have additional lighting to when I stayed last time (one of my issues as I'm partial sighted) also the lobby brightness also seemed to have been raised too and this was welcome too as it was easier to navigate! 

This occasion I had executive lounge access and had breakfast there one morning of my 3 day stay and it was lovely and cosy and
Not to busy.. coffee from the bean to cup machine was excellent I have to say!

Breakfast in the main restaurant was also 5 star (best breakfast at a London Hilton I've had) 

The dinner in the evening was lovely had a two course meal (squid as starter) and belly pork as Main and it's was super delicious.. 

I'd like the thank sawah and Mohamed for their service towards me that evening! 👌🏻

The room was gorgeous and as I said last time I reviewed the hotel the BEST bed at any hotel I've ever stayed in!

I had a deluxe king room and it was spotlessly clean and so well presented it still feels brand new over a year after opening as a hotel! 

My room was turned down for my return to the hotel each night of the stay (this was great) I'm in the industry and wish more of us hotels did this service which is old school theses days but it's something that matters and shows they hotel has given the guest thought and consideration!👍🏻

Going to book again for C2C2018 next year and can't wait to return to this great ""hidden away"" hilton in the heart of London..

120,Top London hotel in a location you need to look at.,"We booked this hotel on a friends recommendation. First off it looks great, what's called a design hotel.....I think. The outside is cant be missed with a massive Bankside out on the street. The welcome when we arrived was warm and the staff attentive. We had our key and were off to the room in about 5 minutes. The room was a decent size for a deluxe and nicely designed with some good features. In particular the HUGE walk in shower. The only downside (for a deluxe room) was the view, in detail it was the biggest wall I've ever seen. From what I could see most of the rooms on that side of the hotel look on onto this wall. If a view is important you'll have to make sure you're not in one of these. For me it wasn't a big deal as the room was so nice anyway. 
We drank in the bar. Good selection of drinks with good cocktails and friendly staff. A nice place to sit as well. Only downside, it is expensive (6 pounds for a beer and about 12 pounds for a cocktail), also later at night we found the service very slow. Seems to be one actual bartender to every 3 staff. 
Room service was good especially the person looking after it, very quick and friendly. We didn't eat in the restaurant at night but we had our breakfast there. It a cool place and the food at breakfast was very good with lots of choice.
Bankside is also a great location. Not one that comes up at the top of the list of areas to stay in London but you have to look at it. The hotel is in a relatively quiet spot with a couple of bars close by and the union street café (Gordon Ramsey) but a short walk away is the river side and all the bars, buskers and walkways. Its also right beside the Tate Modern if that's your thing. 
All in all a great hotel in a great location.",4,2017,03,15
120,Great location - thats about it,"so the formula is simple - by a disused building on the cheap in a good location, build out the hotel with cost as a priority, but have a few extra flavours of trend and charge £300 a night. Yes location is excellent, but the hotel is like a it came of a production line and putting in a wall of old copper coins in the bar, or some mock graffiti art outside doesn't make it cool. 

The service was poor. My wife arrived earlier than me and despite her having a shared credit card with me, a copy of the booking confirmation and it being her birthday she had to haggle to be allowed in the room. Not a good policy at the hotel to have. Indeed the common sense theme echo'd in the bar, where someone has decided to blast out Top 20 hits from 5 years ago.. ruins the ambience completely.

The rooms are uninspiring, the bed sheets uncomfortable, the view from the rooms non existent. The only upside is the cleaning was very good and they are a fair size.

I wouldn't return, I think the London Bridge Hotel or Mondrian are better choices at similar prices in the same area. On that note they have struck gold in their location decision, good choice.",3,2017,03,15
120,Great hotel/great location/great staff,"Stayed at the Hilton Bankside on a short trip to London. From the moment you get through the revolving door you are welcome by a lovely scent, a great open space and very helpful staff. The room I stayed in was very spacious with a VERY comfy bed, large bathroom with very good quality toiletries and very clean throughout. I felt a bit cold in the room as the aircon was on, though, this is a problem I always have wherever I go. I am just not capable of controlling the room temperature :-). I would definitely recommend this hotel to anyone.",5,2017,03,14
120,Lovely staff ,"Stayed here for 2 nights, staff were more than happy to help you with anything, happy and smiley :) can't do enough. Hotel has a pool, spa and gym. Bar has a happy hour 4-6 buy one cocktail get one for 1p! Loved staying here would return :) ",5,2017,03,12
120,Excellent,"Fantastic location, so close to all the South Bank has to offer beautiful modern feel and decor, staff really friendly, superb value for money...Much higher standards and quality than many West End hotels in the same price range...Well worth considering",5,2017,03,12
120,Excellent Hotel/Excellent Price,Stayed here for one night in Jan 2017 to see Phantom of the Opera. Staff and concierge could not be more helpful. Room amenities excellent. The hotel is situated close to all local transport. Very quiet room and had the best sleep in ages thanks to the large king size bed.,5,2017,03,12
120,Unknown gem,"Stayed for 1 night whilst in London for various events, chose this hotel as it was on south bank not far from Borough Market which was one of our destinations. It was only a week prior to Christmas and the hotel was decorated with 2 lovely trees in the lobby - unusual ones too. 
I was at the time using a walking stick and the receoptionist spotted this and asked the 2 young people ahead would they mind if she helped me first to save me standing in the queue too long - very helpful. 
We were soon in our room which had large single beds a large TV one armchair and tea/coffee available. 
We did not eat in the hotel as we were meeting friends but the restaurant area did look good as did the menu.
There are plenty of bus links and tube stations close by so easy to get in to centre of London. Being a little outside central area meant a cheaper rate too.",5,2017,03,12
120,A little gem on the south bank,"A second visit every bit as good as the first we arrived before our allotted check in time hoping to be bale to watch the rugby before heading down to the O2.  Although I used the in app checkin we were moved to another room that was ready to go, so we would catch the game.

A very comfortable room, we love the bathroom and the industrial look, the shower is super, we are very picky about showers as these are often an after thought.

A super location as the river taxis are just out front of the Tate modern and we drifted down the river to the Rod Stewart concert.  a perfect location this one is easily missed but is s much better than some of the other sites closer to the O2 venue.

A great selection of all things breakfast, we will be back sometime this summer",5,2017,03,12
120,Fabulous!,"Every detail is neat and researched. A good product, a very good one, reasonably priced. The staff is very friendly and the features are really enjoyable, especially the leisure area. The area is also perfect to explore the city. Lovely time once again at Hilton!",5,2017,03,11
120,Perfect hotel for your London visit,"Modern hotel with tasteful design. Very well trained and mannered staff - they will try everything to please their customers and make them happy.  If you decide for the hotel definitely decide for the rooms or suits with lounge access. You will definitely enjoy the interior design of  it but also the food and drinks that are served by very professional wait staff that is usually hard to find in London. The Hilton Bankside sets very high measurements in hospitality. 
I stayed at a Junior Suit for 2 nights and it is definitely worth the money. The king size bed had a nice firm mattress and expensive linen to provide a relaxing sleep. Black out curtains blocked the light so I was able to sleep at night. The door and walls were noise prove. The bathroom was nice and big. The only downsides are the TV that you can not move into another angle, so you can watch it only from the bed but not while sitting in the armchair or on the sofa. And the sofa actually moved apart also - no comfortable sitting on it. But I will definitely come back to this hotel.",5,2017,03,11
120,Great stay!,We were attending an alumni day locally and this location seemed ideal.It had good reviews online but I cannot say enough  things about the quality of the hotel and service especially the concierge John who took it upon himself to look after our lost luggage[by the airline].His caring and professionalism will never be forgotten.The food and service in the executive lounge was excellent.,5,2017,03,10
120,Best Hilton in England,"I stay in many Hilton hotels throughout the country during my travels and must say this is the best one I have stayed in and could not fault anything. It is located near the Thames and close to many of the popular attractions south of the river, and also a short hop to the West End. 
It was so pleasant to have such great service from All the staff were who were attentive to our needs. This was only a short stay but will be back soon. Yes it is a new hotel but well designed and gives the impression of plenty of room which made relaxing easy.",5,2017,03,09
120,A hotel that sings quality,"This is a quality hotel - great efficient friendly welcoming staff. Super attention to detail. Spacious double bedroom. Quiet. Clean. Great shower.

Feels like luxury. I ordered lamb curry from room service (about £25) and a bottle of Gavi di Gavi (£30). They bring it in on a table like days of yore. And the breakfasts are great. Love the open arrangement with the kitchen. (I had a great mushroom omelette). Movies on TV (about £13 each).

Only downside is the internet connection. The standard service is poor. The premium service I think is around £10 a night. It's worth it but a hotel of this standard should just provide this service for nothing. It's an expectation nowadays.

Very handy for Shakespeare's Globe and all the other Southbank attractions. And a special shout out for the concierge who was like a kind of super hero with special senses that tuned into what you wanted when you wanted it.",4,2017,03,09
120,Wonderful and relaxing hotel,"Beautiful hotel in the South bank area. The athmosphere at the hotel var very relaxing and the staff was very friendly and polite. I was surprised With how quiet the hotel was, I didn't hear any trafikk or noise from the street. The South bank area is very clean and contains  quite a few nice restaurants and cafes. The hotel is very close to the riverside (South of the Themes) which  has a promenade which is very nice for a stroll. There is also a great Food market nearby.",5,2017,03,08
120,What a great find in central London!,"The best bit is the staff, universally friendly, polite and helpful. All of them. Everywhere. Rooms are big, bright, relaxing and comfortable. Good bathroom amenities. Food delicious. Public rooms delightful. Really great location. What's not to like? Oh, and good value too.",5,2017,03,08
120,New Hilton,"A new Hilton on the south bank, adjacent to the Tate Modern, a well designed hotel super facilities.  Enjoyed our weekend trip perfectly placed to take a river taxi down to the O2.  It was very enjoyable floating along the Thames early evening.

Hotel is efficient, clean, tidy, another great Hilton experience ",4,2017,03,07
120,Excellent Hotel,"Overall excellent hotel. For a London hotel, it is very spacious. The staff at the reception are nice though they could smile a little. The restaurant is nice and breakfast has a good spread. Rooms are nice - though the views out of the window are into the neighbors apartment. The downside is that it is not in the central business district of London. But it is close to the southwark tube station and very convenient. The conference facilities were nice as well. Overall I liked the place.",4,2017,03,06
120,Wow!,"What a find. We thought we would try this hotel instead of our usual Hilton Tower Bridge and we couldn't be more pleased. 
Never stayed in a chain hotel with such friendly and helpful staff. 
Great food, great drink and great service. 
We have already changed future bookings to this hotel. 
Looking forward to our next visit. ",5,2017,03,06
120,Just perfect!!,"We stayed in the hotel for just two nights.. we could not fault anything about this hotel! 
It's modern spotlessly clean, with great attention to detail in everyway. 

As well as all the essential items you get in a normal hotel, they also provide you with lovely big dressing gowns, slippers, free WiFi and we even had an umbrella which was a nice touch! 

The swimming pool and gym were both well equipped. However i did find the jacuzzi quite cold as it's attached to the pool. But I not sure that would bother most people! 

The Staff are all so friendly and eager to please they are great ambassadors for the  Hilton brand! 

The breakfast's what can I say.. just AMAZING.. the variety of the food and the quality and the fact it was beautifully presented was just perfect! 

We also had Dinner one night, which was equally as good.

For business or pleasure this is the Hotel for you! 

We can not wait to come back to London and stay at the bankside again.

",5,2017,03,06
120,Very pleasantly surprised,This Hilton is excellent. My wife travels for a living and has stayed at Hiltons worldwide. She was particularly impressed with the bed and the sumptuous breakfast choices. We couldn't fault the staff either. All were extremely friendly and polite. Great hotel! ,5,2017,03,06
120,Highly recommended ,"Big, white fluffy towels, exceptional service and beds you could get lost in ...I LOVE this hotel. And I love the hidden little white origami foxes. If you're a fan of a Negroni, you must try a British Bouquet in the Distillery bar. (Go for Happy Hour between 4-6pm and you get GREAT value for money.) Don't miss the pool - we were lucky enough to have it all to ourselves on a Sunday evening. Pure indulgence! And if you can bear to leave, the location in London is excellent. ",5,2017,03,06
120,Another wonderful stay!,"I was eager to return to the Hilton London Bankside after a lovely stay over the Christmas holidays the year before; as soon as my family decided to spend New Year's in London to see the fireworks I booked rooms for the hotel.  Understandably the hotel was at high occupancy and as Hilton Diamond members we were upgraded from standard to deluxe rooms.  The rooms were modern, spacious, and nicely decorated.  The executive lounge was as terrific as I remembered - although the offerings were somewhat limited the staff in the lounge were very nice and friendly.  What most impressed me was the breakfast the hotel was kind enough to pack our final morning.  We had a 7 am train to catch and I had requested breakfast to go expecting some small boxed meals.  On check out we were handed a large shopping bag full of goodies; they had packed for each of us an individual bag of several small pastries, yogurt, apple, pear (the most amazing pear btw!), bottled juice, fresh juice, and water.  I normally forget to request breakfast to go when I check out early from a hotel but we had no time to grab breakfast before our early morning train ride and a packed schedule for the rest of the day so I wanted to make sure we had something to eat during our 2+ hr journey.  And what a meal it was!  The Hilton London Bankside made an already terrific stay even better and sets the bar high for all other hotels.  I highly recommend this outstanding hotel and will definitely be back my next trip to London.",5,2017,03,05
120,"Fabulous location, very cool hotel with lovely staff","We're Londoners who work locally to the Hilton and use the bar and restaurant regularly.  Chose it for an overnight stay for my husband's special birthday and it didn't disappoint.  We had a third floor executive king - spacious room, huge comfortable bed, lovely bathroom and complimentary soft drinks and snacks from the minibar. But best of all is the lounge access that comes with the room - a lovely space to meet, chill, have a few drinks and snacks - all complimentary.  They even have a free breakfast - not quite the choice of the main restaurant, but really very good. A perfect choice for a stay in London - I'd recommend it to Londoners, tourists and Business trippers alike. Staff all very courteous and charming.  Only niggle is they didn't pick up on my 'special birthday' hints - so maybe just be a bit more pushy than we were!  Never mind, try again in 10 years!  Perfect location btw - we know this area well.  5mins walk to the tube, half an hour to Islington, 20 mins riverside walk to Covent Garden and Borough Market just up the road.  The Tate is just behind the hotel and South Bank 5 mins away. Just loved strolling around this amazing city that we live in but don't stop to appreciate and admire very often.",5,2017,03,05
120,Totally amazing hotel - highly recommend this Hilton ,"All the reviews don't show how amazing this hotel is and the level of detail that the staff go to making your stay personal and perfect - highly recommend this location with the river, mainlibe rail and underground on the door step.",5,2017,03,05
120,Hilton Diamond and Business Travellers Beware,"My girlfriend surprised me with a overnight getaway and booked our room through a GDS travel site.  On the reservation she added my name and Hilton HHonors number.  I have been a Dimond member for years and travel around the globe monthly.  At check-in the floor manager refused to honour my HHonors status.  I politely explained to her that she was the first Hilton employee to not recognise the HHonors status and that we had recently, within the last 45 days, stayed at a London Hilton and had no issues.  Her answer was Hilton Corporate changed the policy for third party bookings about a year and a half ago and as a Hilton Hotel they enforce the corporate policy.  I pulled the Hilton Terms and showed it to her, which does discuss third party bookings, but clearly states GDS booking do allow for HHonors recognition, but she still refused.  She stated she would allow for me to check in an hour early and upgrade my room.  The upgrade turned out to be two single separate beds, although she knew my girlfriend was with me.  I then asked to speak to the Executive Hotel Manager.  He arrived after speaking with his floor manager and stated he would be drawing a line in the sand and would not honour my HHonors status and that I was free to call HHonors relations to verify their position, but at this time he had made his decision and would not be changing it.  Later I called the relations department and they verified that the Manager could make this decision locally, but stated it is very rare and most Hilton locations value their HHonors members.  Corporate went on to say that many business travellers have to book hotels third party as part of their business accounts and it would be rare for a individual hotel to take this stance.  I followed up with the Executive Manager with the information Corporate relations had given and he stated this is his hotel policy and if it causes future customer service problems or loss of business it was a risk he was willing to take.  So HHonor members and business travellers beware Hilton Bankside will not honour your HHonor status.",2,2017,03,05
120,Lovely until....,"Beautiful interior, friendly staff, lovely pool, BUT....
Room service quality very poor: cold food, quality of products poor, forgotten condiments e.g. Toast no jam. Required multiple phone calls to room service to sort and still overall substandard. When discussed on check out for a discount to be added to this part of the bill I was made to feel as if in court under prosecution and all efforts to disprove my feedback were made. This was very upsetting and left feeling awful.
Bad enough for my partner and I to definitely not be going back.",2,2017,03,05
120,Everything a good hotel should be! ,"Superb place, not sure if it's 4 or 5 star it also has a pool, it's relatively new with typical contemporary style. Probably less than a year old but it's been maintained very well. Excellent courteous staff, everything you should expect from a Hilton. Stayed on the executive floor booked though hotels.com - Don't expect a view from the room but do expect a great night sleep, excellent amenities and exceptional service. Would recommend to anyone to stay here especially if you want to be south of the river. Probably one of the newest Hilton's in London. ",5,2017,03,04
120,Great Hotel,"Super hotel, wish my company had it on their list but for some reason Capita don't have it on there. So nice to stay in a modern comfortable place with very nice staff. Only downside is the tube isn't close by so travel is a bit of a challenge 
Hopefully will return soon.",5,2017,03,03
120,A short stay in London,Our experience at this hotel was excellent.  In particular the staff were outstanding.  The moment we arrived at the hotel we had a warm welcome and made to feel like a valued customer.  This continued throughout our stay and I cannot thank them all enough for a fantastic trip.,5,2017,03,03
120,Hilton bankside,Could not fault this hotel in any way. Modern and stylish. From the moment we arrived until the moment we left. We are already planning another weekend in London and will definitely stay at this hotel again.,5,2017,03,02
120,Wonderful stay at the Hilton,"We stayed here for two nights in total for a weekend trip. All of the staff we encountered were exceptionally friendly and helpful - customer service at it's finest! The room we stayed in was on the 4th floor, very clean and the shower was amazing. The bed was spacious and extremely comfortable, we had a large television directly infront of the bed which made it cosy on a nighttime. We had a complimentary minibar which was a nice addition to our stay and the bottled water was also complimentary. Our room was also equipped with a kettle, coffee and tea which made mornings perfect as I love coffee when I wake up.
The location is perfect as it is within walking distance of the popular tourist attractions such as the London Eye and Big Ben and is also within walking distance of Leicester Square. Southwark underground is also a 5 minute walk away if you were wanting to travel further out. 

I'd also like to thank whoever left slippers and water by the sides of our bed by the time we came back after an evening out, it was a surprising gesture.

I would definitely stay here again as I could not fault anything during our stay. I did not get to visit the bar which was open until midnight but it seems to have good reviews.",5,2017,03,01
120,Penthouse !,"The hotel itself is very modern and not really our style.  The staff were excellent and for the location in London this hotel offered fantastic value. I would recommend it for anyone looking to do London with a bit of luxury on a budget.  After our first night we upgraded to the penthouse which was actually pure luxury and it did not cost that much either! it is the perfect space for entertaining in London, you could easily host pre dinner drinks or have small gathering there, the terrace is huge which in the summer would be amazing! x  Trust me if you can upgrade!",4,2017,03,01
120,Quality hotel just behind Tate Modern,"You don't stay here for a view of London but extremely comfortable and well designed rooms, great amenities with very friendly and helpful staff. Excellent breakfast in the restaurant. I haven't tried lunch or dinner. I wouldn't use room service though. Well located with lots of good and varied local restaurants.  I like this place.",5,2017,02,28
120,Outstanding Stay!,"This Hilton is a Wonderful! The property and rooms are modern and fresh. The neighborhood is quiet and offers quick access to Central London in minutes by car/Underground. The Executive Lounge, restaurant/bar, gym and pool also make for a great hotel! You will not be disappointed.",5,2017,02,27
120,Wonderful Stay,We chose the Hilton Bankside for its location and were not disappointed.  It was my husband's birthday and even though we live in London it was a real treat to stay and town.  We enjoyed our stay and would definitely recommend the hotel.,5,2017,02,27
120,One of the top Hilton options in London,Excellent service. Beautiful rooms. Very high level build quality for London. Location close to the City and public transport options. Staff particularly at front desk and breakfast very friendly. One of the best breakfast options I have seen for many years in the City. Has a boutique feel to it and high quality bordering on luxury. Really a great choice.,5,2017,02,27
120,One night stay. Great but not quite perfect,"Excellent, and I really do mean excellent reception staff. Room was impressive as was bathroom. Only practical drawback was that it was quite dark and getting ready with hair and make up was a challenge with light levels. Breakfast was great but only niggle was that we were not served a hot drink",4,2017,02,27
120,Very good but not perfect,"We travelled with 2 young children during the Feb half term. The hotel common areas were spotless and smelt beautiful. Check in was easy. Unfortunately our rooms were not ready even though we arrived at 3pm, the check in time stated. We booked connecting rooms and we allocated two rooms connected by a common hallway. The children's room was nice but ours was a bit small dark. Strangely there were no ceiling lights at all in both rooms and the windows looked out to small roof areas. I particularly liked the kids dressing gowns and slippers provided. Very cute and extremely useful for their swims in the pool. Which btw did not have a hot tub but a connected sitting area with bubble jets. The swimming pool did have very clean facilities and a 2 lovely rain showers. Breakfast was great, fantastic choices. Ask the chefs for anything you'd like that is not already out on display. We had waffles and pancakes. Dinner was very fancy but not particularly nice. The kids menu wasn't well thought out and would suit much older children.
Overall however, the stay was pleasant. Most disappointing though was housekeeping, which failed to be completed on time each day. A bit of a let down especially as all the other staff are wonderful, especially the staff at the breakfast time.",4,2017,02,26
120,Lovely,Lovely hotel in a great position for sightseeing. Great staff who are very helpful in all your needs. Standard rooms are not overlarge but very comfortable with lovely big beds. Breakfast is very good. Reasonably priced for what you get.,4,2017,02,26
120,South Bank style!,"What a great hotel!

Right in the heart of the vibrant South Bank this hotel is within 500m of The Tate Modern, The Globe and The Millennium Bridge.

We stayed here for a weekend break and the whole experience was just so enjoyable.

If you enjoy the hustle and bustle of city life then this hotel is a must.",5,2017,02,26
120,A perfect stay at the Hilton Bankside,"The hotel is very well located.  We had a perfect experience staying there.  Everything was to our satisfaction.  The room was very comfortable and super quiet !  The staff, welcoming, helpful and courteous.",5,2017,02,25
120,Wonderful Hotel,"We stay at Hilton Bankside regularly and just completed our best stay yet. Everything was perfect and we could not fault one thing. Staff are friendly and helpful. We arrived at midday and our room was ready. Room was quiet and well furnished. Breakfast is high quality with large choice of cereals and a superb granola, back bacon and quality sausages, freshly squeezed juices and tasty pastries. Executive lounge is well run with nice spread at afternoon tea and good choice of nibbles in the evening all with great service. We was extended a late check out and had a really nice stay. We are returning to Hilton Bankside again in a few weeks and cannot wait.",5,2017,02,25
120,Lovely Stay ,"Stayed here using Tesco vouchers 
Staff amazingly helpful and polite especially concierge and valet.
Valet good value at £40 all in
Breakfast was lovely 
Very central to everything 
We will definitely be back! ",5,2017,02,25
120,Overnight stay on a work event,"Stopped here overnight for a works event, the room was fab and had everything we needed.

All the staff where really helpful during our stay, Also the location was just a short walk from the main bus route, so after arriving by train, it we hopped on to the bus and a short walk, and we was there, and we popped on a bus to take us to covent garden.

We really enjoyed our stay and hope to return soon if we can.",5,2017,02,24
120,Almost a five!,"Lovely hotel on a quiet street with quick, excellent access.  The room was much larger and roomier than most London hotel rooms and very clean.  Loved the large bathroom with the roomy shower and strong water pressure, had an excellent few night's sleep snuggled in the duvets and used the desk for business.  
The staff was absolutely excellent, welcoming, helpful and professional.  The only thing that was a bit crazy, and it happened twice, was challenges with the housekeeping team.  The first was a 9:45 pm/2145 turndown service....already sound asleep when received loud knocking on the door and a key inserted and banging against the security feature.  I have never had turndown service offered so late in my life and frankly, not only did it startle me but it also made it difficult to get back to sleep.  The second was that my room was not serviced and I had to call down at the end of the day to have someone come, which made me late for dinner.  Beside that slight hiccup, it was an excellent stay.",4,2017,02,23
120,Nice new hotel south of river,"A good Hilton hotel, it's new so feels fresh and has a great swimming pool. Rooms very nice and comfortable. Breakfast was pleasant with plenty of choice. 

Access to exec lounge is restricted to diamond members. ",5,2017,02,23
120,Oasis on Bankside,"Calm comfort in London, well placed to enjoy the amenities of the South Bank plus easy access to Westminster tourist sites. The hotel restaurant is well worth a booking, good selection of high quality courses. ",4,2017,02,22
120,5 star experience in 5 star hotel,"From check in to check out I have but one thing to say... WAW! 
Evi at check in was absolutely amazing! friendly, professional and international! We quickly realised we were both greek and continued the conversation in our own language! Evi welcomed me with a big smile, and made me feel comfortable right away. Making me valued by mentioning to me she personally took care of my complimentary HH upgrade was the cherry on the top!

The Executive Lounge is a unique experience. George seemed quite busy but found time to interact.the complimentary drinks were flowing and constantly topped up.

The room was amazing! vast, well lit with a great design... not to mention the bed! Most comfortable night I have had in ages!

Breakfast experience was unique! a vast selection of items in a huge breakfast room!

Hilton Bankside, I will be back!
Thank you for a fantastic experience!

Anthony

ps: quick thumbs up to the french concierge, knowledgeable, friendly and professional! Unfortunately I didn't catch his name.",5,2017,02,22
120,Brilliant hotel,"I travel to London very frequently for work and discovered the Bankside hotel this year, I find myself returning as often as I can. The hotel is superb, the location is great, very close to Southwark Tube station and a 15 minute walk to London Bridge station. The lobby is beautifully decorated, as is the rest of the hotel. I've stayed in several different room types all of which had very comfortable beds, clean spacious bathrooms, robes/slippers and everything else you would expect from a hotel of this standard. The room service is also good. I have had breakfast in both the restaurant and the executive lounge and both have excellent selections, the restaurant does have a wider selection of hot food which is really the only comparison. I have also used the bar several times which has an extensive range of spirts and wine. Service has always been 100% and I have not encountered any problems. I use the pool, which is at a good temperature, is never busy and is a decent size for doing laps, the gym is also a good shout and has good availability. Wifi is consistent, which is great for work and streaming etc. All in all I will continue to return and sing the Hilton Banksides praises.",5,2017,02,22
120,Amazing Hotel!!!,"This hotel was absolutely AMAZING! It definitely did not feel like your typical Hilton at all. The design was sleek, cool and modern. The staff were super friendly and went out of their way to make sure our stay was perfect. The King Executive Room was heavenly, and we absolutely loved the Bose speakers in the ultra modern bathroom. The Executive Lounge was superb. From breakfast, to afternoon tea, to evening drinks reception and canapés, everything was perfect! I will highly suggest this hotel to any of my friends and colleagues who are looking for an awesome hotel in London in a very cool and convenient location. This will definitely be our go to spot from now on for our yearly London trip. 

I would also like to acknowledge two members of staff who went above and beyond. First, Anais, who coordinated a birthday surprise for my boyfriend via emails over a month before our stay. It was truly amazing. Balloons, confetti and a beautiful chocolate cake were in our room when we arrived back to the hotel from our first night out in London. My boyfriend was completely blown away. The birthday surprise was a complete success. Second, Chubby from the hotel bar, who rectified a slightly inconvenient situation in the bar. We really appreciated his wonderful customer service and quick thinking. 

Thank you Hilton London Bankside for delivering a truly amazing experience.",5,2017,02,21
120,Favourite Hotel,We love the location close to all the attractions of the South Bank. The friendly staff are always welcoming and helpful. It is well worth treating yourself to the comfortable executive lounge with its cosy fires and easy chairs after a day's sightseeing.,5,2017,02,21
120,Stay at the hilton,"Service and quality very good however the size of the room was far smaller than that advertised.  Food in restaurant is nothing special.
No doubt that it is a very nice hotel in a central position with easy access to the main sites.",4,2017,02,20
120,Weekend in London,"This hotel came on recomendation from our son who stays here often. we were not disappointed.

From the minute we arrived the service was excellent. Even though we arrived hours before our check in time we were able to leave our bags and head off into town. we were told we woud be contacted as soon as our room was ready and it was only as we were walking to the Shard that we had a call to say it was ready.

The fascilities are excellent and we were able to make use of the swimming pool before going our for dinner.

We did not have dinner in the hotel but the breakfast next morning was excellent. The best buffet style breakfast we have experienced in the UK.

The Distillery Bar was pleasant and the service great. Prices in the bar were much as expected for a London Hotel.

We will certainly stay here again wihtout doubt.

The quality of the staff and service was excellent in all areas.",5,2017,02,20
120,A great find! Lovely hotel in good location,"Stayed here on business, in the King Guest Room. Arrived in the evening to a stylish looking hotel 5 mins walk from Southwark station. Easy, quick check in and polite, friendly staff - small lobby but very nice bar and restaurant.

The room was absolutely spotless, felt brand new and stylish - and even though our view was of literally just a wall, the room was still bright and somehow this didn't bother us. Good wifi and plenty of space for luggage, desk area for working etc. Great bathroom! Housekeeping was reliable although slightly inconsistent (tea/coffee wasn't fully replenished, no complimentary water until the last night) but nothing major. It wasn't worth mentioning but if we had, I'm sure they would have sorted it out quickly. 

Air conditioning was a little weird, the temperature kept re-setting itself to lower than we wanted so it was a little cool in the room, but again nothing major.

There was a fire alarm while we were there and it turned out to be nothing, but one of the staff we encountered on the way down seemed a little uncertain about what we should be doing (as the alarm suddenly stopped). Looking back, I think they should have directed us downstairs without any hesitation, regardless of whether it was 'real' or not! I'm sure this was a one-off as generally speaking the staff were extremely capable and helpful.

All in all, this was a lovely hotel to stay in. In London where hotels are extremely overpriced and often a little tired/old, this hotel stands out with its excellent facilities, great location and overall high standard. Will look forward to staying here again!",5,2017,02,18
120,Flipping FANTASTIC!!,"Sorry this review is so long but I want to make sure I do this hotel justice! 
Every single thing about this hotel is fantastic! As Hilton Honors members we were sent an email the day before our arrival offering us the chance to select our own room. When I looked at the available rooms I couldn't decide, so called the hotel to ask which would best suit our desires. I spoke to Ana who was so helpful and friendly. When we arrived the following day we happened to go to Ana's check in desk and when we said our name she actually remembered our conversation! She even offered an alternative to the room we had selected which was identical except one floor higher so with a better view, and was already available so we were able to go to the room 2 and a half hours before official check in time! (We stayed in room 755)
We had booked an executive room which gives you access to the executive lounge and is well worth the little extra. It offers breakfast in the morning (cold meats and cheeses, fruit, breads as well sausage, bacon and eggs) afternoon tea (sandwiches and cakes) evening canapés and drinks, as well as all day soft drinks and tea/coffee. 
The entire hotel is immaculate and the room was no exception. I loved the little reading lights that just pop out of the wall! And the shower... well I have to say it was the nicest shower I have ever had and I have been lucky enough to stay in a few other pretty nice hotels!! 
Some rooms have a bath with shower over and some have a walk in shower, so if you have a preference you should ask. Apparently rooms that end with '19' so 119, 219 etc have a bath AND separate shower. 
I had mentioned to Ana on the phone that it was a special weekend for us so it was a really lovely surprise to have a delicious cake with 'congratulations' written on the plate in chocolate delivered to our room. 
The hotel has a swimming pool which unfortunately we didn't have time to use, but we will definitely be returning so maybe next time! 
Also just for your information (incase you were wondering) an executive room includes complimentary snacks and non alcoholic drinks from the mini bar. 
When we were trying to decide which hotel to stay at I looked at maps and wasn't completely sure about the location but it turned out to be brilliant. The distances weren't nearly as far as it looked on the map. It literally takes 2 minutes to walk from the hotel to The Tate or about 3 minutes to The Millennium bridge. If you cross the Millennium bridge you're at St Paul's cathedral within 5 minutes of leaving the hotel. Blackfriars train station is only a 3 minute walk away (as it has exits at both ends of the platforms, so you can exit to the South Bank side)

In summary I cannot fault this hotel and to be honest I am pretty fussy and quite difficult to please sometimes! You should definitely stay here! 
I hope my review as helped you.

120,Good,Brand new hotel. Super location .Really nice rooms and a particularly nice executive lounge. Had breakfast in the lounge and there was a good selection. Pleasant staff there offering eggs to order . Staff throughout hotel are very pleasant. Nice bar area . Only complaint was that the bar only offered craft beers which I don't like . I feel I should be able to get well known brands at a Hilton . ,4,2017,02,17
120,Great experience,Great staff. Very beautiful and clean room. Amazing breakfast. It eas such a great nice for a young couple to stay. Definitely recommend this place to everyone. Will be back!!!!!!!!!!!! Thank you hilton :),5,2017,02,16
120,Excellent Business Stay,"I have stayed here approx 4/5 times now for business.
Staff are always excellent and make our stay very enjoyable.
Conference rooms, bar and breakfast were all great.
Not a bad word to say about this hotel.",5,2017,02,15
120,Terrific Hotel and Location,"This is one of the nicest hotels I have stayed in across all major brands.  It is relatively new so everything is clean, crisp, and fresh.  The staff are all very friendly and helpful.  The rooms are large, well decorated,and the bathroom/shower is also very large. It is decorated with a modern flair, both in the room and throughout the hotel.  There is an excellent restaurant and separate bar on the lower level which not only caters to the hotel guests but also other locals/visitors.  The hotel is perfectly located nearby many good restaurants, office buildings, and local attractions. The rooms are very quiet; you can't hear anything from the other rooms, and there is very solid glass on the windows which prevents any noise from the outside from getting in.",5,2017,02,14
120,Superb,Amazing location and for the quality of the hotel allied to the price you pay this is a real hidden gem. Room was completely silent and looked like it was decorated yesterday - it was that clean. Will definitely stay here again.,5,2017,02,14
120,Good hotel close to centre,"Good hotel (few minutes walk to southbank underground) the outside of the hotel looks old but the inisde is perfect. Nice staff, good bar, spacious rooms and close to serval pubs and restaurants. Try union street bistro! ",5,2017,02,14
120,"Better option, area wise. They take customer service seriously.","This hotel is much easier access to everything and all places than if you are on the other side of Millennium Bridge. Nothing to see there but roadworks and traffic. The hotel is pretty new. One of the best Hiltons I have stayed at.  Staff were very courteous and welcoming.  The bathroom was spacious and the amenities are complete, has an umbrella in the room for guest's use. Breakfast spread was ok but after about 5 days of eating the same breakfast, it could also get a little tiring :-(
Overall, I had a pleasant experience with this hotel.  I will definitely stay at this hotel for my future trips to London whether for business or for leisure.",4,2017,02,14
120,Great location,"This exceptionally stylish hotel is ideally located and is a mere 6 minute walk from the nearest tube station. A stones throw from the Shard. 
We had a standard room which was beautifully decorated and extremely well equipped.
I would highly recommend.",5,2017,02,13
120,Great hotel,"Was a last minute booking, due to change of plans. We had a lovely spacious room with ensuite. Shower was one of those waterfall showers! 
The breakfast was undeniably good. Best pastries. Lots of choice, and covered a range of hot, cold and different dietary requirements.
The food in the bar was very good, though large portions.
The location is ok, more towards the city end of things, but still feasible to go everywhere.
All in all a great stay.",5,2017,02,13
120,Anniversary ,"I have to say that this was a beautiful hotel and an amazing stay and backside Hilton! From the minute we got through the door we were welcomed and looked after!!! The room we stayed in was amazing and comfortable! Myself and partner work long hours and wanted a quiet stay and we got exactly that! The breakfast in the morning was tasty and had a full range from hot food to continental! We were close to the underground which was also a Benefit as we had a show in the centre to watch! I'd highly recommend this hotel to anyone and can't wait for the next experience back at bankside, thanks to all the staff there for looking after me and my partner you made our stay perfect xx",5,2017,02,13
120,Endless food and prosecco,"I was very tempted by the thought of endless starters, desserts and prosecco. This restaurant did not disappoint. The staff were wonderful and friendly and continuously topping up my drink. The main roast dinner was perfect, amazing roast potatoes! The only thing I would recommend is not going towards the end of the afternoon as the food starts to disappear and the live music ends around 4pm. I will definitely be returning though without a DOUBT.",4,2017,02,13
120,One of the best Hiltons around,"This has to be one of the best Hiltons I have stayed. This goes from the customer service which we received upon arrival to the checking out. 

The room quality was fantastic - no issues anywhere and complimentary items in the mini fridge. Absolutely Fantastic",5,2017,02,13
120,Everything you want .......,".....from a London hotel.  Firstly, I do not think this hotel does itself justice from website! This is a very modern, sleek and professional hotel.  All the little niggles we usually have about city hotels they had thought about and already added those extra special touches, like a bottle of water by your bed and corkscrews and wine glasses available.  My husband is a cocktail snob and yet raved about his gin cocktail that he had in the very nice bar.  For the money, I can't imagine booking anywhere else now in London for our frequent visits!",5,2017,02,12
120,Great hotel,"Best welcome at a hotel ever
Would definitely recommend this to anyone staying in London       
Staff could not do enough for me and my wife 
Got us taxis when we needed them and took our bags to our room 
Great job ",5,2017,02,12
120,Wonderful,I came up to see Rauschenberg at the tate modern with my daughter.  What a wonderful night! Well worth paying for the executive upgrade.  The staff were wonderful too.  Special mention to Phillipe at reception who made us feel so welcome. Thank you Hilton bankside - we will definitely be back!! ,5,2017,02,12
120,good location,"I was a little bit affraid bz location of this hotel but it s direct next to tate modern museum and very close to river. Also mertro station is in a walking distance. Nice bar, nice breakfast, good price",5,2017,02,12
120,Excellent Central London Business Hotel,"Stayed at this excellent central city hotel while attending a business function.

All elements of the stay were first class from check-in, quality and size of room, customer service, the function itself and breakfast.

The hotel is very modern through out.

It is located a few minutes walk from a tube station and serviced by many local bus routes.

Due to its location and standards everything is very expensive including food, drinks and breakfast which cost ~ 30 GBP per person.

If budget is not an issue then I would highly recommend this hotel for a stay in London while on business or on a short break.",5,2017,02,11
120,A really perfect Hotel!,"Everything was fine.
Staff: Very helpful and polit. I would like to thank from Klaudia in OXBO restaurant (Dinner time) She was hardworking and a real great and excellent staff. 
Gym and Pool: Very good. The gym was highly equipped but with a limited number of items
Room: Very clean and great housekeeping. 
Location: Good. 
OOXBO restaurant: Both Breakfast and dinner was great. We booked a breakfast and dinner included stay through Hilton.com and it really deserves it!",5,2017,02,11
120,work trip,"Stayed here for 5 nights early Feb 17. My work/company paid approx. £2300 for myself and a colleague for 2x rooms, bed breakfast and eve meal included.
Rooms were adequate. Had to swap all duvert/pillow as it was all duck feather - I have allergies. Food and service was under par, nice choices for breakfast, some members of staff tried to accommodate, but we got fobbed off with a limited choice of restricted menu all week, Having moaned about the sparse options they allowed us to have something of the a la carte up to £25. It was better. French fries were over cooked, plates came cold so food went cold quick, its not rocket science and basic stuff guys. I expected better.
Would have preferred a week in Premier inn with choice to eat anywhere!
Plumbing is a bit ropey I thought I heard fog horns through my stay, in actual fact it was the pipes hooting!",3,2017,02,11
120,Great southbank stay,"Very clean hotel, in a great location just behind the south bank with easy access to London Bridge, Waterloo and the restaurants and bars along the river.  Rooms were immaculate, facilities very good.  Not a cheap hotel, but if you want a classy place to stay for the night with a good pool and gym, this place should be looked at.",5,2017,02,11
120,Weekend in London,"Excelent place to stay for a weekend in London, nice location close to Tate gallery and easy to get into the city. Comfortable rooms which were very well decorated and very clean, staff were polite and helpful. Area around hotel was very modern with some good resturant to eat at reasonable cost",5,2017,02,11
120,nice hotel,"Nice hotel indeed, boring side of river but location is not bad as well. Good staff at the reception, many czech girls. Room is spacious and modern, simply but fine equipped. Nice bar in the ground floor",5,2017,02,11
120,Excellent meeting venue,"Nicely situated and easily walkable from Waterloo. Excellent service, particularly from Hannah who really looked after us. Very nicely appointed meeting rooms with good AV and climate control. The free, self-service, barista-style coffee is also excellent and was very welcome after having walked through the rain to get there.  

We ordered lunch into the room and the wagyu burger that I had was excellent. 

The only downside was no natural light but this really didn't matter as the rooms were so nicely appointed. 

Very highly recommended. ",5,2017,02,11
120,Quick stay,"Lovely clean modern rooms, fab hotel for London sights. Next time would choose an executive room if price was reasonable against other options. Will aim to try smart looking restaurant and bar if we revisit",4,2017,02,09
120,Excellent Stay,"The room was a King Size and was decorated to a very high standard. The bathroom was particularly impressive, being very spacious and modern. The room was quiet, despite being in such a central location. Staff were extremely welcoming and helpful. The location was excellent. I would definitely stay here again.",5,2017,02,09
120,The best Hilton in London,"I have stayed at the Waldorf by Hilton, a few other HIlton, and Double Tree by Hilton properties in London and none come close to this property, a new modern hotel with a great executive lounge, adequate gym, pool, and the friendliest and most attentive staff.  The email support from the reservations office (not part of this hotel but done centraly) suck but that is my only fault.",5,2017,02,08
120,Lovely hotel ,"Just a five minute walk from tube and around the corner from Tate modern. 

The hotel is lovely , probably the comfiest bed I've ever slept on and free soft drinks in the mini bar :-) 

The staff were very helpful and extremely polite. 

We were given a free upgrade due to it being my friends Birthday. 

The breakfast was busy however did not have to wait for a table , there was lots of choice for breakfast. 

Only issue was quite far out from the tourist places we had organised and therefore had to make different stops at tube stations to change. 

However once we got used to our bearings and where to change tunes this was not a problem. 

Would have liked more time to explore the local area as looked like some nice restaurants and bars around the hotel! 

",5,2017,02,08
120,"Very Good, But Not Great","I've thought long and hard about this place before writing my review as I have somewhat mixed feelings about our stay here. This is the Hilton. With the name tag comes some expectations, all of which were met, professionally and clinically. 
It is a cracking hotel. Lobby area is impressive and the deluxe room was nice, although the beautiful view of a solid brick wall, stopped well needed natural light coming in. 

What really disappointed us, was the absolutely freezing bar on the ground floor and the lack of service here. The cocktail list is not extensive, nor is it value for money. A rip off, in my opinion. On ordering, I was told the cocktail I requested (for which I could see all the ingredients) was 'not a martini, madam'. I'm not sure if he was trying to belittle me, but it was certainly condescending. When tour cocktails came, no one asked if we were enjoying our drinks (a sign of a good barman, keen to get an opinion of their creations) and no one bothered to come to us to ask if we'd like any other drinks, despite the table service. It was all a bit disappointing to be honest, especially for the high price.
Putting the bar area to one side, the upside was the breakfast. Amazing. Great service by extremely busy chefs and a great buffet choice. Couldn't ask for more. Except each time we went up to get something else, our table was cleared empty. Our full tea & coffee cups were cleared and we had to ask for replacements. Twice. 
So, whilst I feel this hotel is no doubt the Hilton standard one would expect, it's not exceptional. Would I stay again? Perhaps, although I think there are far better out there.",4,2017,02,08
120,Gorgeous hotel,"I stayed here with my husband for a weekend stay.  We had such an enjoyable stay here and we felt that the hotel and staff were superb.  All the staff were super friendly without feeling forced, the hotel was clean and had a modern feel to it.  Our room was spotless and large (we only had a standard room) and we had a good night's sleep both nights without being able to hear all the noise from next door or the corridor which is a massive bugbear for us and seems to happen at most hotels that we stay at.

Whilst there, we used the Distillery Bar a few times which had a lovely atmosphere to it and always seemed busy without being overcrowded.  We only managed breakfast the once but there was lots to choose from and if you're thinking of booking in for the Bottomless Brunch there then do it!  Again it was busy but the staff were always coming round topping up our prosecco and there was so much choice of food and plenty of it.  Definitely a highlight to our stay that we said we would do again.",5,2017,02,08
120,My top hotel pick,"I travel quite a bit for work, and Hilton Bankside is my favorite so far.  Superb staff that is friendly, helpful, and eager to make your stay as lovely as possible.  Great restaurant, rooms, workout area - and close to tube station.  Keep up the good work!  I am staying at the London Waldorf in May and can only hope for the same level of service there.",5,2017,02,07
120,Thoroughly impressed!!,"Wow! I was impressed and I mean seriously impressed. 
The idea of a chain Hilton hotel isn't always the most exciting but Hilton Bankside is not like other Hiltons, it is like a unique boutique hotel and it stands out from other London hotels I have stayed at. Funky styling, amazingly comfortable beds and bedding and staff who literally can't do enough for you.  Every staff member we encountered was friendly and helpful and actually put many 5 star establishments to shame. It is clearly a culture led by management as it didn't feel forced and my friend and I felt so welcome!
The pool area is beautiful and the staff in the health club were lovely too.
We had the roast on a Sunday in the Oxbo restaurant with unlimited bubbly which is an absolute steal and the food was of a superb quality- the starter selection alone was enough to satisy every culinary desire and they were so generous with the bubbles.
Location wise this is perfect for a weekend break- near to Borough Market- and the rooms have little fridges with complimentary drinks- so if you did but a few fresh items from the market you could easily store them! I wish i had bought that fancy truffled French brie! There is the Arches nearby which is a foodie hub and on a Sunday they have an antiques market. Loads of places to eat and the area felt safe and with a great vibe.

Kudos to the staff here- I have already booked to come back in July on the basis of the wonderful service I recieved. I can't recall a better sleep either- we slept like logs for 9 hours- absolute bliss!",5,2017,02,07
120,Early checkin,I have stayed at Hilton Bankside many times. Usually fly in from the US or Asia on a early morning flight and they've always allowed early checkin for their Diamond level guests which is such a blessing after a long flight. Gym is quite small and can get crowded at peak hours. Otherwise a great business hotel. ,5,2017,02,07
120,My weekly business hotel,The hotel is located in a quiet street only a 5 minutes’ walk from Southwark tube station on Jublee line. Walking distance to west end (25 minutes) I like the atmosphere and modern style. Helpful and service minded staff and excellent breakfast! One of the best breakfasts in town in this price range! Good vibes in the bar as well. This is one of my favorite hotels on London. Superb beds!,5,2017,02,06
120,Reliable comfort and efficiency,"Spent two nights here, Friday and Saturday. Very efficient check-in, although we arrived at midday (to leave our cases) they found us a room which was ready so we could settle in immediately. It was a bit dark with only a small window area and a view of a brick wall but was otherwise pleasant, modern and functional. The TV and wifi both worked very well. Bed was large and comfortable. Breakfast was generous as ever with a wide range of food to cater for all tastes. Thought they had no baked beans the first morning but noticed them at the back with the fried eggs if you asked for them. Very good pool, we were the only swimmers at 10.30am on Saturday morning (it was raining). Good location, 5 minutes from Southwark tube, Tate and the embankment and plenty of restaurants nearby. A reliably pleasant stay, only the rather dark room prevented 5 stars.",4,2017,02,05
120,Probably better for business travellers,"Everything is new and the room was immaculate but not quite as big as I was expecting. The staff were very friendly and helpful, and the location is great for going around London and the City. Stayed on a Sunday to take advantage of cheaper rates and feel would otherwise not be my choice any other time (hence better if your company is paying).",4,2017,02,05
120,Lovely stay,"Stayed for 2 nights in the executive king room and it was lovely. Gorgeous hotel and great service. Huge comfy bed and great selection of complimentary drinks and snacks in the inroom bar. Gorgeous bathroom with robes and slippers. We had access to the executive lounge of which both food and service was great.

Thank you for a lovely weekend. ",5,2017,02,04
120,"lounge is absolutely stand out, rest very good","The room was very nice, if small, though that's kind of the deal in London
The restaurant was ""OK"" (I already forget what I had and the server was very confused, got orders wrong, etc.).
The front desk service was excellent.
This would have been a three star review
BUT
The lounge, and especially the food in the lounge, was great (and I had breakfast there and snacks there).  Might have been one of the best breakfasts in a lounge I've had (homemade-ish Greek yogurt, smoked salmon, lots of exotic fruits and cheeses, great variety of breads and meats and eggs, all absolute top quality).",4,2017,02,04
120,Wonderful hotel stay,"This is the best London hotel I have stayed in. Very comfortable beds, excellent silver service breakfast and friendly staff. The pool was a very pleasant addition to our stay and the hotel had a grear location near the Tate.",5,2017,02,04
120,Exceeds expectations,"We use Hilton a lot and have recently not been very impressed until we stayed here. Staff are what make it. Ingrid and Sylvia in the executive lounge are so friendly, yet professional and nothing is too much trouble they are exceptional.  Beds are extremely comfy and the little extras like mat by the bed and water on bedside cabinet when you return to your room are lovely little special touches which mean we will definitely return to this hotel again... soon. We had a slight issue with hot water (not being very hot) but maintenance resolved this promptly. Thank you for a great night away Bankside!",5,2017,02,04
120,Could be a great Hotel in the Hilton collection,"Stayed previously in a variety of Hiltons in London. Good facilities especially the Executive Lounge. We all found it a little bit too warm for comfortable. What lets this Hilton down is some of the staff and Attention to Detail. Overcharged had to query bill. Had settled bill in restaurant only to find that the drinks had also been added again to final bill. Had to ask twice for the white wine to be chilled at the table. Waitress did not seem to understand basics. No one around in restaurant when we were waiting to settle bill to leave! It appeared the front of house staff are letting the staff down that are very hands on behind the scene. When I have stayed at Hiltons previously to celebrate an anniversary there is always a special little touch in the room, card, cake or a complimentary drink IN this hotel nothing at all, not so welcoming. Guest Relations Manager was disappointing on this occasion!",3,2017,02,03
120,Fantastic!,"Stayed with friends on 3rd February in an executive room - absolutely fantastic! Rooms are a good size for a London hotel, but what really makes it is the staff who are super friendly and couldn't be more helpful! Special mention has to go to Yngrid in the executive lounge who was beyond fantastic! Would definitely stay here again. ",5,2017,02,03
120,Work or Pleasure... this hotel exceeds expectations!,"Not sure why I haven't gotten to write this review on here already (my fault!) 
However let me start by saying I travel to London a fair amount for business and weekends away. Additionally I use the Hilton brand more than I would Marriott or Radisson when travelling globally on business - so have experienced a number of hotels. 
I chose the Bankside again earlier this month when in London mainly due to my previous experiences last year. 
Rooms are so comfortable. Staff are courteous, friendly and above all genuine.
Everything from breakfast, through to Exec Lounge, through to Bar food, through to a late night drink is of a high standard and served with a smile.
They acknowledge your loyalty as a HHonors customer by providing an upgrade where possible; although the standard rooms are also great.
Pool and gym are always clean and available. Wifi is consistent - which is important on web-based calls for work! Even my colleagues are now checking in here which is great as it means we can catch up in the Executive Lounge.

I'm looking to book a London hotel for my birthday later this year; and while the Bankside is not the closest to the event we are attending I don't mind the few quid in the cab to get the fantastic service they provide. 
10 out of 10 yet again!",5,2017,01,31
120,Just wonderful,"This Hilton is just wonderful. Many thanks  to everyone working here:bar,restaurant,concierge and reception,especially to Lenka  , who is very warm, helpful, extremely kind and a true professional  ..😊

All the best",5,2017,01,31
120,Hilton Bankside,This is an excellent place to relax either on business or personal trips. Staffs were extremely helpful. If you can find the ironing board upon first entry into your room then you must be a genius. Lol,5,2017,01,28
120,Super friendly staff,"Stayed here on business, world class staff at every point in this hotel. Food was great, love the seafood options in the executive lounge . Breakfast was a treat. Only criticism was drink options and prices, not enough draft beer / lager options for our party.",5,2017,01,27
120,Still wonderful ,"Keeping it short and sweet as I posted last time we stayed here but just to say it's still as absolutely wonderful as when we stayed last year! The staff make it, there isn't a single person who lets it down.
Well worth a stay ",5,2017,01,27
120,Fantastic hotel experience,"Could not have been better ... location, accommodation, service and staff. 10/10. Very modern, stylish, not like a standard Hilton hotel. Wouldn't hesitate to recommend it for business or pleasure. Location is great for London Bridge and the Thames. Service and experience on par with more premium hotels.",5,2017,01,26
120,A walk away from business,"The Hilton Bankside is a modern well furnished hotel just twenty minutes walk from St Paul's, on the South bank of the Thames. Customer service is well embedded in their daily operations and the bedrooms give you a great opportunity to sleep well.",4,2017,01,26
120,The Best Hotel Ever,"I stayed for nearly three months in 2016 and will stay for another two months at least in 2017. Beforehand I had tried out all sorts of other Hiltons, Novotels, Marriotts etc. Never will I stay anywhere in London but Hilton Bankside in the future. The staff and their politeness are what truly make this place so amazing. The reception staff in particular are always incredibly polite, formal but also genuinely kind which is so nice to see. I stayed there so long I felt I knew some of them and had to go say Hi to them when I came in each day from work. The rooms are modern, clean and well stocked for anything you could need. If anything is missing, they sort it out immediately. The location is central but not in the middle of all the horrendously busy areas. Perfect for working in the City but with a short walk to and from work. 

As breakfast goes OXBO is second to none. If you want a quick bite of pastries, fruit or want the chefs to whip you up a set of blueberry pancakes, anything is possible. Truly amazing staff, very attentive, great food and nothing is missing. The restaurant is also great for decent food rather than plain hotel grub. 

Get the executive lounge access if you can! Lovely drinks and nibbles at different times of day and once again unbeatable service. The leisure facilities are not huge but really do the job. A gym that is fitted out with the basics that allow you to exercise whatever and a beautiful swimming pool too. The wifi is great too as well as the TV and minibar. 

I honestly cannot think of a better hotel and will never stay another night in a different London hotel if I can help it. It is all down to such a beautiful hotel and such perfect service which I really really really hope never changes as the people are what make this place so fantastic. Well done Bankside. You are truly the best. I look forward to being back with you in 2 weeks time.",5,2017,01,25
120,One of the better Hiltons! And a bargain for London,"I Have stayed in many Hiltons all over the world, and was really surprised by this little gem south of the river.  Not the grandest of entrances, but three things made this hotel stand out
1. Fabulous refurbished room, with a very comfy bed
2. Really nice bar area, enjoyed the 2 for 1 happy hour
3. The restaurant, really excellent breakfast
All this at a reasonable price, and in a great location.",5,2017,01,25
120,Great hotel incredible breakfast ,"2nd time staying at this hotel. The staff are excellent, the distillery bar is great and the breakfast is really incredible. Got an upgraded room on check in for birthday celebration and cake in the room! Nice touch. Highly recommend, especially good if you want to nip to borough market for lunch, 10 minute walk! Really nice room and sound system in shower. Love it!",5,2017,01,25
120,Great hotel in a very convenient location,This is a really nice new hotel. Overall the staff were friendly and effective but the front desk staff were bit hit and miss. The rooms were modern and comfortable and reasonable value. Better than average accommodation of families compared to some other London hotels.,5,2017,01,25
120,Good standard,Stayed recently on business as part of a large group. Good standard rooms and public areas. Only criticism was plumbing seemed a bit iffy with shower and sink in my room very reluctant to drain. Would stay again but found Mondrian Sea Containers and Park Plaza to a higher standard.,4,2017,01,25
120,Hilton Bankside,"After a series of  pre visit calls with reservations and Raul we had a very good stay at this Hilton hotel.  It has great staff, great decor and wonderful beds ...  my wife didn't want to leave ours . The location is very good and the leisure facilities are great for a London City hotel .  The staff made our stay really enjoyable and we were welcomed by all .  2 niggles ... i like a pot of tea at breakfast and we had to wait a few mins to be seated but we did arrive later than the rush hour at breakfast.",5,2017,01,24
120,Excellent Hotel,I stayed here last year with my girlfriend for our anniversary. The hotel is really stylish and modern and clean. The bar was lovely and the staff very nice. However the best part for me was the outstanding mattress on the bed in our King Deluxe room. I suffer from constant back pain and i hadn't felt that comfortable in years. I am gutted that i forgot to ask the staff what mattress that was as I would love to buy one for us. If any member of staff happens to read this then if you could let me know i would be so grateful.,5,2017,01,24
120,Great Hilton experience,"If you want a good value, decent hotel in London then this should be on your shortlist.  Southwark might not seem like the obvious choice for tourists visiting London, but this hotel is literally 5 minutes from the tube station, walking distance to attractions and eateries on the South Bank, Borough Market, the Shard etc. 

The hotel itself is modern, rooms lovely and comfortable. We did have a rather lovely Junior Suite with views to the Shard, but this isn't really a hotel to choose if having a decent view is important to you. Our room also had executive lounge access, which I would highly recommend. The executive lounge is well staffed, large, comfortable, stylish and provided breakfast, afternoon tea selection and canapes and evening drinks. Also, executive rooms provide free soft drinks in the mini bar. This is definitely the best executive lounge experience we have had. 

We used the pool, which was small but welcoming, warm and very clean. We didn't try the main restaurant or Distillery Bar although they looked good.",5,2017,01,23
120,Never disappoints ,I stay at this hotel quite regularly when in London and it never disappoints. The staff is extremely welcoming. The hotel and the room design is clean and comforting. There is a good size fitness centre and the breakfast really good.,5,2017,01,23
120,"Modern, Clean, Excellent Service","Hotel location is great for doing the Bankside attractions.  Very modern and sparkling clean.  Staff went out of their way to be friendly, helpful, and welcoming. Breakfast was one of the best we have ever had in a hotel - omelettes were excellent.  The bar area is lively in the early evening and fun. Bar food was really good.  Good wines and an expert barman if you want cocktails. ",5,2017,01,23
120,The perfect hotel in London,"That hotel has many assets. 
First it's located in the heart of the great part of London (a few minutes away from the Tate Museum, the Shard, the Tames bank, the Borough Market...) and well accessible with metro and bus...
The hotel inside has been so well decorated! The breakfast and dining room is splendid and the bar lounge has a real something charming.
The hotel employees are very smiley and always available if you need any help.

An hotel I would recommend for any type of stays in London.",5,2017,01,23
120,My new favourite hotel in London,"I stay in London a lot- for work and the theatre- and without doubt in the price range this is my new favourite hotel. Every single member of staff we came into contact with was polite, helpful and most importantly genuine.
The room was large and spotless. There is a lovely (if expensive- but it is central London) bar. The high quality continued at breakfast with a wide range of choices- both healthy and less so.
The hotel is in a great location- 10 minutes’ walk to Borough Market and for us the Menier Chocolate Factory. It is just behind Tate Modern so convenient for a walk by the Thames.
I will certainly be back.",5,2017,01,22
120,"Exceptional Hotel, Beautifully finished and with exceptional service!","One night stay in January, booked via booking.com for the best price. 
Its easy to get to, just a few moments walk from Southwark station, and is beautifully finished, inside and out. 

After a brief delay checking in (There are only three desks and all were busy) the staff were exceptionally friendly, helpful and remembered us by name the morning when we checked out. 

THe rooms are superb, a very spacious bathroom, king sized bedroom and no noise from the outside, which is a positive for me, and something most other hotels in city centers fall down on. 

The area surrounding is quite quiet, and you're moments away from the Tate gallery, and only a 10 minute walk from the Shard. 

We would definitely recommend this to anyone staying in London - we will definitely return on our next trip.",5,2017,01,22
120,Hilton Bankside,"I feel the best Hilton in London, narrowly pipping the Conrad to the post. 
Always a real pleasure. The staff are always friendly without being obsequious, there is a genuine interest in making everything as good as it can, and perhaps, should be. The ambience of the hotel and the lounge is just relaxing and it always a pleasure to stay.",5,2017,01,22
120,"Wow now this is a proper hotel, modern&spotless","From the moment we arrived to the day we left, 4 days later, we found the staff to be  polite offering an excellent service. The hotel was spotlessly clean, modern and smart.
The room was spacious and well equipped with nice touches like bottles of water every night and slippers.",5,2017,01,22
120,New Year's Eve in London,"My husband and I were in London for the New Year's Eve fireworks celebration along the Thames.  This hotel was in an excellent location to our viewing location (at the London Eye).  

The hotel is beautiful inside; very modern and clean. The staff is so friendly!  The lounge offers a decent variety of drink options and canapés, and the lounge breakfast was good (not great, but I have no real complaints).

Being that it was New Year's Eve, the hotel provided party favours and hats to help us ring in the New Year. I thought that was a nice touch. 

The hotel is conveniently located within a short walk of the Southwark tube station, the Tate Modern, and The Globe theatre. Waterloo National Rail station is about a 10 minutes walk from the hotel. 

I highly recommend this hotel. ",5,2017,01,21
120,Nice hotel but just a few things let it down,"Firstly let me say that I cannot fault the staff, very attentive and welcoming and gave a great level of service. My only gripes were the service charge for everything, a barman opening a few bottles of beer, 12.5% charge, £6 a bottle for own brew beer too expensive. Also the room was lovely and clean but the TV buzzed all night and kept me awake. I'm not a great sleeper anyway but the electricity hum just did my head in so felt knackered in the morning. Don't be put off staying here as it is a great hotel but just a few little tweaks would make it better.",4,2017,01,20
120,Fantastic Hotel,One of the best hotels I have stayed in London. Would definitely return. Beautiful rooms great location and fantastic staff. Food amazing and bar area great but drinks were slightly more expensive than other hotels £37 for three drinks seems over the top.,5,2017,01,20
120,"Friendly staff, good location","As a frequent traveler to London, I wanted to stay in a new part of town. This Hilton is very clean, and close to the Tate Modern, Globe Theater, and Tower Bridge, as well as St. Paul's cathedral.  Breakfast is great with a very good assortment of offerings, and breakfast staff is helpful and communicative.",4,2017,01,19
120,Hilton London Bankside,"I stayed here for a week in early January 2017 on business. The hotel itself was fantastic, the staff were flawless and the location is brilliant.  I'm not sure how the cost compares to other hotels in the area but for quality of stay I cannot remember a better one. Highly recommended if comfortable with the price.",5,2017,01,18
120,Beautiful but priced out of range,When the British currency fell I thought prices would be reasonable but Hilton seems to have raised the prices to compensate - shame because it's a beautiful hotel   - we are trying the Mercure London bridge next month when we come,3,2017,01,17
120,Amazing stay ,"From the moment we walked in we where welcomed. 
This hotel is beautiful.
The staff are extremely friendly, helpful and made my birthday stay extra special. 
Lovely spacious room.... 
the beds are sooo comfortable.
The bar area has a lovely environment 
Just all round perfect stay 
Thank you 
Team Hilton bankside 

",5,2017,01,17
120,One of the best hotels in town!,"The hotel is located at Bankside, close to the Metrostation Jubilee Southwark, a short 5 min walk. We have to admit: it was a perfect decision to choose this hotel. Even we are not into five star hotels (price-benefit ratio) and more into four star, this time we enjoyed the stay. The staff is of course absolutely friendly. You feel warmly welcomed right from the beginning as you would expect it from a five star hotel. Even better, we arrived at 09:30 in the morning and the receptionist did everything to make a room available for us already at that time. We highly appreciated that and it was really the first time this excellent service was offered to us. Absolutely perfect!
The large and earth colored rooms are cozy and are inviting for a longer stay. They are clean and the housekeeping is doing also a turn-down service for you. So five stars are appropriate for sure. The design overall in the hotel, the bar and restaurant is brilliant. We enjoyed also a really nice indoor-pool which is in the basement of the hotel. Also there: all clean.
The breakfast is perfect! Warm dishes cooked a-la-minute, a broad selection of various bread, juices, cheese, sweets, muesli, etc. should cover most of the demands from the guests. We can strongly recommend this hotel for sure!",5,2017,01,17
120,overnight in London,this is our 2nd stay in the last 12 months andhad a lovely stay again very central for borough market and southbankthe Shard is only a short walk away and close to London Bridge and Waterloo railway stations. Breakfast was good but a little expensiv plenty of choice.Spa great nice pool and jacussi. the  staff were all very friendly and helpful.will be going back soon.,5,2017,01,17
120,The best hotel in town ,"What a wonderful time we had at this hotel, Per Granstorm you are amazing the kids absolutely loved your warm welcome and your special attention.  We'll be back soon.

All staff are great too...
Thanks again 
Samer & family ",5,2017,01,16
120,Fantastic stay!,"We booked a King Executive Room for an anniversary weekend, and enjoyed a really wonderful stay. The service was impeccable from start to finish: check in/out very smooth, and really attentive service in the Executive Lounge without it being overbearing. The location is perfect, within easy reach of some of London's greatest tourist attractions, and a lovely area for a wander. The room itself was spacious, and the facilities comfortable. We were particularly impressed by the complimentary soft drinks and snacks in the mini bar. We enjoyed complimentary drinks and canapes in the Executive Lounge on the Saturday evening, and a fantastic breakfast on Sunday morning. There was an enormous selection for the continental breakfast, and the hot food was available in a buffet style or to order for specific requests (pancakes, omlettes etc). Coffee was some of the best we've ever had in a hotel! We didn't have a chance to use the pool and gym facilities, but they looked really nice. 

The only complaint that we had was that the room was quite hot, and we didn't have the best night's sleep because of this. We were able to turn the temp. down to a minimum of 18degC, but no ability to open windows etc for fresh air. With the cosy, thick bedding, it was uncomfortably warm at times in the night. Otherwise, a wonderful stay at a beautiful hotel. Would 100% recommend.",5,2017,01,15
120,Great value and location,"Check in was prompt and the staff curtious. Our room was large and nicely decorated and had a lovely big bathroom. There is wifi available throughout the hotel and it also had  premium channels like bt sports etc

We doesn't upgrade to breakfast as we thought £25 per person was very expensive. 

 The hotel is a 2 minute walk to southwark tube which is ideal.",5,2017,01,15
120,Getting Back to the Hilton High Standards - Ever so slightly off the beaten track but worthit,"I stayed in this hotel for the first time over the last new year.

I have to say I was pleasantly surprised, a lot better than I had expected.

I stay at several Hilton's in London but I thought I would give this one a try.

Glad I did, the staff were very professional, Exec Lounge well appointed and service well

Bar had great atmosphere - restaurant offered great value for money.

Recommend you give it a try",5,2017,01,15
120,Great hotel,"Stayed recently whilst attending an event which was also hosted at the hotel. From arrival to departure I could not fault the hotel. Check-in smooth efficient and helpful. Bedroom modern, well equipped spacious and lots of quirky and nice touches. Food and service good and can't wait to return to the hotel in the future. Definitely one of Hilton's best that I have stayed in.",5,2017,01,15
120,Restoring the Brand...well for us at least,"We gave up on Hilton as a brand many years ago, but a Christmas trip to London was a great opportunity to try out this new hotel, and update our views of the Hilton brand. 

It was a really good stay at very reasonable price (we found the best price through the hotel's website). We had an elegant and very well laid out one bedroom suite with a view of modern office / residential blocks plus the Tate and away from the street, so no traffic noise at all.

The Executive Lounge was generally pleasant with breakfast, afternoon tea and early evening snacks and drinks included in the price of the suite (I saw some travel websites offer the same rooms without, and, for a higher price, with breakfast. This seems a bit dubious as the Lounge is included for suites. However I reiterate that we found the best price on the Hilton website)

Generally this was a stylish place. We experienced, over our six night stay, a very good standard of service and helpfulness. We enjoyed the location - great for walking.

Our only complaint was that the bed was very firm (presumably a function of a heavier population) but the hotel placed a couple of duvets under the base sheet which made it more comfortable. The hotel makes it very clear in its communications with customers that they welcome complaints and the opportunity to put things right...that was our experience.",5,2017,01,13
120,Fantastic hotel,This hotel was amazing really new and modern friendly staff and great gym and pool would reccomend and will definetely be back great location too i booked through BA and got 3 nights accomodation with return flights from Glasgow to london for 480 pounds for two people which i thought was a great deal cant wait to go back ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐,5,2017,01,11
120,Disappointing stay,"In the last fortnight I have stayed in 4 hotels in the Hilton Brand and unfortunately this was the worst stay.
The staff attitude and behaviour was quite poor. The management was even worse after I had advised them of the issues but no action taken.
Breakfast was also poor with lack of service.
Room was good quality though but a little dark.
The hotel is highly rated but not sure why I received such poor treatment. Maybe it was a race issue or my Hilton Hhonors Status was blue at the time of my stay. 
",1,2017,01,10
120,Fantastic,"Fab hotel, very boutique and great location close to tube and lovely local bars. Executive lounge was fantastic with great service. The room itself was really modern and stylish with a beautiful bathroom and rainshower. Would definitely recommend! ",5,2017,01,09
120,Smart & Stylish ,"Booked a one night stay for a Saturday in January.
Upgraded to a deluxe rm as a diamond member. Room was average size nicely appointed. We were on the third floor, no view. Room had a couch, desk, large TV. The drawers under the TV included a pull out fridge which included complimentary water, coke and juice.
Bathroom was roomy, no bath, rain showerhead and separate normal shower head. Usual Hilton toiletries.

Executive lounge was very stylish with some really tasty snacks during the daytime and complimentary soft drinks and a coffee machine. Canapés and wine/beer were available in the early evening and were very good too.

Breakfast was slightly disappointing in my opinion. Some staples were missing and the need to queue for eggs was annoying. The hot chocolate was awful. However I enjoyed the breakfast food. 

Throughout the hotel the staff were exceptionally friendly and helpful.

Location wise its 15mins walk from Waterloo rail/tube and about 7mins from Southwark tube. There are two convenience stores right outside, (Tesco Express & Sainsburys Local).

I've stayed at several different Hilton family hotels in London, this one was the best, it will be first one I check for my next London stay.

",5,2017,01,09
120,Great hotel ,"My husband and I stayed here for one night for a birthday treat. 
The hotel was super easy to find, close to Southwark tube, but also easily walkable to several other stations. 
It was located in a good area, both quiet and with some nice bars. 
The hotel itself was modern with a warm welcoming feel. 
The reception staff were super friendly and professional. Lovely room upgrade, which was a kind, nice touch. 
Our room was spacious, modern and very clean. The bed/pillows were super comfy. Great bathroom too. 
We would definitely return.",5,2017,01,09
120,"Fantastic service, amenities and outstanding hotel",My husband and I visited yesterday and they treated us like royalty as soon as we arrived. The room was outstanding quality and the service was special..!!! We will definitely stay there again later in the year and the prices was reasonable for what we got...! Loved it all and the staff was very personable... x they made my hubby feel extra special by having a surprise birthday cake and card in our room when we arrived! ,5,2017,01,08
120,Brilliant hotel and staff,"Only a one night stay at Hilton Bankside on the 7th of January but everything was great. Good food in the restaurant, room and hotel spotlessly clean and staff very helpful and polite. Will definitely stay again.",5,2017,01,08
120,Perfect hotel. ,"The Hilton Bankside was a lovely hotel. The staff we did have deal with us were polite, attentive and seemed to enjoy their work. 
We stayed in a double room. Room 101. 
It was a great room, the bed was super comfortable. It had tea and coffee facilities, the bathroom/ shower were to die for! Had a huge wet room type shower. It had a large Mirror and a light up small mirror with a magnifying glass, Which was amazing for my makeup! 
The room also had a small fridge which was so handy! As most hotel rooms don't have these. We aren't made of money so we were able to go to the Tesco express which is directly opposite the hotel, for drinks and food and could store it in the fridge. 
The only Downfall if I had to extremely critical about the room is that they only had one set of slippers and a bathrobe for a COUPLE but that's only a small
Minor. 

The breakfast was great, had a wide range of options. Everything from a hot full English breakfast, continental including a large variety of parties, muffins. Cereals, loads of fruit, seeds and nuts.  Salmon, cheeses, meat and bread. Again the only tiny downfall is....
The staff weren't extremely informative about our options? They could probably do with having a little menu on the table even though it's self serve. As the chefs would prepare you omelettes and pancakes and we had NO idea we could request that. I would've loved a pancake, however by the time I found this out I had already ate. 
So the food was great, however the lack of information was a little gutting, as I would've loved a pancake and couldn't get one! Hence the loss of a star. But it's only a slight niggle. 

All in all we had a pleasant stay! ",4,2017,01,08
120,Excellent Location and Very Good Service,"We stayed at the Hilton Bankside for 2 nights post-Christmas. Amazing location 5 minutes walk to Southwark station, with convenience stalls just outside the hotel. Staff was friendly and helpful, recommended brunch cafes as we didn't pay for breakfast at the hotel.",4,2017,01,08
120,Top Notch Hilton,"Our family of four spent 2 weeks in the U.K. from mid December until Dec. 31.  Hilton Bank side was our first of four Hilton properties that we stayed in- it spoiled us... and the other three could not compare.  Excellent staff.. wonderful helpful concierge, friendly, hard working staff in the Executive lounge and housekeeping.  Room was quiet and large, beds were the most comfortable.  Only complaint was the lack of good lighting in the room.  Would absolutely recommend this property if staying in London.  Very short walk to Underground station.  My husband said that the only problem with the hotel was that nothing else for the remainder of the two week vacation could measure up.",5,2017,01,07
120,Fantastic London stay,"Took at lot of time researching which hotel I was booking as it was for my wife's 30th birthday surprise. The Hilton Bankside really was top class from we first entered the hotel until we left. The thing that stood out the most was the customer service of every single member of staff we encountered on our stay was amazing, we really were treated like VIPs. We had booked an executive room, which I think is really worth it for the little extras you get plus use of the lounge throughout the day! Location wise was great as the area around us was relatively quiet and its only a couple of minutes walk from train and underground stations. Really looking forward to returning here again",5,2017,01,07
120,New year getaway,"Staff were very friendly, efficient & helpful. Location great for theater district and shopping areas. Oxbo restaurant great for breakfast. Nearby other great places to eat for variety. Room was a good size and quiet. Executive lounge was great for relaxation.
",5,2017,01,07
120,"Great Location, Great Hotel, Great Staff","We used the hotel for a family event in London and the Bankside location was perfect for where we wanted to be. The booking process which required some coordination was handled brilliantly by the staff. On arrival all of the arrangements were delivered as promised. From the moment of check in for the various members of our party we realised that this had a special feel. It meets all of the Hilton standards but goes further as it feels like you are in a boutique hotel. The rooms are well appointed. The lounge is excellent with high quality food a drink. Every member of staff we interacted with were superb, the doorman, the concierge, the lounge staff, the check in/checkout  - everybody. Without doubt the best Hilton we have visited.",5,2017,01,07
120,Impressed ,"Very impressed with the quality of service and standards,  very attentive staff who all looked like they enjoyed being there.  Would definitely recommend to any business, leisure and family visit. The rooms were immaculate and the restaurant had the best breakfast selection ",5,2017,01,07
120,Great one night stay ...,"Stayed here for one night for our office Christmas party nearby. Booked an Executive Room for a treat and were very pleased with it. Comfy beds, modern lay out, good shower. Breakfast in the Executive lounge was also very good.

The staff at this hotel were really welcoming and polite from the front desk, concierge, bar and chambermaids. My husband and I travel frequently and both commented on this.

The location of the hotel close to tube lines, near the Embankment and a 15 minute walk to Waterloo station all add to the positives for booking a stay here.

Would definitely return. Thanks for making our short stay a memorable one.",5,2017,01,05
120,Another fabulous visit to the Bankside,"This was our second visit to the Hilton Bankside which again was fabulous.  We were pleasantly surprised to be given an upgrade despite booking a standard room this time and were actually put in the exact same room as before.

The bathroom and bedroom are lovely and the free (except for alcohol) minibar is a lovely touch.

The breakfast was again lovely.

We will return!",5,2017,01,05
120,A great place to stay. Made better still by the team working there.,The first thing you notice is the warm friendly welcome that greats you on arrival. The quality and cleanliness of the room was exactly and what you would expect from a 5* property. The quality of the food in the executive lounge was the best I've experienced in the UK. Same for the level of detail at breakfast. A job well done by the Hilton Bankside London. Thank you.,5,2017,01,05
120,Great experience,"Spent a night to go and see New Year firework in London this year. Great base easy walking distance. Rooms where spacious and well appointed. Staff very good and very attentive. Make use of the executive lounge, you may have to pay more however good value for what it offers",5,2017,01,04
120,Between Christmas and New year,"This is an outstanding London Hotel. The greeting in the lobby and the front desk management was perfect we were one hour ahead of the scheduled room availability but no problem the room was ready. It was the one we had selected the day before on line via the Hilton App. The room was fully prepared with a large bathroom and walk in Rain Shower, large flat screen built in smart TV. Free internet connection. We could just see the river through the buildings. The fitness although a mite small was well equipped with brand new machines, next to the swimming pool. As we were in an executive room nice teas in the afternoon followed with a light buffet and all drinks included, plus the room included breakfast outstanding value for money. When booking make the calculation with the upgrade to executive room. Location 5mins walk from the tube and 5 mins walk to the Tate Modern and river front perfect. I have stayed in a lot of London Hotels I would use this one as my preference in the future. Tube to Westfield shopping center 20 Mins. The hotel staff 10 out of 10 performance well done to you all that we had contact with.",5,2017,01,04
120,Christmas in London,"Just got back from my European trip. Stayed here for 3 nights.  Great stay.  Nice location, nice rooms with Comp mini bar (water and soda).  

Nice pool.  Needs a hot tube or a sauna.  Peter at the bar was awesome.  Helped with a bunch of suggestions.  Great guy and asset to the Hilton organization. Breakfast staff was good,as well. 

Don't expect any recognition for Gold members.  Including no access to lounge. 

Very quite at night.  Need to cab it for bars or pubs.  

",4,2017,01,04
120,Outstanding!,"Stayed for one night on New Year's Day - didn't spend much time in the room as was attending a party at nearby bankside vaults (for which the location was perfect) but was very impressed with the hotel itself, the modern rooms, great pool and gym facilities and all for a bargain price!

The staff were also very helpful and gave me a free room upgrade and late checkout the following day, which was much appreciated! Would definitely recommend.",5,2017,01,03
120,Hilton Bankside - Best Hilton ever,"The hotel location, staff and food made for my most enjoyable Hilton stay ever and I would highly recommend this hotel to anyone. The hotel is really well located in London with super access to busses and the underground which made it really easy to get to and from. I cant speak highly enough about this hotel - I will definitely be going back.",5,2017,01,03
120,The best Hilton in the world,"This is the second time I have stayed at the Hilton bankside and I have to say I can't wait to come back again.

We stayed here over NYE for 2 nights. The staff are very attentive but in a discreet non over the top way. 

We parked the car using the valet service. It seems pricey at £40 per 24hrs. However having checked Parkopedia for other car parks in the area it was very reasonably priced in comparison and it is a nice touch to not have to worry about your bags etc as they are delivered to your room.

The breakfast is exceptional. The best hotel breakfast selection.

I love this hotel and I am already planning the next visit. By far my favourite hotel in the world.",5,2017,01,02
120,Perfect place in London!!!!,The hotel Hilton London Bankside was perfect. The location is 2 minutes from the Tate Museum. 5 min walking from the underground. The breakfast was very good! It was very comforting to come after a long day to the Hotel. Highly recommended!!!!!,5,2017,01,02
120,Perfect New Year's Eve Stay,"We were here to celebrate NYE in London and the hotel was the perfect spot to eat, sleep and start any touristic trip! The breakfast was over the top delicious, with every item one could wish for: from warm waffles to salmon and fresh juices! The staff was friendly and welcoming. On our first day we arrived at 9 o'clock and immediatly got a room AND breakfast within 30 minutes. Our room was comfy and modern, only the window was tiny, but on the fifth floor even with a view to the St. Pauls Cathedral and Tate Modern. The swimming pool at the hotel was great too, with a little Jacuzzi. Near the hotel are within a walk the Millennium Bridge, Borough Market and the Globe Theatre and many shops and Cafés. We enjoyed our stay and would recommend this to any tourist in London. ",5,2017,01,01
120,A Christmas Haven,"We stayed here whilst visiting our daughter over Christmas and arrived very tired on Christmas evening.  The receptionist, Eva, could not have been more helpful as we upgraded our to an Executive room on the first floor.

The room was of a generous size and well-equipped, the beds so large and comfortable we slept like logs after raiding tbe free mini-bar for mineral water and orange juice.  The bathroom was just perfect with fluffy towels and good toiletries.

Breakfast in the Executive Lounge was good with both hot and cold dishes available but we would have appreciated a pot of coffee rather than an over-strong cupful delivered from a press-button machine.  Cereals included porridge.

Quite often hotels of this quality are let down by the customer care training of their staff but I really must emphasise the outstanding service we received from all members of the Bankside staff for the duration of our stay for whom absolutely nothing was too much trouble.  The Hotel Manager and HR Department are to be congratulated.  We would certainly stay at Bankside again and recommend it to others, too.  Our previous experience at other Hilton hotels came nowhere near this ideal.

The room was outstandingly equipped, the beds so comfortable we slept like logs after raiding the free minibar",5,2017,01,01
120,Great stay,"Free minibar, comfy beds, great executive club lounge food & drinks variety and quality, cool location near supermarkets, museums, tubes, markets, tourist attractions. Staff were friendly and responsive. Definitely recommend!",5,2016,12,31
120,Superb,"Excellent hotel, fantastic experience will definitely stay here again.  Most of central London is within easy access on either 1 or 2 tubes.  Staff in the hotel were a joy to deal with.  Definitely worth paying to use the exec lounge.",5,2016,12,31
120,PERFECT HOTEL ! BANKSIDE HILTON!,"I stayed at hilton Bankside during 28-30 Dec 2 night 3 days for celebrating my 50th birthday.
I touched my heart with per granstorm's kins and warm attitude. 
He introduced me Hilton Bankside last year and recommend at hotel.

120,Fabulous hotel,Great hotel much better than expected. Staff were very good indeed. Better than some of the usual 5 stars I stay in. Fire alarm went off about 0030 and hotel was evacuated. All dealt with very efficiently but staff. ,5,2016,12,30
120,Well done,"Seriously. Well done. Years ago staying in London was a horror show. Overpriced. Smallest of rooms and worst imaginable service.   Times have changed. For the better. And. This Hilton venue moves things even further. 

THE most friendly reception staff. Great new decor and modern room. Bar cool and ambient. (although maybe the food in the bar could be less ""deep fried""). Room views are never going to be great. But hey. Minor trifles. Great location for walking or tube. 

Been a Hilton honours card holder for many years. Love the London Bridge venue. This I have to say is as good. Even without the Shard. 

A hotel well done.

120,Very good,Friendly staff. Generous room and bathroom with big shower. Good location close to the train station and POI. Will definitely come for visit. Breakfast is very expensive though. All in all it's a very very good experience.,5,2016,12,30
120,Wonderful Stay!,"Hiltons are so reliable for when I'm staying in London, this time for a Christmas 2 days with my friend. We decided to stay closer to central this time and it was a perfect location, just a 3 minute walk to Southwark tube station and Waterloo overground. The hotel was the most immaculate I've ever seen a Hilton and that's saying something!
The staff were the friendliest I've ever experienced at a Hilton also and gave us any information needed upon request. Bedrooms were very very cosy and comfortable and again, also very clean. The only trouble I had was the lack of lighting in our room but other than that, it was perfect. I would highly recommend this hotel to anybody.",5,2016,12,30
120,Eating at the Oxbo,Booked a meal here. Excellent value for money. Staff very attentive and charming. Had 3 courses all presented to a very wry high standard. Highly recommend the restaurant. Hotel reception was luxurious and very tempted to book a room and stay here in the New Year. Close to the Southbank and London Bridge Station. ,5,2016,12,29
120,MODERN ROOM; GREAT BAR ATMOSPHERE,"We spent one night here the weekend before Christmas.
The room was very modern with clean lines; the only negative was the lack of light, as the walls were all very dark and therefore absorbed much of available light.
After a night out with friends, we came back to the bar for drinks.  We'd noticed the atmosphere there in the afternoon and by night it was terrific.  The drinks were very expensive, however.
Cooked breakfast was served in a modern and quirky dining room.",4,2016,12,29
120,Enjoyed our stay,"This is a lovely hotel about 5 minutes walk to the nearest tube station. The décor is lovely and staff were friendly and attentive. The rooms were lovely with fab showers!

The hotel is expensive, but so are other good hotels in London so it's all relative!

The bar area was nice for an evening drink and breakfast was very very good!",5,2016,12,29
120,Good hotel,"We booked 4 suites at the hotel, one of the suites were upgraded due to our Hilton Gold status. With the suites, we had access to the executive lounge.
I was seriously not overly impressed with the check in staff, we asked if any upgrades available and he said no rooms, but later managed one room, gave the impression he was not really trying hard enough at first. He tried to say he gave us lounge benefits but It was actually part of the room type we booked. Then he said there's a charge for rollaway beds of 50 per night, and we said proceed. Then he said there's no charge since we settled with the hotel previously. The way he was changing his words made us unsure of what's going on. 
Our cards had problems accessing the lounge a few times, the lounge did not had a lot of food - or maybe I went at odd hours, I am unsure. There was certain hours with free flow of alcohol which was great for drinkers. 
The suite was good though, the room was big and clean but faced a office building. There was complimentary snacks and non alcoholic drinks which we appreciate. 
I would say the hotel was very good, but did not wow me overly in service, room standards or lounge and I would likely stay closer to the shopping areas in future :)",4,2016,12,29
120,One night stay,"Visiting London from Australia to attend staff Christmas party and catch up with colleagues. At short notice booked a room in the hotel as it was close to my office and our Christmas celebrations. This was pretty straight forward, finding hotel accommodation very easy, checkin seamless. The staff were very inviting and helpful. The hotel is very nice and new. The room I stayed in was very well appointed and extremely comfortable. The bathroom had all the expected condiments and relatively large. On arrival to my room I found the bed was so comfortable and I slept all night without a break (according to my Fitbit). Woke up and checked out with ease. I have to say this hotel provides a perfect reception through to checkout when traveling to London. The staff are ever so helpful. This hotel is a great place to stay when visiting London. ",5,2016,12,28
120,Christmas in London,My favourite hotel in London. High standard. Comfortable bed. Nice decor. Friendly staff. Great bar. Breakfast is well presented and delicious. Only a few minutes from St. Paul's cathedral and London Bridge. Relaxing big size pool.,5,2016,12,28
120,Meh...,"My feelings on Hilton Bankside are lukewarm. The staff is great! Warm, friendly and responsive.

The lobby and bar are gorgeous, especially decorated for Christmas.

The guest rooms are entirely unexceptional. From the hallway carpets, wall color and art to the finishes in the rooms the choices are just not very well chosen. I'd go as far as calling them tacky. The photos I saw indicated a level of luxury that just wasn't there. The beds were quite hard.

After complaining we were immediately given an extra comforter and then a room change.

That didn't solve the problem, but made me feel a little better.

Not enough to make us move hotels and risk being even more dissatisfied, but wouldn't stay again.",3,2016,12,28
120,My business hotel in London !,"This was my second stay during the last 2 months. Great hotel with friendly and helpful staff. Very good breakfast with servers assisting with tea, coffee, juice etc., etc. I had a deluxe room which was very clean. Bed was excellent. Staff at the executive lounge was very helpful with an early breakfast as I had to check out very  early. Last, but NOT least...an extremely friendly and helpful concierge at the front ! I will definitely return ! ",5,2016,12,27
120,Absolutely Incredible - I plan to return!,"I cannot sufficiently praise the Hilton Bankside!  It is an amazing Hotel starting with check-in on arrival, the amazing comfort of the bed!, the cleanliness of the rooms, and on to the wide variety offered in the breakfast buffet. I especially want to mention Lenka!  She greeted me when I arrived from overnight flight from the US.  Since I cannot sleep on planes and I was seated next to a very ill child coughing and sneezing on me the entire trip I arrived extremely cranky! Lenka's warm & pleasant greeting turned my day around for the better as she brought cheer. Frankly, I was so miserable when I arrived that any insincere attempt at a warm greeting would have terribly irritated me! 

I also must mention the Hugo in the executive lounge as he was very friendly and attentive.  Whilst referencing the executive lounge, I must say it is the nicest of any Hilton I have visited. Both the food and drink offerings and the comfort/décor are outstanding.

The room was very clean and modern and the bed was the BEST!!!  

The breakfast buffet offered sufficient choices to please anyone. There is an omelet station, a wide variety of breads and pastries, meats & cheeses, fruits, etc. etc. etc. I am already trying to plan a return visit!",5,2016,12,27
120,Great nights stay,"stayed  here for one night. Lovely modern hotel,centrally located the room was great, spotlessly clean, staff were very efficient and friendly. We had a deluxe room but if your staying here for a few days get an executive room as it includes free access to lounge with free drinks and afternoon tea. ",5,2016,12,25
120,Great hotel with quality services,"Hotel staffs are friendly and kind they will meet your needs in all possible ways. Room is clean and tidy with state of the art technology, overall the hotel is worth for its price and we will definitely come visit again.",5,2016,12,24
120,Short break,"Everything was fantastic. It was a special treat for my husband, son and his fiancé.
Well worth the money, we don't normally indulge in 5 star accommodation but felt this 2 night stay was worth it.
Great location too",5,2016,12,23
120,Blown away! One of a kind hotel!!!!,"As a Suprise from my boyfriend we want on a citytrip to London.  This hotel is magnificent! The look and feel will instantly blow you away. From arrival till check out and luggage drop off at the concierge. All is great utterly in the finest details.  We stayed on the second floor in a beautiful design room as we haven't seen before. A unique comfort boxspring with all the details in place when you go to sleep. Lovely! I must say we travel a lot in high-end and also boutique hotels! So this is a big fat compliment! Keep these standards up! Every thing so clean and logical built to our comfort. Also the hotel swimming pool with jacuzzi is a must after a day browsing around the city! Every single one who works there is committed. They are well educated and trained to see there guest as a family. Extremely rare these days!!!! Also a very large and ""I can't choose what to eat"" assortment also not ""English"" at breakfast! Also the specially baked egg with herbs was wonderfull! The only downside was that I had to go home again. But paradise has to come to and end sometime! Will be back soon 😉 lots of respect and gratitude to this wonderfully equip of staff!!!!! You are key!",5,2016,12,22
120,Best London 5 Star Hotel Ever,"This was our first stay at the Hilton Bankside and our room was perfect for us on arrival from the long flight from Australia. It was a really large room which is quite unusual in London. (We visit London each year and it's very hit and miss regardless of the cost we pay per night.) This was our best find ever with quality linen and pillows, a huge comfy bed and a spotless new bathroom with sumptuous towels. It was also really quiet - we heard no one. Just a 5 minute walk to the tube and we were in Oxford Street shopping in a flash. There was also a Sainsbury's right next door and a generously sized fridge in the room. The staff were super friendly and professional. The wifi worked perfectly... honestly we both agreed this is the best 5 star hotel we've stayed in in London. We will definitely be back in a few weeks.  PS loved the classy Christmas decorations!",5,2016,12,22
120,"New hotel, beautifully decorated for Christmad","The hotel is of a good quality, the rooms were a decent size well decorated, very clean,very comfortable bed and pillows.The bathrooms were a good size, large power shower( I would prefer a bath!) . The staff were very helpful and cheerful. ",5,2016,12,21
120,Excellent London base,"Loved this hotel, feels very new and fresh.  Great links to transport - tube is 5 mins walk away. Room was spacious and very clean, quiet and super comfy bed!   Couldn't ask for more really, would definitely stay here again when in central London.",5,2016,12,20
120,Amazing!,I have not stayed in a Hilton in a while and this place was awesome. The lobby decor was next level nice with the holidays. Everyone was massively friendly.  I would totally stay here or another Hilton again.,5,2016,12,19
120,realy nice location close to the underground,"The hotel was in very good condition,the rooms were clean and generally the whole service was fantastic.Begining with the persons at the reception and the person at the concierge they were all fantastic and very helpfull for any information that you would like to know.The breakfast was amasing with a grat variety of food and beverages.",5,2016,12,19
120,The best Hilton we've stayed in,"I've stayed in quite a few hiltons over the years and this one is the best! The Hilton brand are always of a high standard but this one tops that with lovely staff who are helpful, friendly and accommodating. The rooms are really comfy and the whole hotel has a nice layout & decor, nothing to fault and defiantly would stay again! ",5,2016,12,17
120,"Fabulous ambience, excellent value, great location","We have now stayed at this hotel a number of times and will most certainly return. The decor is modern and chic and this extends from the lobby, bar and restaurant to the rooms which are a generous size and well appointed. The executive lounge is one of the best we've experienced across the Hilton chain. Often Hilton hotels can feel a little tired and worn but this place is contemporary and hip. For now, the prices are really good value too.",4,2016,12,17
120,Great hotel and staff !,"Stayed in that beautiful hotel last weekend! Great location 10 mins from the shard and great 20 mins walk to London eye and Covent Garden ! The pool was great and the room was huge and modern ! Staff was excellent , special thanks to Darshi, Ana Maria and Anais !! Will stay again for sure !!!",5,2016,12,14
120,A revalation ....,"Well, we have been staying on our London visits at the Park Lane Hilton for the past 25 years which is now old, scruffy, poorly managed with terrible food, so finding this place has made us very happy. Our new home in London. We have both been Diamond Members ever since Diamond was introduced and average about 50 Hilton stays a year on business and pleasure, so our commitment to the brand has never wavered, but it did wobble with our last few visits to the Park Lane Hilton. We checked in yesterday which was a good experience from Valet Parking to the lovely receptionist. Our room is gorgeous and the soft drinks and snacks in the mini bar are complimentary. And the Lounge, now it is wonderful that some thought has been put into the location, decor and comfort levels of the Executive Lounge. The food, drinks and service are impeccable. The restaurant is simply stunning, the best meal ever in a Hilton with again, impeccable service and top value. My compliments to the management of this very fine hotel, you have obviously worked hard to deliver the highest standards of quality and comfort for your guests, you achieve at all levels and we will be recommending this hotel far and wide.",5,2016,12,13
120,Fabulous Hotel,"I recently attended this venue for my wife's company Christmas party. We stayed in an executive room on the 7th floor, fabulous room. The room for the party was very well presented, the staff were exceptional & very professional. The food was very good. A really good night was had. The room service full English breakfast was to die for. Thank you Hilton Hotel Bankside",5,2016,12,12
120,Simon,Absolutely wonderful hotel and service. From arrival with the extremely helpful Trudi at reception who checked us in early and took care of our luggage whilst we ventured out to explore the city and winter wonderland whilst our room was prepared. Received a text to inform us when our room was ready and bags were awaiting in our room on our return. Excellent service and friendly welcoming staff; would recommend to anyone wanting that something extra special staying in the city.,5,2016,12,11
120,brilliant,"This is not your normal Hilton. Just stayed here for an overnight in London.
Great location for our purposes.
Obviously newly 'done' but really WELL done.
Greeted by the doorman who helped us with parking the car so that we didn't have to pay to park, despite the hotel car park being full.
The room was lovely and the on-site facilities (bar and restaurant) were very good.
This is our new base for weekends in London",5,2016,12,11
120,Fantastic service!,"I just returned from a week at the Hilton London Bankside. I was in London on business and our office is just around the corner, so it was perfectly located for a 5 minute commute into work. But, even if I was returning to London on holiday, I would likely choose this hotel, again -- it's that good! It's very well located in Southwark, within easy walking distance to the Tube (Southwark station) and regional trains (Blackfriars, London Bridge and Waterloo Stations). You are also very near Shakespeare's Globe, the London Eye, Tate Modern, Millennium Bridge and London Bridge. 

The hotel is fairly new and decorated in a trendy, almost ""boutique"" style, in shades of charcoal grey. The rooms are sized more like U.S. hotel rooms and I never felt claustrophobic in any part of the room or hotel. There is an excellent bar off the lobby called The Distillery and an onsite restaurant (that I never tried). There is also a decent fitness center in the basement with primarily cardio machines and a very lovely Executive Lounge, serving breakfast, cocktail and snacks at all times of the day.  I enjoyed the Executive Lounge each morning for a continental breakfast with a wonderful array of creamy eggs, porridge (with all sorts of provided ""add-ins"" like nuts, dried fruits and honey). The staff even offered to make me a waffle or pancake, if I so desired. It's gorgeously decorated in there and very comfortable for solo dining or breakfast meeting. I never ended up going there in the afternoon/early evening, however, so can't comment on what is provided during those times.

The bed was extremely comfortable with high thread-count linens and delightfully squishy down pillows. The towels were lush, fluffy and large and the shower featured both a rain showerhead plus additional directional showerhead, reminiscent of the ""Heavenly Bath"" in Westin hotels. The floor of the shower was slate & all bath amenities were from Paul MItchell. I had a few small complaints about the bathroom, however. First, the lighting was never bright enough for proper makeup application -- even the lighted cosmetic mirror was somewhat dim. Second, there isn't an electrical outlet in the bathroom that fits the plug for the provided hair dryer! Thus, you have to dry your hair in the main part of the room, using the mirror on the back of the closet door.

The real stars of this hotel, however, are its staff. From the moment of check-in, every staff member I encountered went out of their way to make my stay special. In particular, Per at the Front Desk was not only helpful when asked for something, but even predicted what I might need during my stay (he, somehow, knew I had forgotten my UK electrical adapter and sent up a transformer for me to use for the length of my stay for all of my US devices). Any time I would call down to the desk during my stay, every request was fulfilled within mere minutes.

I can't wait to return to London and the phenomenal staff at the Hilton Bankside.",5,2016,12,11
120,Great Stay,"First time stay here at the end of November. Upgraded to Executve room with lounge access as Hhonors Diamond member. Loved everything about this new London Hilton. Very nice room with comfortable bed and bathroom with walk-in shower. Air conditioning very effective and also very quiet.  Executive lounge was excellent and staff very friendly and helpful, especially Gergely. They continually came round to see if any more drinks required, but you could also self serve.  Good choice of beers, wines and spirits available. Full buffet Breakfast for Diamonds could be taken in the restaurant which we did each morning. Service was good and no waiting for tables even though hotel was very busy.  Will definitely return to this Hilton.",5,2016,12,11
120,"Great location, nice hotel","Hotel is new and all accessories are well appointed. Hotel staff is charming and eager to assist. Concierge service was extremely friendly and helpful. Restaraunt was great! Room service food so-so.

Hotel is located just a couple of blocks from the Jubilee line tube station. Excellent!

Room was nice, but small, although we upgraded to the fifth floor.  No dresser space at all. We were here a week and I lived out of my suitcase.  Oddly the bathroom socket did not fit for a hair dryer.  We had occasional gnats or fruit flies in the room, which was a bit bothersome.  I didn't complain, as my wife didn't want any pesticide in the room.  They ended up finding their way into glasses of wine. (Note hairdryer plug and fruit flies were mentioned by other guests. Hotel should address).

Overall we enjoyed our stay.  Have stayed at more luxurious hotels in London, but this is so close to Westminster, the tower, the Burroughs, bridge that we would stay here again.",4,2016,12,11
120,One of the best Hiltons I´ve stayed in.,"Having spend hundreds of nights in Hiltons around the globe, I must say this is outstanding. Very modern rooms, lot of attention to details & decoration and a great location. Good chance that the Bankside Hilton will be my new standard hotel for London.",5,2016,12,10
120,BEST HILTON YET !,"On arriving at the hotel,wonderfully warm welcome at reception ...upgraded to exec.room ...terrific room,exec.lounge,bar,breakfast,pool,concierge ....warm,helpful staff ...would be unfair to name individuals as all were a credit to the hilton brand ...great location...walked everywhere since the weather obliged ...beautiful decor/ambience...Mr.Fox was discreetly present throughout hotel !...usually stay around Hyde park area,but not now...will most definitely be back...stayed in Hiltons worldwide,but without doubt, this is the best yet .. if this is 'new generation hilton',then keep them coming please !",5,2016,12,08
120,Great location,Had a great stay the room was of a very high standard. I did not use the Restaurants but the bar was great and the staff were very helpful. Lots of gin. Your in a great location plenty of bars and restaurants close. I will use it again.    ,5,2016,12,07
120,Good London Hotel,Quite luxurious hotel - the bed was so big and cosy. Staff are very efficient and friendly.  The hotel restaurant was very good.  Good for couples on a romantic weekend.  Would definately stay here again.,5,2016,12,07
120,A Special Graduation,"Our daughter chose this hotel as the base for her graduation (MSc) from Queen Mary University of London. Well located, superb facilities, with the room quite excellent, friendly and helpful staff, and a great bar tender!",5,2016,12,07
120,Comments of my pleasant experience at Hilton Hotel at Bankside in London,"This was my first stay in this hotel. should I register my contentment with the splendid reception was offered immediately upon arrival. Had no booking; Even so, the receptionist was very helpful and got a room for a few days. There was an arrangement that was transferred for one night to another hotel of the group. I returned later to the Bankside hotel, where I stayed until the end of my stay in London. I felt that I was treated as a member of the Hilton family.",5,2016,12,06
120,Exceptional Service ,"I was supposed to meet a friend somewhere in the area, as I arrived too early I was looking for somewhere to keep myself warm and I saw this hotel so I went in, at first I was a little bit apprehensive as I wasn't staying but as I approaching the bar Adrian greeted me with smile as i was not sure what to have he quickly made suggestions which I go for, he was so welcoming make me feel valued as a customer as well as I enjoyed the conversation which also joined by Csabi, Marcelia and  Rita. My plan was to have only one drink but as I felt so welcome I ended up with four drinks. They are so lovely, friendly also very professional, they are truly best asset to Hilton.",5,2016,12,06
120,"Wonderful stay, excellent staff!",We always stay in a Hilton in London every December but this is the best so far.  The staff are so friendly and helpful! Breakfast selection was brilliant and a good location. Would highly recommend! Executive Lounge had a good selection of food and drink available.,5,2016,12,06
120,Great stay,Very nice stay. The breakfast is very nice and very good service. Very sillent area. The service standard is very high and we felt spoiled and relaxed returning from sightseing. Very nice area to stay and we enjoyed to visit the Borough Market very near by.,5,2016,12,05
120,Excellent hotel,Lovely hotel in great quiet location. Club room was excellent value for money. Bed & pillows super comfy. Hotel staff are a credit to the hotel in all areas. Easy to get to all parts of London but quiet in the evening to get a good sleep. ,5,2016,12,05
120,Excellent Service,"My stay could not have been as excellent as it has been if it wasn't for the excellent service with received.

I cannot thanks Yngrid, from the executive lounge area enough for her professionalism and her friendly attitude. 

Once again, thank you to all the staff fo making our break away so memorable.

120,"Nice hotel, good location","The Hilton Bankside is situated in a very central location. Whether you go for business or on holiday, you will be close to everything! 
I have been staying there for business in average every other week since January 2016 and I have to say, the staff has always been lovely and very helpful. 
Rooms are spacious and modern. The hotel is only just over a year old so all rooms are still in very good condition. The only slightly negative point is that the windows are fairly small in the rooms. Having said that, I usually don't spend that much time in the room, so it is not too much an issue.",4,2016,12,04
120,Great location,"We recently stayed at the Hilton bankside in an executive room and were extremely impressed with the whole hotel. Our room was fantastic with a huge walk in shower which is rare in many other hotels of the same category. Complimentary toiletries were plentiful. Our bed was very comfortable and the room was a good size. As an executive room we also had complimentary soft drinks from the mini bar which is an additional extra we did not know about and certainly gave us a wow factor. The hotel is very modern and extremely clean. The staff in any part of the hotel are very welcoming and Sr. Ice was very good. I especially would like to say the service the the executive lounge was exceptional. The staff never stop in here serving customers and always with a friendly smile. They also had to put up with other customers expecting food after the limited time for the buffet and dealt with this very professionally under difficult circumstances. The buffet on an evening was very good with choice of prawns, cold meats, breads, cheese. Having stayed in other executive lounges I would say the complimentary breakfast option was limited. I tend to have fruit and yoghurt which was very good but for someone wanting hot food there was sausage, bacon and scrambled egg. the price of drinks in the bar were expensive . I would certainly stay here again and have already recommended to friends for any stay they have in London.",5,2016,12,04
120,New hotel offering 5 star service,"Upon looking for Hilton Hotels near my meeting this came up the closest. I was unsure at first due to how new it looked and in keeping with the local modern surrounding. My boss spent 4 days here and is quite critical of large Hotel chains.

The room was expensive and very comfortable, the staff can't do enough for you and the main Bar is very inviting.

We didn't eat in the Hotel so couldn't comment. Needless to say he has booked the same hotel for his return trip in December.

The rates aren't cheap but are worth it.",5,2016,12,03
120,City short break,"Hilton Bankside is a fairly new hotel and it shows, the decor throughout the hotel is really nice and the rooms are very well decorated and appointed. Check in was done online so at the hotel desk it was easy and painless. Hotel has valet parking a little bit expensive but for ease of use it's worth it. In house restaurant, Oxbo, was very good. 
As in everything attention to detail is important and in our room we had tea and coffee making facilities but we didn't have any milk and no bottled water in the fridge. There also wasn't any shower caps. It was quickly dealt with by the staff but in a hotel this expensive they should check the room for everything before letting guests occupy it. 
The walk in shower is good but not the water that runs right across the floor because there's nothing to stop it. 
The hotel is ideally placed to deal with attractions from Tower Bridge up to Westminster bridge and across the river to St Paul's and then Covent Garden all within easy walking distance. 
Would recommend this hotel to anybody, expensive but well worth it",5,2016,12,02
120,Great service and location,What a great experience at this Hilton property. The service from the reception desk to valets was to notch. The bartenders at the hotel bar were awesome and gave lots of tips for a first time visitor to London. Location made everything easy. Tube stop a couple minutes walk. The room was clean and modern with a good workspace and strong wifi. ,5,2016,12,02
120,My preferred hotel in London,"This hotel is probably one of my favourites to stay in when in London - I've stayed here twice now and I have another booking for my next trip to London in February 2017. The staff are always friendly and helpful without being obsequious. The rooms are comfortable and well appointed - some people may consider them a bit small but for me they are fine; when I am visiting a city I don't spend much time in the hotel so I don't need a massive room. The bathroom is a good size with a spacious shower. There is free wifi which is always a bonus. The hotel is located a few minutes walk from a tube station for easy access to the rest of London or if you like to walk (which is the best way to discover London) you can reach areas like Borough Market, Covent Garden, Leicester Square or St Paul's within 30 minutes. There are a few restaurants, pubs and supermarkets close to the hotel which can be useful. It is not the cheapest hotel but for the extra money I know what I am getting with the hotel and it is in a great location.  This hotel for me is perfect for a city break in London and I would recommend it.",5,2016,12,01
120,Service on another level!,I recently stayed for 7 days at the Hilton London Bankside. The service is on another level. Everybody is very welcoming. Unbelievably comfortable beds! Thank you Per and HJ for taking such a good care of me...,5,2016,11,30
120,Great Hotel ,"We stayed at The Hilton Bankside after attending a concert at The O2. We booked a King Junior Suite, which was absolutely fantastic.

On arrival we went for drinks in the bar, it's a Gin lovers paradise with an amazing selection. We were served by the Manager who did a great job, I loved the olives they served!

The bed was mega comfortable and we loved the bathroom. 

Breakfast was really nice and the staff were all so pleasant and attentive.

All in all, a great experience and highly recommended!",5,2016,11,29
120,Fabulous Hotel,"Hotel is modern, clean and very central. Beds were incredibly comfortable. Only disappointment was our window looked out onto a brick wall and felt room service was a little too pricey.  Apart from that the rest of the stay was fantastic.",5,2016,11,29
120,Impressive!,"Visited this hotel over the weekend for a Thanksgiving Dinner and can say that I was very impressed. The staff at the Front desk were very friendly and professional and the lobby area was tastefully decorated. The bedroom was spacious, very clean and layout very good and the bathroom was big as well with more than enough toiletries! The towels were fluffy and large and the shower powerful.  They had a very good breakfast spread and the waiters and waitresses smiled whilst clearing tables etc. I would stay here again and recommend the hotel to friends and family!",5,2016,11,28
120,"great hotel, great service!","as a diamond member, I asked for a suite upgrade and got one (although had to wait until 2pm to get the room). they delivered local apples as welcome gift, and the non-alcohol drinks/snacks in the minibar were free. 
as we went out dinner, they prepared the bed for us, with towel and slippers set by the bed. 
had a drink at the executive lounge, food was typical lounge food, but they are very attentive.",5,2016,11,28
120,Birthday Celebration,"Fantastic location, quality and service. Staff really attentive in making this a perfect weekend break for my family.  The executive lounge was an absolute boon for pre dinner drinks. Dined at the iconic Oxo Tower although the Oxbo restaurant looked very inviting... breakfast was busy yet still very good; I would prefer teapots rather than a bag on a string! Tate Modern is across the road with the Shard, Globe Theatre, Southbank and Borough Market all a short riverside walk away. Would definitely go back.",5,2016,11,28
120,Great hotel and location,Stayed at Bankside Hilton for 5 nights for business in July. Great location with easy walk across river to St Paul's. Staff was great. Restaurant was very good for breakfast and also for dinner. Executive lounge had great selection in the evenings. Modern spacious rooms on executive floor. Will stay there again on my next visit in January.,5,2016,11,27
120,Bee hives on the roof,"I'm a regular stayer in Southwark, had opportunity to stay at The Hilton when it came within company price range. 

Very well appointed rooms. Quiet. I would prefer a bath to a shower, but it was walk in and powerful. 

Breakfast excellent. Plenty of choice. 

Walking from the room, on 4th floor, towards lifts, large windows open out onto a grassed roof with beehives. 

No hesitation in going back, assuming price remains in range. ",4,2016,11,27
120,super new Hilton !,"We selected this Hilton as we wanted to visit the Tate Modern on Sunday morning after spending an evening at Sadlers Wells.  The location is perfect for the Tate and access to the river and just across from St Paul's.  A new build in a modern version of the local vernacular it is a 'stand out' hotel.

Super friendly service we were already check in via the app and just needed the room cards. very comfy bed, lovely bathroom, overall a great room, nap views on 1st floor but you cannot have everything.

Bar and restaurant  great service, food is very good not great but would definitely se them again.  Dinner service was good, smoked salmon, beetroot, fish starters any delicious, pork, lamb cutlets, fish main were lovely dishes.

A buffet breakfast, was ideal and had all the ingredients of a super well sock buffet, fro fruit yoghurt to 'full English' pancakes waffles and more.

Plan on returning next year.",5,2016,11,27
120,staff makes this place extra special,This is a lovely new hotel in a trendy area with a cozy bar/restaurant and spacious rooms. But the services here set this hotel apart. The staff was so helpful with everything from early check-in to assisting in a minor medical emergency. Bonus points go to the surprisingly large pool in the basement.,5,2016,11,26
120,Fantastic for an American away Thanksgiving week!!,"An amazing staff!! Very courteous and helpful. I forgot my converter and they sent one up. After a an amazing work week away from home, I arrived in the evening Thanksgiving night with a pecan bar surprise. Very thoughtful touch!!!",5,2016,11,26
120,Poor reception,"Checked in to pre booked hotel room. Receptionist demanded £50 as it was hotel policy. Room paid for by my company. She insisted it was in case I used the bar or room service. In view of her attitude I would go anywhere other than the bar or restaurant here. 

Then demanded my home address. I asked why, as booking paid for by my company. She asserted it was UK legislation that required it. This became interesting. I explained I was a lawyer and asked what UK legislation require my home address for a stay at a hotel paid for by my company. Off she went returning with a ""manager"" who told me it was the Human Rights Act. I asked which section.  He couldn't tell me, as there is no requirement under HRA legislation. Then he said it was in case the hotel needed to contact me. When I asked what for, his response was for ""special offers"". So Hilton Hotels claim Human Rights Act gives them the right to demand my personal data for marketing purposes. 

Nice hotel. But so are many others locally. What makes a hotel is the people who work there and this fails miserably.",1,2016,11,24
120,Great lunch ,"Went with family for a peaceful and enjoyable meal and we got it!!!! 
Loved everything, buffet is gorgeous, food outstanding, service also great , Matteo the manager does a very good job and the staff too, keep it up!!! We will go back soon 
",5,2016,11,23
120,My best Hilton so far,Stayed here for 2 nights on business. Nice modern rooms with comfy beds. Air con is not noisy!! Staff were super efficient from check in through to finding taxi the next day. Did not eat here so can't comment on the food ...,4,2016,11,23
120,Great Place To Stay ,"We found the Hilton to be in a great location, just the other side of the river from central London. The staff throughout our stay were all very helpful and the room decor was very modern with plenty of space. Overall the hotel is in a great location, easy to find and perfect for a quite nights sleep. ",5,2016,11,21
120,Excellent London Birthday visit!,This is definitely one of the best hotels I've stayed in. Staff are so friendly and I was surprised that they'd remembered me personally  the following morning despite having so many guest there - was a lovely touch. Would recommend and would definitely stay again. ,5,2016,11,21
120,The BEST hotel in London!,"We have visited many hotels in London, from the Savoy to a Premier Hub and I can honestly say this is, by far, the best experience we've had.
Most of the other hotels could learn a lot from the excellent staff. They were all extremely welcoming, professional and 'smiley'.
The check-in was easy and quick, the room was lovely with much thought over the design. 
The bar area was great for a few cocktails, the staff superb and attentive and prices reasonable for a central city hotel.
There was an incredible choice of yummy food for breakfast, everything was of the highest standard and again the staff were marvellous.
I could not recommend this hotel and staff highly enough, we will return and hope it continues to blossom.
Well done, a great effort! Thank you 😊.
",5,2016,11,20
120,Great stay,"The interior of the hotel is modern and smart. It certainly looks like it's had a recent refurbishment. 

The staff were, without exception, friendly and professional.

The room was great with lovely soft pillows and a cosy duvet. The huge shower was fab. The room was a bit hot though and I'd like to see a large mirror above the desk.

We really enjoyed the pool (much bigger than expected and the perfect temperature) and jacuzzi.

Breakfast was tasty and extensive (although no baked beans) and we enjoyed a drink in the bar.",5,2016,11,20
120,"Quiet, low-key luxury","I’ve stayed at the Hilton London Bankside at least 6 or 7 times since its opening. I keep coming back because of the quality of service, value, and rooms.

The staff is incredibly helpful, but unobtrusive. They do little things like press the elevator button, when they see you are heading to the lifts, and offer umbrellas when there’s a chance of rain. I always get a newspaper delivered to my room in the morning. There’s daily maid service and evening turn-down, and the hotel is very clean.

The property is well maintained with beautiful floral arrangements in the lobby, and low key, modern/ boutique design in the rooms, which include excellent showers, comfortable beds, and stocked mini-fridges. I’ve stayed in different parts of the building and it’s always been quiet. They have excellent blackout curtains and very consistent internet. 

Pros
Very close to Jubilee, District & Circle lines, as well as many buses and the Tate Modern
Fitness center and pool
Strong internet, comfortable bed, great showers
They also take care to ""surprise and delight"" Hilton Honors guests during their stay

Cons
Location is very quiet on the weekend, but the hotel restaurant and nearby Tesco, Sainsbury's, Pret are great for quick bites.
Location could actually be a plus for visitors who want to be away from central London crowds, but want to be very centrally located. 

I’m a frequent guest because my work is nearby, but I’ve also chosen to stay here on my own dime when visiting London for pleasure.",5,2016,11,18
120,B&B for a business Trip,"OK so the business trip was a major event in the Ballroom in the basement :-)   Hotel staff first class (not so the event staff)  the rooms are a very good standard clean, quality furnishings etc.  with all the little things that mark out a Luxury hotel from the ordinary. Plenty of good , and good size, towels! Dressing gowns etc  The Food at the evening event (which I assume came from the Hotels kitchens) was good. Well cooked and well presented. Breakfast also to a high quality and an attentive team to look after you. The scrambled egg was in a pan but a chef on hand to do any other version of egg you want.  It is the level of Service that sets a hotel like this apart.",4,2016,11,18
120,Good location and quality hotel,"This is a top quality hotel within a short walk of a number of London tourist attractions. The globe theatre, St. Paul's, the Shard, the Tate modern are all within ten minutes walk. Also locally are a number of coffee shops and restaurants. The hotel itself has modern decor in the entrance and in the rooms you have modern quality furniture in the bedroom and shower room. All in all very good. I did think however that the price for one night of £220 without breakfast was a bit pricey. ",5,2016,11,18
120,Hilton Always Delivers!,"Great night, staff were amazingly good to us and helped me celebrate proposing to my partner. 
Thank you so much for your hospitality. 
Stayed for one night in the executive room, the staff organised a cake for us to celebrate and the bed was incredibly comfortable.",5,2016,11,17
120,Almost perfect,"We stayed for one night, and I was really impressed. The staff were so professional, polite and happy to help. The decor was perfectly stylish and the rooms were spotlessly clean.

The bed was so comfortable we had such a great nights sleep.

I could of easily sat in the bar area and enjoyed a few drinks as the setting and ambiance were perfect. However we spent most of our stay at a wedding outside of the hotel so we didn't make use of the hotels facilities to the full. 

The only slight annoyances were, the water wasn't particularly hot. No mirror in the bedroom only in bathroom. The bathroom had a European plug socket so depending on the room you stay in, drying your hair may be a bit of an issue unless you bring an adapter.

Finally only one cup left in the room for hot drinks despite 2 people staying in the room and no coffee sachets.

Despite these slight annoyances I wouldn't hesitate in booking to stay here again! Amazing hotel and amazing staff ",4,2016,11,15
120,Exellent!,"I have spent a weekend with my famiy in this new propety. Rooms are amazing, comfortable and nice, food in lounge was very nice and breakfast selection just amazing!!! Very polite and helpfull staff and my 3,5 yo daugter loved the animals decoration and the spooky Halloween display! Walking distance from Tate modern but away from the busy streets. Cannot wait to come again! ",5,2016,11,15
120,Not as good as last year,"I stayed here last year after the Hotel had just opened and the service and attention to detail was second to none. However the same could not be said for my last stay 6th to10th November. My room was not ready on arrival so we decided to go into the bar for a late lunch, after waiting for ten min for someone to take our order I had to go upto the bar and asked to be served. The same problem also happened in the restaurant at breakfast time, in the end we had to ask for coffee rather than being asked first . One of the evenings I went to reception to ask a question and there was no one on reception for around five min, which really is not acceptable. Concierge was not much better, forgetting to book cabs which were booked the previous evening. Also be warned they don't book mini cabs, unlike last year, they now hail black cabs which are more expensive.
Talking of expensive the prices in the bar have certainly been increased compared to last year.  To me its all about the experience as much as the surroundings, whilst the rooms are undoubtedly lovely the service in my opinion has gone downhill. One other issue we faced was that myself and several colleagues staying at the hotel in different rooms each had what we can only describe as fruit flies in our rooms.  Not once but on several occasions. On the last day we even had one fly past in the dining room.",3,2016,11,14
120,Almost perfect,"+ : Amazing bed (size and comfort) ; beautiful bathroom; people were lovely

- : The room was not like the photograph we saw when we booked ; the breakfast we had in our room was expensive for a low quantity and quality ",5,2016,11,14
120,Wow.,"Title says it all, what a fantastic hotel.
Staff were some of the best I've met at a hotel, always smiling, genuinely happy to help.
We were nervous as we taking our one year old but the staff helped us with bags and were always there if needed.
If you book here, be sure to book the afternoon tea, the food was fantastic and drinks were included also.
The hotel itself was extremely clean, very central and close to the Tate museum which was the reason for our visit.
I don't think I would think twice about booking anywhere else next time I am in London.",5,2016,11,14
120,First Class Stay,"Stayed two nights on a business trip, the staff are really genuinely  friendly and helpful. The rooms are gorgeous, everything you could want, tooth brushes, slippers, bathrobes, bottles of water, full mini bar, white crisp cotton bed linen,  a turndown service. I have room service one night, sea bass with steamed rice which tasted wonderful. 
The buffet breakfast was very extensive, fresh breads and a selection of hot and cold food. The only thing was the coffee was from machines with little flavour. A set lunch for 100 people and was excellent, a selection of starters, main and desserts was served to the table which catered for every taste.",5,2016,11,13
120,Comfort and style at a reasonable price,"I stayed at Hilton Bankside for a weekend with work, and I really enjoyed it.

We were booked into large twin guest rooms which was more than sufficient. Comfortable beds, large showers, stylish interior. There was a big desk/work station, as well as a large tv. The rooms also feature complimentary drinks, bathrobes and slippers. Very quiet and clean.

Our meeting room downstairs was large, and well equipped. Comfortable chairs and good technical solutions enabled us to work efficiently. Good coffee dock in the hallway.

The breakfast buffet was very good, and I liked that you could get eggs and omelets made to order. The hotel bar, The Destillery, was also comfortable with a good selection of drinks. I recommend the GT with homemade tonic water. Music was, at times, a bit loud for a quiet coffee, but not too bad.

We were greeted by Hannah upon arrival, and her and the rest of the staff were very attentive and effective throughout the stay. 

All in all, our group had an excellent experience. The hotel is very stylish, and design has not compromised functionality. Would stay again.",5,2016,11,13
120,Nice hotel ,I stayed here on business for 5 nights recently. It is a newer hotel located a mile east of London Eye. Staff were very nice and accommodating during my stay. Was having issues with America vs UK electrical plug that they helped me with. Fitness center was nice and secluded. Ate at restaurant for dinner 3 of the nights. Ribeye steak was very good. Quick walk to the river to board water taxi to head to Excel. Overall a very pleasant stay. Would do again. ,5,2016,11,13
120,Nice hotel,"Really nice hotel very warm welcome rooms very nice and food good would highly recommend, good location worth the money not cheap but you do get what you pay for and the breakfast was very good and a vast choice ",5,2016,11,13
120,Best Hilton Hotel I have ever stayed at ever,"Relatively new hotel as it has been open for over a year from what staff told me.  It was obvious as the hotel room, furniture, tv, and bathroom were all new and clean.  The staff were super nice and accommodating.  Located near the Shakespeare Globe Theatre.  Lots of restaurants nearby, many that we missed until the last few days of our visit.  3 convenience stores close by.  Since we had a fridge, we bought drinks and perishables from the local stores and put them in the fridge.  Took them with us everyday that we went out on the daily London trips.  Has a business center with 2 computer terminals and printers between the front desk and the breakfast area.  The breakfasts that were served were excellent in quality and quantity.  Used my benefits as a Gold Member to take advantage of the breakfasts daily.  The hotel was about a 5-10 minute walk away from the Southwalk Underground Station (in the U.S., we call it the subway), and close to the Waterloo station as well.  Out of all of the hotels I have stayed in the US, Canada, and England, this is the best hotel I have ever stayed at.  The only downside is that since my wife picked the place instead of me, she is constantly reminding me that she does a better job picking hotels than me.  Small price to pay for the high quality hotel we stayed at.  Overall I love London, and the Hilton London Bankside was part of the reason.  When I do visit London again, I will definitely pick this place again for the location, quality of the hotel, and the pleasant staff.",5,2016,11,13
120,Affordable luxury in the heart of the city,"What a treat! Luxurious from the minute you walk in. Staff helpful and professional. Rooms amazing! Beds really comfy, and the shower superb. Breakfast in the restaurant next morning was delicious from the help yourself buffet - you could certainly stock up for the day, lol.(Not sure about the taxidermy animals heads all around, though)
Only stayed one night, so sadly didn't get to use the pool etc. Will try next time!",4,2016,11,12
120,Excellent property and staff.  Only disappointment was room service food.,"This is a quite new property and is in excellent condition.  As with previous stays, staff are equal to the best Hiltons in UK. Rooms are excellent.  Only disappointment was room service food.  Chips cold and dried up, plus steak difficult to cut.",5,2016,11,12
120,The England Experience,I ABSOLUTELY LOVE IT HERE! No doubt I my mind if I were to return to England this would be my recommendation. They did an amazing job making sure my vacation was worth the cost! Money well spent! Visit,5,2016,11,11
120,"excellent, modern, well-situated Hilton","One of the newest Hiltons...so designed superbly with attractive features and excellent, hi-spec rooms. Very comfortable, with highly trained and attentive staff. was at a corporate function here also, where the food (considering was for 500) was top-class. Next morning's breakfast also excellent, in a superbly-deisgned retsaurant area. A real pleasure, and London very accessible from here.",5,2016,11,11
120,Good modern Hilton,"Good location close to London Bridge.
Hotel is modern, room not too big but well maintained and WiFi is reliable. The executive lounge is excellent and offers great variety of food at breakfast and drinks and snacks during the evening. Staff is very professional.",5,2016,11,08
120,5 Star Penthouse,"We had never stayed in a Penthouse so decided to treat ourselves and what a treat it was.  We arrived at the hotel early to drop off our cases but were surprised to find the room was ready so we were able to move in immediately and enjoy breakfast in the Executive room.  The Penthouse suite is just incredible.  The attention to detail is exceptional.  

The bathroom is all marble with a free standing bath in the middle.  Huge walk in shower and his & her sinks.  All beautiful.

The bedroom has a king size bed and lovely soft pillows.  The room also has floor to ceiling windows, a very pretty couch and coffee table, TV and also mood lighting.  

The lounge area has a beautiful wooden floor, kitchen area with dining table, a large TV which can be enclosed behind the zebra man doors, and also enjoys floor to ceiling windows.  There's also a large terrace with plenty of seating and you can just see the top of the Shard from the terrace.  

The staff in this hotel are also very attentive and wherever we went everyone was so friendly and helpful.  We also dined in the restaurant and enjoyed a beautiful meal.  All in all this hotel is exceptional and we can't wait to go back.",5,2016,11,07
120,Perfect in every way,"I stayed in this hotel for one night. Must say that this hotel is perfect in every way, such stylish rooms and impeccable service. The style is minimalistic and sleek, almost like an artwork as a whole. Bed was very comfortable and room was very spacious. Gym and pool were really nice touch in the morning. Breakfast was excellent, I loved it.",4,2016,11,07
120,Excellent experience ,"A weekend visit and would not hesitate to return. Hotel is 5min walk from Southwark tube station (Jubilee line) book in was fast, friendly and efficient. We had booked direct with the hotel website. Rooms were modern, spotlessly clean and well appointed. Good bath/ shower facilities, bed very comfy and no noise! A great sleep! Breakfast plentiful and to a high standard with attentive pleasant staff. ",5,2016,11,06
120,Surprisingly good experience!,"I have been staying in many hotels in London during the last years. This time, we have chosen the Hilton Bankside for a weekend stay due to the approximate to the Tate Modern, which is basically just 3 minutes away. I was pleasantly surprised by the Hilton, new and fresh hotel, very attentive service and well appointed rooms with comfy beds.
Very quite, no noise from the street which is unusual for London as well.
This hotel will remain on my shortlist, when traveling to London next time.",5,2016,11,06
120,Can't fault it ,"Really modern and trendy Hilton hotel, great comfy beds, modern bathroom with built in speaker.. Can't fault the place! The staff were extremely lovely and the location was great.. Right next to tate modern. Do try they're bottomless brunch at the Oxbo, fun tipsy experience. ",5,2016,11,06
120,perfection,"The perfect hotel if you plan a trip to london , clean ,comfortable, easy acces to all major tourist spots, breakfast was perfect ,choise ,taste, helpfullnes off people ,.... ,but wat makes this hotel perfect is how you ae made feel welcome and at home by every member off its staff, from cleaning lady to manager , so i truly reccomend this place",5,2016,11,06
120,Pretty good,"We stayed here as a group of 4 in two junior suites for a weekend, and had a good time.  The building has a very modern feel to it, with lots of wood colours etc.  All the junior suites appear to be in the same position on each floor, so we had rooms above one another.  The room was very large (for London) and had a superking bed, spacious seating area and large bathroom. See photos for a better idea. The minibar was complimentary and restocked daily; it was well supplied with snacks and drinks and this was a very pleasant surprise. 

We had lounge access with our room; it was probably the best looking Hilton lounge I've seen anywhere in the world (see photos), and the afternoon tea / evening drinks and canapes were reasonably good - although they did run out of some drinks. Breakfast was ok but some of the cooked offering was cold and we had to ask for a fresh supply to be brought out.

The staff were polite and tried to be helpful, but didn't seem as polished as in other London Hiltons. It took about 15 minutes to check-in, and other interactions were similarly long. I suspect the staff are fairly new and perhaps need another few months to settle into their roles before the service matches that of equivalent properties.

The location is great, just a few minutes walk from Southwark Underground and almost literally next door to Tate Modern.  I'd go back to this Hilton, and would probably book a room with lounge access on a future visit too.",4,2016,11,06
120,Rooms were superb but the restaurant & housekeeping lets it down,"We stayed overnight to attend an event.  The actual room was 5 star.  Fab.  While there the maid cleaned up the bathroom so end up throwing some personal items away which I had left on the vanity.  I felt this was an invasion of privacy.  if I wanted to throw the items away I would have. I did complain and was promised that the manageress would look into this.  I have not heard anything from the hotel since.

there was no service in the restaurant at breakfast time.  We were shown to a table and then left to fend for ourselves.  nothing was explained whatsoever.

Prior to the event we visited the bar for a drink.  the hotel had run out of white wine!

The hotel is not cheap.  the service in the hotel does not match the ambiance of the rooms.  There is a Premier Inn a 30 second walk from the hotel.  if in the area again I would stay there and save the moneh.",4,2016,11,05
120,luxury escape,"Thank you to this fantastic hotel for providing us with a much needed break. We relaxed as soon as we walked into the hotel by the gorgeous smell of sandalwood, and the festive Halloween display. We were greeted by very friendly, accommodating staff. We had the BEST night sleep in THE most comfortable bed we've ever stayed in!!",5,2016,11,04
120,Would gladly stay here again,"This is a fantastic hotel. Modern and spacious rooms. Really liked the pull out drawer fridge - need to get one for my house.

The bed was ridiculously comfortable - easily the best hotel bed I have slept in.

Not the best location for tourists but central enough to see the sights and pretty quiet.",5,2016,11,04
120,The best Hilton i ever stayed at!,"As a Gold HHonors member, I’ve stayed at many Hilton properties but I can honestly say this Hilton is the best Hilton that I’ve ever stayed at. Bellman greeted me outside the hotel and assisted me with my luggage. My check-in with Hannah at reception was superb! It was a perfect check-in. Hannah greeted me with a welcoming smile; she acknowledged my HHonors status and thanked me for my loyalty and choosing to stay at the property. She then went on introducing me to all the food & beverage options, breakfast and the gym & pool facilities in the hotel and their hours of operation. She also gave me directions to the gym and the pool. My room was clean, crisp & modern. The bed was probably the most comfortable bed I have ever slept on. Maybe it’s because it’s a new hotel and everything is still fluffy but I must day the sheets and duvet was so soft and inviting. I am seriously considering buying the sheets and duvets for my own bed. Breakfast was wonderful excellent every morning. Everyone in the restaurant greeted me in the morning and offered me coffee as soon as I sat down.  John at the concierge desk was friendly and recommended some great restaurants and assisted us with reservations. Overall there is just this warm sense of hospitality that I never have received in any other Hiltons around the world. I certainly will return again and will recommend this wonderful hotel to all my friends and family. Also the hotel is located near 2 supermarkets.  5 minute walk to the Southwark tube station, Tate Modern and Millennium Bridge. Borough Market is about 15 minute walk.",5,2016,11,03
120,"Superb Service, outstanding staff","From the moment you walk through the door it is noticable the training of the hotel staff is the finest. So professional throughout the stay and from all staff, it was very enjoyable and i had a business partner with me who also agreed. The hotel is impecable and the exec lounge was extremely nice. An absolute pleasure staying here!",5,2016,11,03
120,Add this to my list of favorite hotels in London.,"This hotel is fairly new and so not surprising still in great condition. Stayed 4 nights in room 221 which was extremely quiet even though we could see an elevated train regularly passing by a block away. Lobby is tiny and quite busy and noisy in the evenings because of the bar but didn't hear anything in our room. Difficult to converse at checkin because of the noise, Would have preferred a tub and shower but the shower is generously proportioned with several shower heads, rain among them. Complimentary waters, Coke, and juice in the minibar. Loved the quirky little wolf head sculpture on the wall. Chose this hotel from careful study of the reviews. View from our room was of streets, flats, and the elevated train. Looked as though the view from some rooms may be of a bleak interior courtyard so probably best to ask for a room that faces outward. Hotel only seven stories so probably not any rooms with lovely views across the river. Effective blackout curtains. Nice television (although no CNN) and lots of outlets in every part of the room. Indoor pool in basement. Very strong smell of chlorine (they really should install salt water pools in these underground facilities) in the pool room and quite, even unpleasantly steamy (pool in the One Aldwych hotel far superior). No one in the pool room when we visited. Asked attendant about sauna or steam and told those were coming in the future. So, if you want a modern, new, posh, quiet room in this part of London and not bothered about a lovely view or pool, the Bankside does the job.",5,2016,11,03
120,One of the best hotels in London,"I've stayed for years in London but this hotel is a different pedigree to most, the service is fantastic, the rooms are super comfortable and quite pleasant. It's a like a home away from home for me! Top tip, for those on business get access to the executive lounge, again a really comfortable and quiet place to work with unlimited access to food, water, coffee etc. Beats sitting in Starbucks in the city with all the noise before a meeting. Highly recommend.",5,2016,11,03
120,"""Excellent Stay""","We stayed at this hotel while visiting our son in London and would definitely recommend it. The hotel staff were very friendly and helpful and were happy to look after our luggage until check in time so that we didn't have to take it around London with us. The hotel was very clean and tastefully decorated. The room was spacious, the bathroom had  a brilliant walk in shower and  the bed was very comfortable. The selection for breakfast was amazing, so many choices. We always try to stay in Hilton Hotels, both in England and abroad and this is definitely one of the best Hilton's we have stayed in. We would definitely recommend it and will be back when we are next in London. Thank you.",5,2016,11,01
120,Another amazing stay,"Each time we come here it really does just get better - this is now my home from home whenever I need to stay in London. Why because the service is impeccable, the staff so friendly and welcoming and the rooms so comfortable.

One of the few hotels in London to have a pool and if you are staying here during the weekend be sure to try the Saturday Brunch and/or Sunday Lunch at the sublime OxBo.

Cannot wait to return - thanks as always team Bankside! ",5,2016,10,31
120,Stay by default,"We were redirected and transported to this location when the Hilton Islington gave away our room despite our having checked in on line and advised the hotel of a late flight arrival

This hotel,is what you would expect from a Hilton, just not the location we sought. Not their fault at all, room was great.",5,2016,10,31
120,Why stay anywhere else in London,"Wow! I've stayed in a vast array of different hotels in London but now I need look no further. I will never stay any where else again. This hotel is a gem in the minefield that is London hotels. From the beautiful building to the supremely professionial staff, this hotel ticks every box. 
The frond deskills staff are skilled and extremely courteous.  The restaurant is fantastic, the rooms are wonderfully furnished and clean. Very comfortable beds and lovely bathrooms. 
It's hard to write a review as I find myself running out of superlatives. 

This hotel is awesome.

The Hilton chain should be proud of this hotel.",5,2016,10,31
120,Quite marvellous!,"Business trip for 4 nights. Can't find a single thing to nag. Amazing bed, comfy room, spacious bathroom, excellent way-beyond-average breakfast (all breakfast buffets nowadays seem like a replica, don't they?), trendy location, excellent facilities, super speedy laundry service, quite relaxing pool, and the best so far attitude and service from every single employee i interacted. I visit London every year and choose a different hotel each time. Next year i might do an exception. Book without hesitation. Thank you for a wonderful stay.",5,2016,10,31
120,Probably the best weekend we have had in a Hotel,"From the minute we arrived our experience was outstanding we could not ask for more. The staff where polite, attentive, friendly & extremely helpful. It would be hard for them to do any better. We have stayed in a king junior suite once before. This time we booked a King deluxe junior suite. Had no idea what to expect but was amazed to find it was huge with a lounge with dinning table sofas & tv, bedroom with tv, bathroom with a bath & a walk in shower plus a room with a separate 2nd toilet. This made our 22nd wedding anniversary weekend a very enjoyable & memorable time. I would like to thank all the staff at the hotel for making our  long weekend in London for our wedding anniversary one of the best hotel experiences we have ever had. What wonderful staff you have! The use of the executive lounge & complimentry wifi is a big plus & well worth paying a little extra for. One I will look out for when staying at other Hilton hotels..",5,2016,10,31
120,Great hidden gem at a great price,"I made a last minute change to this hotel and I'm really glad I did. It's an excellent property with a great staff and amenities. The underground is a short walk away, and there a few few shops right outside to pick up and snacks and such. Only minor drawback was that the neighborhood is a bit blah and it seems to really die down on the weekend. However, so many things are a short train or cab ride away so it wasn't that much of a bother.",5,2016,10,30
120,Excellent stay in the penthouse suite,"We stayed in the penthouse suite and had friends and family stay in king exec rooms. Although the penthouse is expensive it is definitely a fantastic experience. Beautiful decor with unusual features, very spacious with roomy outside terrace with views. The executive lounge is very stylish with a good selection of complementary food and drinks. Staff very welcoming and helpful. Would definitely stay again :) ",5,2016,10,28
120,Convenient Hotel with Convivial Bar Staff,"Spent two nights here as part of a mini-vacation to London after being in Dublin for business and enjoyed my time considerably. The hotel is new and it shows (in a positive way), clean rooms, modern design, etc. I particularly enjoyed the bar and the bar staff, who were friendly and knowledgable about the drinks at the bar. Also, the room had a fridge which is always a 50-50 shot in Europe but which I really appreciate.",4,2016,10,27
120,Handy location,"Stayed here on business  and had a great stay. The location is fantastic, tucked behind the Tate Modern with great access to the south bank. The hotel is also very convenient for the City, just a short walk across the Millenium Bridge to St Pauls, which is a lovely walk in the morning. The hotel is still relatively new, so everything is immaculate. The staff are very attentive and welcoming. The bar area had a nice buzz, without being too manic or lacking atmosphere like many hotel bars. Only downside with this hotel is that it is now very popular so can be hard to book without paying premium prices.",5,2016,10,27
120,Ease of access ,"Within a 5min walk of Southwark stn and within 20 mins walk of the London eye a reasonable night sleep except for the feather down mattress protector and quilt cover the quills poke you.
Otherwise clean and helpful staff. Breakfast in the morning is of good quality but some staff are little slow overall 4/5",4,2016,10,26
120,great location,"very helpful staff and nice big rooms. A pleasant change for London. Very easy to get around town and some nice local places to eat. Of course, don't forget to go to borough market! Great food and huge choice.",4,2016,10,26
120,Very Enjoyable,"Stayed here for 2 nights recently on a leisure break in London. The Hotel is in a quiet backstreet of London just off the south bank near Tate Modern, Its about 7 min walk from Southwark Underground station and was relatively convenient. From there London is your oyster in 15 to 20 mins in any direction so that's nice! 

The lobby and reception area of the hotel are modern and very contemporary,However  I Personally found it to be under lit, As someone with partial sight I found the lobby reception and the Restaurant way to dark over all and made traversing it more challenging than i would have liked.

I was recognized as a Gold Hilton Honors Member when i arrived which i appreciated, The WiFi however with the Hilton Honors Network wouldn't work with my details and even the reception team couldn't get me logged in this way and had to give me access via a voucher ( not ideal but they made it right) 

The room was a lovely size and the king bed was like sleeping on a cloud.
The Double Size Walk in shower was the highlight though for me as im a big & tall person it was super lovely not to be crammed into one of them tiny shower cubicles..

had my room turned down on the first night which i appreciated but it wasn't done on the second night ( inconsistent) i actually would have appreciated it more the second night as id been in the west end to see a show.

Breakfast was nice though the continental aspect is better delivered than the hot food element imo.. though i did appreciate the Real Quality of the Filter Coffee Provided to me both days.

The Bar was okay the Cocktails i had were expertly executed and were delicious the food menu was nice if a bit expensive for what it was but the  Belly Pork Cubes Deep Fried and the Potted Weymouth Crab were excellent.

i would and am going to return to the hotel again in the not too distant future and if you are looking for a quieter but still easy access hotel to all of London then you could do a whole lot worse than stay here!

just wish they would make it brighter in the lobby area and restaurant is all.

Ps they spray out some scented air and its a little odd i have to say..",4,2016,10,25
120,Comfortable hotel in a good location at a fair price.,"The staff were very welcoming and friendly. The room I stayed in was very quite and looked like it had recently been refurbished. The cost was competitive for this area.
Location is good with local attractions a short walk, i.e. borough market, Cutty Sark, Tate modern, etc. I would stay here again when in London.",4,2016,10,25
120,"Good,modern, clean, and spacious but","It was too dark and windows were not so good for privacy of all guest rooms. Recommend to book more than guest room and above level 3(3rd floor).

좋은후기들처럼 시설자체는 갠찮은데, 담에 여기숙박한다면 디럭스이상해야할듯 합니다. 게스트룸은 ㅜㅜ 어딘가갇힌 느낌.
잠만 주무신다면야 뭐 시설이좋으니까요.
시내접근성도 튜브로충분하지만 걷는건 항상 강을건넌다는게 어느정도 부담스런일이라 교통을이용하게되더라구요.

120,Best Hilton in London,"This new property has made every effort to be truly outstanding. Every member of staff goes beyond duty to make you feel welcome and well served.  The facility is the most comfortable of all Hilton's we have stayed at and since I'm a Diamond member and have been for years I have stayed at many. Every aspect of the hotel from the club room, health club and excellent restaurants are absolutely first rate.  I have stayed at Hilton Bankside a number of times over the past year and each visit I received the same very high level of service. My wife and I can't recommend this facility more highly.",5,2016,10,24
120,Fantastic staff!,"Just back from a week in the Hilton Bankside.  I was there for a conference and the one 'standout' thing from my visit there was the staff.  They are so friendly and helpful without exception - everyone from the reception staff / concierge desk to the waiting staff in the bar and restaurant to the cleaning staff upstairs.  The level of service is just perfect.  I wasn't feeling well on one of the evenings and I ordered a sandwich from room service.  I mentioned to the waiter who brought it up that I wasn't feeling so well and was staying in for the night.  Half an hour later he arrived back with a lovely tea tray with Lemon & Ginger tea, peppermint tea, hot water and lemons and a little plate of biscuits.  A really thoughtful touch that was much appreciated.  

The rooms are lovely and the beds very comfortable.  Everything is spotless and very well kept.  The food in the bar is very nice as is the food you order from room service.  I would highly recommend.",5,2016,10,24
120,Wonderful hotel,"I stayed in this hotel for three nights on a business trip.

Great hotel! Rooms are very large, bed was incredibly comfortable, fridge contained free refreshments which were restocked daily.

The location was super, a few moments walk to the jubilee line.

The hotel's decor was very polished. Rooms were new and the cleaning service superb!

Plenty of shops nearby as well.

",5,2016,10,21
120,As a business hotel should be,"Already a few days after my stay, there's hardly anything that stands out when thinking about this hotel, and that's a compliment. Everything was just as it should be, decent, clean and customer friendly. The design is very modern but warm. ",5,2016,10,21
120,"Fantastic location, comfortable beds","I stayed here for 1 night while on a business trip (it was sadly booked full so I couldn't stay longer). While it's pricier than some hotels, I would stay here again, absolutely. For one, the room is large and comfortable, and has both European and US style sockets - a lifesaver if you forget your adapter or only have one for many devices (plus they provide one in the room). 

For me, though, one of the huge wins was the comfort of the bed. I have fibromyalgia, so bed comfort matters. This is the only bed in the three hotels I stayed in while in London where I slept comfortably!

The breakfast buffet had great variety and cooked-to-order eggs. The food was delicious. 

The location of the hotel was fantastic. Relatively close to the tube and water taxis. Easy walk to the Tate Modern, Millennium Bridge, Shakespeare's Globe Theatre, and St Paul's Cathedral. Lots of great restaurants and bars nearby. Easy enough to get to the Kensington area and main tourist attractions but without the price tag. 

Staff were friendly and welcoming. 

Did I mention the bed was comfortable?  A good nights sleep cannot be beat. ",5,2016,10,20
120,Business & Pleasure at a Summer Ball,"An excellent hotel! I received a friendly welcome. The room was well equipped with mini bar fridge, snacks, coffee maker, slippers. The decoration was to a high standard. The whole evening went so well. The breakfast was perfect for the morning after. The hotel is in an excellent location. Close to the Tate Modern and the Thames.
I would definitely return! ",5,2016,10,20
120,Great but not quite a 5-Star Hotel,"I've just traveled for the last couple months ago, staying at 5-star hotels like Fairmont Peace Hotel in Shanghai and Conrad New York in Manhattan and all I have to say the Hilton London Bankside is... not on par. I think it barely earns its 5th star. 

My trip was a short 3-night layover trip to visit London before flying off to Iceland. When my friend and I first arrived, we were quickly helped with our bags by the Bell Desk, and then by a Front Desk person but our interaction was a prolonged PAIN. The well-mannered receptionist wasn't able to honor my room selection that I've made through the Hilton app (which is a benefit  that Hilton sells all the time) because I added an extra night to my stay. (THIS IS A FIRST.) What's even worse is that my extra night was booked as a Deluxe room. She wouldn't upgraded my room and instead downgraded and stuck my friend and I in a somewhat half-baked room. Feels great to be a Hilton Honors Blue member. 

We were in Room 111. On the smaller end of a luxury double beds room facing a brick wall. Fantastic. It has the common 5-star amenities - Peter Thomas Roth products, kettle with coffee & tea selection, robes & slippers, complimentary water, etc. Here are its weakest - hair dryer that CANNOT plugged into the outlet in BATHROOM. (ANOTHER FIRST.) There's no mirror that is close to an outlet. When I called Guest Services, they acknowledged that the hair dryer doesn't work in bathroom and offered to bring a free standing mirror. Thank you, but no thank you. There is no USB charging outlets (😂, Fairmont Peace has these and they're an older hotel while this new one doesn't.) The window track lights does NOT turn off unless you turn off all the lights. If you turn off all the lights, you CANNOT turn on the bathroom light which makes moving around even more complicated and dangerous. I had called Guest Services to ask for assistance with the lights and a hotel staff was sent to our hotel and he was stumped on how to selectively turn off certain lights. He apologies for not being about to help more and left after 10 minutes of troubleshooting. On our last night, we returned to our room from the Harry Potter  play and discovered that they've fixed the light issue in the bathroom. Their one and only attempt to make things right for our stay. Thank you for that!

Like I've stated at the beginning, Hilton London Bankside is great but not a 5-Star hotel (yet). Despite the negative aspects, they are trying to stand out in a city of superb luxury hotels. They understand that their guests would like to be left alone unless told otherwise. That their guests like to come back to a peaceful, clean & well-kept room with a maybe a thoughtful touch done to the room (water by the bedside). However, they have not gone the extra mile to earn their 5th star. Once they do, it will be a game-changer for the hotel.

120,"Modern, clean, friendly and great staff",The hotel is in a great location. It has a beautiful lobby and comfortable quiet rooms. A highlight is the friendly and professional staff nothing is too much trouble. Well located excellent all round.,5,2016,10,19
120,Excellent Hotel,"Firstly the location is good, just behind the Tate Modern; just 5 mins walk from Blackfriars which serves Gatwick airport, just cross the Millennium Bridge into the city, and 5 minutes to Southwark underground with the useful Jubilee line, and close to many attractions Globe Theatre and borough market etc.
The staff are extremely professional and friendly; the rooms are new and spotlessly clean, famous Hilton beds and pillows, free wifi, large flatscreen TV, and it has a good, inexpensive restaurant, lively bar and an executive lounge. Prices are generally lower than the other centrally located Hilton hotels such as the Conrad (which is also excellent), Park Lane, and Aldwych, and hope it stays that way!",5,2016,10,19
120,Great hotel! Fantastic location!,"Reception were warm and welcoming and our bags were taken to our room for us. Beautiful rooms and bathrooms and the beds were super comfy!

We only stayed 2 nights and would have stayed longer but the hotel was fully booked.",5,2016,10,19
120,Wonderful surprise ,"I've stayed in a few different hotels in London but this is my first Hilton experience. We received a free upgrade on our room as it was our first stay and then paid an additional £35 when checking in to upgrade on top of that to Executive... my God it was worth it! Just that small upgrade price covered afternoon tea, drinks and canapés in the evening, breakfast, plus soft drinks and snacks in our room! We saved Huge amounts of money because we were too full from afternoon tea and the evening food and drinks to need to dine out! 
My now fiancé proposed to me that morning so it was an extra special stay for us and the hotel accommodated that gracefully. Thank you for a wonderful stay, we will happily use this chain again! ",5,2016,10,18
120,Beautiful and modern!,"This place offers everything that you can expect from a five star hotel: friendly and professional employees (also French speaking), modern design, spacious rooms with comfortable beds, free beverages (water, tea and coffee). One negative point: lack of fresh air in the rooms because the windows cannot be opened. 

The hotel has also a nice pool with jacuzzi which is perfect for relaxing during the evening.

The breakfast was good (fresh orange juice, excellent choice of breads ) but could be better (vegetables were not very fresh, canned mushrooms...). 

The hotel is also well located : you need 20 minutes to go to Oxford street or to St Pancras, and only 5 minutes to Tate modern. 

 ",5,2016,10,17
120,Fantastic City Break!,"This hotel provides easy access to sights like The Globe, Tate Modern, The Shard, and on and on. It's smack in the centre of a bustling area and easy to walk around and get to the Tube and West End. With an excellent restaurant and bar, modern and well appointed rooms, and very friendly staff this was a great place to stay while in London for just a few days. Being a hotelier myself, I would happily recommend this hotel to any friends or family travelling to London.",5,2016,10,17
120,Boyzlife Concert,"Recently went to see a live show with Bryan McFadden and Keith Duffey called Boyzlife. The show was in the Ballroom which was beautiful. Me and my partner went to the bar for a drink to take to our seats for the show, being the Hilton hotel we were expecting it to be a little more expensive than our usual wine and beer. Proceeding to order our drinks there were 3 members of staff behind a small bar surrounded by customers, the service was unorganised, we struggled to understand what was taking so long as we were limited to what we could order. We ordered with one member of staff who poured the drinks for us. My partner handed his card to the gentleman who then told us we would have to wait for another member of staff that who was already serving two different customers, who then told us we had to wait as he had no change, even though we were paying on card. The staff were very blunt and rude. We then noticed on our receipt we had been charged £1.57 service charge, aswell as a £7 for a  small wine and £5.20 for a bottled beer poured into a plastic cup. 
We are people that do not mind spending a little money on these things but are limited to what we spend, but to spend that money and be treated the way we were by the staff was just upsetting and frustrating.",3,2016,10,17
120,lovely welcoming,"futurist that s i like to say about it, if your are a non retro then you will love it, open space, clean, modern, with large bathroom, and that is  a +10. same for the restaurants, great variety of option, everything was delightfull.  great job",5,2016,10,16
120,Great Hotel Stay,One of the best Hilton's I have stayed at. The location is a few minutes walk to the Southwark train station and to the borough market. I just wish the Executive Lounge was located on the same floor as the Executive Floor as opposed to the Hotel Lobby.,5,2016,10,16
120,Weekend stay,"This is a very nice hotel the bedroom was very modern and clean,lovely bathroom with separate shower,the restaraunt for dinner was fabulous and we had buffet breakfast there on 2 mornings which was very tasty,if your thinking of visiting London tower or the shard the location is great.Very happy with the service from all the staff here at the Hilton great stay.",4,2016,10,16
120,Excellent location and food.,"Stayed here a few times and always happy to return. Situated in a great location. extremely friendly and helpful staff. Very comfortable rooms . Perfect area, close to good restaurants and also easy walking distance to  Millennium and Tower Bridge.",5,2016,10,13
120,Service w/ a smile and biscuits! ,"My husband and I recently spent 3 days, 2 nights at the London Hilton Bankside and we loved it. Things we loved about it include:

THE ROOM
• We received an automatic upgrade upon arrival to a king suite. 

• The room was clean, modern and spacious for European standards. 

• The bathroom was large and well stocked with toiletries for two people. This was important to us since we traveled very light. 

SERVICE/STAFF
• We arrived late (11:00 pm) the first night and ordered room service which only took 15 min to arrived. 

• Every staff member we encountered was friendly and accommodating.

FOOD
• As HH gold members, breakfast was included in our stay however I would recommend that if it is not included you should still partake. Great variety of options... pastries, made to order pancakes, waffles and omelets, traditional British fare items, and more! Everything we had was tasty.

• Room service was tasty and they got our orders correct the first time! I have dietary restrictions and my husband is just particular yet they made sure both our orders were perfect and the was we wanted. 

• The fridge in our room stayed stocked with beverages and these little shortbread biscuits (cookies) that my husband raved about. For him the was important and as such I am mentioning. 

LOCATION
• The hotel is a 5 minute walk to Blackfriers Station and a 10 minute walk to Waterloo Tube Station. We did not utilize the tube except for when leaving to head to the airport where we got on at Blackfriers Station to take a train to London Gatwick Airport. 

• We walked to most of the main tourist sites in London... Buckingham Palace, Big Ben, The London Eye, and Parliament. For sites beyond that, we purchased a bus pass for £5/pp which was an efficient and economical way to get around. 

We enjoyed our stay and would stay again! ",5,2016,10,12
120,"Excellent Hotel, great location","The Hotel is in a great location close to Tate Modern and only few minutes to the bank and beautiful millennium bridge. The staff are very friendly, breakfast is really great and you have lots of options to choose from, lovely chefs, great pool and equipped gym. The room is a bit dark but feels lovely with fantastic beds and pillows.",5,2016,10,12
120,Conference and lunch,"Attended a works conference in this smart modern hotel. The conference facilities were very good, and lunch in the restaurant was excellent. I did find the layout a little confusing and the signage not clear, but these were minor points.",4,2016,10,11
120,Great hotel,"Smart, contemporary hotel, foyer had a lovely welcoming aroma.  Efficient staff. Spacious room with large comfortable bed, plenty storage, comfy seating area.  Large bathroom with luxurious shower.  Bed turned down, with slippers and water left out each evening.  Enjoyed use of the modern stylish pool.  We had room only so can't comment on the food.  We had a nice cocktail in the Distillery Bar, thought not inexpensive.  There is a Tesco and Sainsburys practically next door.  Also Franks. cafe does a fabulous inexpensive breakfast. Nice touch to have wine glasses in the room.  Great location for Southbank, Borough Market, Tate Modern.  Short walk to Southwark tube station.  Would definitely stay here again",5,2016,10,11
120,Great Hotel,"Stayed on a Saturday night with another couple. Hotel impressive when you walk in, quick check-in and our rooms provided access to the Executive Lounge, as our rooms weren't ready our bags were held and we were given immediate access to the Executive Lounge which was nice. Rooms nicely decorated, nice bathroom with great shower (love the concrete shower base) with a lovely comfy kingsize bed with good quality bedding.

Executive Lounge again nicely decorated with great selection of drinks and snacks. We had breakfast there in the morning and nothing was too much trouble - 3 off us requested different styles of eggs all all made fresh to order without any problem. 

When we got back to our room after a great day we had complimentary fruit, the bed has been turned down with mats and slippers on each side of the bed and we both had a complimentary bottle of water on each side of the bed.

What really made this hotel however was the staff; nothing was too much trouble ALL were friendly, polite, courteous, extremely helpful and made you feel very welcome which is exactly what you want from a great hotel and in that regard this didn't disappoint. 

The only reason I didn't give this five stars are for  a couple of minor points:

It would be great if the desk in the room doubled as a dressing table and had a mirror - all girls need somewhere to sit with a mirror to get ready so this was disappointing 
The pillows were too soft for my taste (Hilton may have had others available but I didn't ask)
The hairdryer in the room just blew out out cold air on all settings. I am sure it would have been changed had I asked but I couldn't be bothered as I only have short hair that doesn't take that long to dry
 

If you want a drink in the bar it is pricey but that's the same in most big hotels. All in all a great location, lovely staff and lovely hotel - would definitely stay again.

If you stay look out for  all the 'hidden' foxes dotted around the hotel! ",4,2016,10,10
120,Faultless!,"I stay here fairly often and I have to say that from the moment I walk through the revolving doors, I start to chill out. The aromatherapy style scent that greets you starts the relaxation, and I find the smartly dressed staff are, without exception, excellent. Whoever runs this place really knows about service. Every room I've been has been good - very comfy beds, and everything just works - and it's really quiet: I've hardly ever heard noise from outside or even the corridors.

I'm not taken to excessive praise, but this place really seems to have got it right. It just works, and well. Through work I get to choose from perhaps 8 similarly priced hotels in the area - this one actually being the longest walk from work - but it's the one I go for every time.",5,2016,10,08
120,Birthday surprise for husbands 50th!,"This hotel is amazing. From the moment you arrive the service is outstanding. I had booked a King Junior Suite as a surprise for my husbands 50th birthday. I checked in using their app so on arrival we simply signed for the key for the room. The room was by far the best we have stayed in before and we have stayed in lots! The Hilton think of everything and that is reflected in the add ons in the room. (Moisturisers, nail files, toiletries, mini bar, slippers, dressing gowns, hair dryer). The wardrobe had lights that came on when opened and mirrors built inside the doors. The room had a sofa and table area as well as a workspace if needed. The view was probably the only slight disappointment as it faced inside to a internal court area however we were busy enjoying London to dwell on this. We had a meal booked in the Shard so this hotel is in a great location to access this side of London. Although we did uber there (£5 return from shard) as I had very high heels on! The following day we walked to HMS Belfast  and it was a nice leisurely 15 minute walk around Borough Market, Hays Galleria and back to the hotel. We also had executive lounge access in the hotel so we also benefitted from complimentary drinks and snacks from this area and breakfast. Would stay here again and would recommend to anyone visiting this area of London.",5,2016,10,07
120,Smart hotel - couple of problems,"A good but brief stay overnight in this hotel - room only so can't comment on breakfast or other meals.

Smart foyer.  Efficient and polite reception.  Good wide modern corridors.
Had a King room facing inwards to the open courtyard.

Very comfy bed.  Almost two much duvet.  Air con that actually works.  Nice big TV.  Lots of storage.  Smart modern en-suite with a shower.

Check out quick.

Two negatives.  First some big clumps of hair in the shower.  The shower was otherwise immaculate so it clearly had been cleaned. Perhaps housekeeping was shedding big tuffs of hair?

Secondly there was a sign saying that I was welcome to engulfed in snacks and non-alcoholic drinks from the fridge.  The fridge contained just two bottles of water.  No snacks or non-alcoholic drinks (except for the water).  Either offer what the sign says or don't have the sign.  Your choice Hilton.",4,2016,10,07
120,Excellent quality,"Classy hotel and an excellent experience from first to last. Staff on front desk were very professional and there was evident management oversight taking in a close interest in service levels. Rooms are very well finished - about the only downside being no view, other than flat internal roof. The Distillery is an excellent bar with quality drinks offering (not inexpensive though) and very attentive and well presented staff. The restaurant OXBO was first class - independent restaurant quality rather than typical ""hotel fare"".Restaurant was just as good for breakfast with a wide choice including extensive range of breads and pastries. Although this time it was for business I'd certainly come back for a private trip.",5,2016,10,07
120,Stopover after night out in London,"Its all you'd expect from a Hilton.

The room is a tastefully decorated box with just enough stuff in it to keep you interested for the 5 minutes you wait between turns in the bathroom. 

I use the quality of the shower as a gauge of quality. Therefore this was great - loads of power through the temperature range and a large wide head. Slight downside was that the bath was slightly slippery - enough to cause caution but not fear. Always good.

The bed was good if you like bundles of soft billowy duvet and pillows. It was comfortable. The ac was quiet enough although did not drop below 18c. Blackout curtains were great too. There was no street or train noise either. We had the executive double which meant King size bed.

Mini bar was a bit disappointing with only three items in it and we did not feel like calling down for a night cap.  Discovering wine glasses and a corkscrew with the kettle added a further slight but fleeting pang of disappointment of an opportunity lost. And who uses corkscrews anymore? The real milkstix for the tea or coffee was nice rather than those pesky foil topped cartons that test the nails.

We didn't have breakfast there (see other review for breakfast club) but saw that booking b and b was way cheaper than just deciding to order on demand. 

We'd go again.
",4,2016,10,07
120,Short trip to London,"A lovely hotel in London. Slightly away from the hustle and bustle of central London, and yet just a stone's throw away.

The room we were in was upgraded and was excellent value for money. It was large, with an additional bed, ideal for a family with kids. The reception was grand, the staff friendly, and yet the security was tight. Excellence defines the hotel in every way. 

The executive lounge breakfast was great, and the made-to-order omelette was as if my mom was in the kitchen. Kudos to he chef to understand exactly what the patron wants. The croissants were fresh, and the coffee, though by the machine, was very good as well.

I would like to think of issues, and can come up with nothing except that parking was an issue, just like any hotel in central London.

Overall, an excellent, unexpected surprise. This Hilton claims to be luxury, and it beats most London hotels in quality of service and attention to detail. Highly recommended! ",5,2016,10,05
120,Top notch despite minor hiccups,"As told many times before, some 600 yards from the Southwark tube station.

Very courteous staff at front desk and concierge. A new building, now about one year in age, so the premises and rooms are pristine order. Large rooms. Very comfortable beds and linen. Very good sound insulation in the rooms. For Diamond Guests, also amenities such as chocolate bars, gum bears, peanuts and soft drinks offered complimentary. And a treat from the Chef (apples, strawberries, etc. according to season waiting on the table in the evening). Turn down service also offered.

There are usually very courteous staff in the exec lounge, which - unfortunately - has very limited opening hours, not suiting the business traveler. The staff are very good to remember recurrent visitors! Sometimes drink chits are handed from the front desk to the local GIN bar, where the service is top notch.

The breakfast is adequate. Prepare to be ready to pay extra for all ""a la carte"" such as omelettes. Fried eggs and rest of the British Breakfast Cholesterol items are inclusive of. Hit and miss with coffee and orange juice, self service helps.

As for surroundings, ATM is near, as well as couple of grocery/wine stores next to the building or across the street, and very many pubs and restaurants in the near neighbourhood.

All in all - would be my choice every time if the price was right. Nowadays it seems somewhat expensive. But the competition of Hiltons in London (such as Hilton Tower Bridge, DoubleTree Tower Hill, Hilton Canary Wharf) should gradually settle that issue. Above the three mentioned in parentheses, my educated choice would every time be Hilton Bankside...",5,2016,10,05
120,"Fantastic new hotel, as Hilton's should be!!","Was really impressed with this new concept that Hilton have created. Very cool contemporary styled hotel with fabulous bar and restaurant. Te rooms are very cool, great bathrooms and very helpful staff. Location is great too and easy to access all of London via foot, Public or private travel.",5,2016,10,04
120,Outstanding,"Stayed for one night, so impressed! Really different, the rooms and lobby areas are fantastic. Excellent breakfast and free drinks on arrival. The staff, however, were amazing. Totally went out of their way to be friendly and make our stay special. Highly recommended. ",5,2016,10,04
120,Great hotel and location,Lovely hotel in a great location just off the South Bank in London.  Very convenient to Southwark tube station.  Rooms are of a very high standard and the general décor and ambience are excellent.   The reception staff were courteous and helpful.,5,2016,10,04
120,"Small(er) and Unique, Felt More Like Home","Stayed here on business for an average rate of 205GBP ($280) per night as a Diamond Hhonors member. Received an ""upgraded"" room on 3rd floor (nice big windows, small side reading room) and access to the Executive Lounge (on the ground floor). More than anything else, I think 3 things are critical to hotel stays - Location, Sleep, and Shower.

LOCATION: 5/5 This is a great location. You can hold your breath and be inside the Tate Modern, slightly farther to the Shakespeare Globe, very close to the Bankside attractions, Southwark Cathedral and Borough Market, nice easy walk across the Millenium Bridge to St. Paul's Cathedral.  A Tesco's and other grocery/ convenience stores are right nearby for snacks, as well as multiple restaurants and pubs.

GOOD SLEEP: 5/5 Great bedding, nice climate control, and the room was quiet.

SHOWER: 4/5 Really nice shower with good pressure and consistently hot. However, you have to step up probably 2 feet into the very high tub, and every day I had to completely remove the drain cover as it drained really slowly with it on.

Some other thoughts....

- This property is different from the average Hilton. It feels smaller and quaint. Even though the place was almost sold out a few nights while I was there, it almost always felt empty. The designs of the halls and rooms was also unique.
- Staff were incredibly helpful and nice. Due to my changing schedule, I ended up with multiple reservations, which they nicely combined into one final bill for me (although my HHonors points still have not posted). 
- Nice welcome letter and fruit were provided to me on arrival. This is the first hotel I have been at where the minibar was complimentary for everything except alcohol. This included Perrier, Cadbury's chocolate, nuts, gummi bears, Coca Cola, etc. Which was AWESOME and handy...but they only refilled stuff I used about every 2-3 days, and sometimes only random parts (and I maybe only had 1-2 items per evening at most).
- Tea kettle with nice selection of teas and coffee, as well as Walker's butter biscuits (again, haphazardly replaced in an inconsistent manner).
- Local newspaper delivered to my room every day.
- Every single night I was at the restaurant (3-4), they were sold-out of multiple beers on the menu. I asked about this and the waiter said they always sell out of some of them. Hmmm, I wonder how that could be fixed?
- The executive lounge is a luxurious quite hideaway with a wonderful multi-sided fireplace and large TVs. The snack selections (even at peak time) were very limited to a few cold deli items and 1-2 random other things, which I never knew what they were because they put up zero information signs about what they were (and I speak the language!). Anyhow, as far as food/ drink options, this is one is definitely below average, but the room makes up for it in tranquility.
- As a diamond, I had the nice option of taking breakfast wherever I liked. Desperate for some variety, I went to the restaurant and can report that the breakfast in the Exec Lounge is exactly the same as that in the restaurant, the only exception being that you can get an omelette from a chef in the restaurant. Just the bare basics in both places of some scrambled eggs, sausages, breads, yogurt, and fruit.  Below average breakfast for a Hilton.
- Fast Elevators.
- This property, like probably 80% of worldwide properties, has those stupid tiny little trash cans in the bathroom that you have to step on to open the lid...and they are so small that when you do that, it falls over and makes a racket or hits the wall. Why they use these $5 Ikea cans in such a high-end chain is beyond me.

Overall, really enjoyed this more than your typical Hilton stay and would gladly stay again in the future.",5,2016,10,02
120,One of the best hotels I stayed in,Hotel location is very good. The facilities are top. The room is very clean and comfortable. The staff is amazing as a world frequent traveler this is one of the best hotels I stayed in. The indoor swimming pool is a value added to this lovely hotel,5,2016,10,02
120,Overall beautiful hotel,"As you'd expect with a Hilton, the overall quality and experience was great. The staff were very friendly and helpful, and the hotel interior is beautiful and spotless, the room included.

My only small complaint was the strange lighting set up. The main switch (which also strangely seemed to turn on the lights above the window) must be on in order to turn the bathroom light on. This meant that any middle-of-the-night toilet trip by my husband woke me up to a bright light as the whole room illuminated, not just the bathroom.

Also the Edison bulb on my side of the bed was extremely flickery and emitted a high pitched humming that meant I had to try and switch it off, again having to decipher the 4 different switches next to the bed.

Other than that, extremely happy with the our stay. Beautiful, clean and central to all Southbank attractions. Perfect for our anniversary trip to London.",4,2016,10,02
120,Great business stay in London at Hilton Bankside,I could not rate this hotel any more highly. The beds are the best. The room is spotless and the bathroom luxurious. The staff are brilliant too. At the bar a chap called andy took very good care of me and throughout my stay the quality of service and level of attention was second to none. The food was top notch and you need to give this hotel a try!!,5,2016,10,01
120,"Clean, modern hotel","The London Bankside hotel was chosen due to the very convenient location close to a client's office and was a very nice hotel. Clean, friendly and updated were all positives about it. I thought there were places in the hotel that tried to be too modern, though, and left things hard to figure out. The lights had to be turned on with your room key and you couldn't have just the bathroom light on - inconvenient for others sleeping! The shower was just a room with a drain in the ground.   The only real pain point was that the complimentary wi-fi never stayed connected and i was constantly trying to reconnect, which is frustrating when on business.   Overall the hotel seems pricey for what you get, but it is a nice place to stay when in London.",4,2016,09,29
120,Amazing!!!,"Booked a suite here for a birthday, we were only meant to stay for two nights but ended up booking a third because we couldn't bare to leave! Everything was absolutely perfect, the decor, the food and in particular the staff in the bar to the right of reception. I have stayed in lots of hiltons over the years and this one is right up there! ",5,2016,09,26
120,MINI CAB RIP OFF..,"had a nice lunch with a client all good... BUT when it came to leave... ask concierge for a TAXI... but no... a [private hire ]MINI cab turns up....  charging my client £40.00 for a ride that IN A TAXI.. would only cost about £18.00 /£20.00/ saying he has to pay the hotel porter for work.... so...is this hotel letting its ""guests"" get RIPPED OFF...or is it part of the scam... wont be back... if you go...GET A REAL LONDON TAXI...your self if needed..",2,2016,09,26
120,Great Stay,"From the moment we began our stay until it was finished everything was a great experience.  My Hilton status was recognized and we were upgraded to an Executive Room.  The Executive Lounge was fantastic and the room also included daily breakfast in the hotel restaurant which was great.  The Executive Level also included other perks I have not seen elsewhere such as free Mini-Bar (with the exception of alcohol).  When we entered the hotel, we were greeted and checked in by Per Granstrom (Reception Manager) who was exceptionally helpful throughout our entire stay.  All other staff we encountered were also very polite, smiled, and always greeted you or smiled, etc as you walked by.

We did not make use of the gym, but the pool area is fantastic.  Of note to hotel management, when you select hotels with pool on hilton.com it filters out this hotel.  That may be something that you want to address.

As there is always room for improvement, I did notice a few minor maintenance issues with our room.  I did not bring it to anyone's attention as it was not worth complaining about or switching rooms.  The removable shower head was leaking and likely needs to be replaced, and there was some paint peeling in the shower as well.  I also noticed on the last day that several of the feet had come off the desk chair in the room.  None of these issues impacted our stay, but I likely should of mentioned them to the hotel so they could be addressed for the next guest.",5,2016,09,25
120,Excellent stay. Great property and staff,"This is a very nice, modern Hilton with friendly, attentive staff. Ideally located for the Southbank the rooms are great, stylish and very comfortable. Check-in was fast and staff friendly. No problems with the room which was of a very high quality. Good Hilton breakfast and then quick, hassle-free check-out. Will look forward to staying again.",5,2016,09,25
120,Fabulous overnight stay,"This was one of the nicest hotels we have stayed in. From a fabulous greeting from Anthony at reception, to the minute we left. The hotel staff were attentive, professional and happy! The pool was actually a pleasure to get into,really warm. The bed was amazingly comfortable and the food was superb. Wanted to stay another night. Highly recommend this hotel. We will definitely be back.",5,2016,09,25
120,Great business trip,I stayed here for an awards ceremony with work and it was fantastic. From arrival to departure the staff were so helpful and friendly and the hotel is impeccable.  Keep an eye out for the wolf figurines dotted around the hotel!,5,2016,09,24
120,Great place! Great management,"Went to Borough market during my week in London and this was a surprise found.

The bar is pretty cool and the waiters are willing to create any cocktail you want according with your spirit preference.

It's worth a visit",5,2016,09,24
120,Great location and terrific restaurant,"For a birthday celebration, we stayed at Bankside for two nights to make a long weekend. The Hilton Bankside is a relatively new hotel located a quiet street, so first impressions were good. It has a contemporary decor but one that is very warm and inviting.

Our allocated room was designed for guests requiring greater accessibility (wider doors, open shower etc) which didn't suit us, and might have prevented another patron taking it, so we called Reception. They sent someone up who initially insisted we needed to take the room, before relenting and offering us one a few floors up. It was a slightly unnecessary episode really; assuming the majority of the rooms are the same, and there are some free, it would have been easier to immediately offer us an alternative - we hadn't touched anything in the room and thus not incurred any cost to the hotel.

With a new room arranged, we settled in. Ours was big enough for our needs and decorated with lots of dark paneling and flooring. The bathroom in particular was well designed and useful. We first made use of the indoor pool in the lower basement. This is a wonderful space, with a pool larger than average despite being underground and it had a gym next door.

There was a large function on so the bar was busy, but it was easy enough to get a drink, before we headed into the restaurant. This was a real treat; the raspberry creme brulé was extraordinary - probably one of the best desserts I've ever had! Again, it's nicely decorated, spacious and wasn't too busy at all.

Bankside offers excellent comfort in a very good location, and was well-priced too. The room re-assignment cost it one star in my review, but otherwise it's a great place to stay in London.",4,2016,09,22
120,Anniversary surprise ,"My husband booked this hotel for our anniversary as we went to the British museum to see the Egyptian sunken cities. The staff and hotel and our room where excellent, I would definitely be back again and recommend this hotel. We have stayed in many hotels all over the world and I would give this hotel a overall rating of 10 ",5,2016,09,21
120,Hilton Bankside,"a great hotel with fantastic service, lovely rooms, fab bar and an amazing breakfast. Very modern interior which was very cosy. Good location short walk from Blackfriars station and close to Borough market, Tate modern, The Globe and more. Will stay again!",5,2016,09,18
120,"Whirlwind visit - service, service, service - great modern fragrant hotel!","Three ladies on a whirlwind birthday trip - I rang the hotel prior to arrival to inform them of my friend's special birthday visit as the hotel had been booked by an agent on our behalf - all three of us sharing the same room.
Reservations clerk explained we had access to Executive Lounge (part of the room type reserved) and that the sofa would be made up for the third person.  She then passed me onto I believe Anneka? who was absolutely brilliant.  She explained all the extras we could have including afternoon tea, pre-dinner drinks and canapes and breakfast in the morning.  She also told me she would place a card wishing our friend a happy 50th.
On arrival the first thing that hit us was the style, modern, spacious and oh so fragrant - the beautiful aroma was divine on such a hot humid London day - we immediately cooled down.
Alex on the guest services desk to the left checked me in as the reception staff were all busy with other guests.  He was fantastic, affording us every comfort and arranging some balloons to be placed in the room for Patricia.
Room was a good size (344) beautifully furnished but as three females we would have liked more light and a mirror on the desk area where we could blow dry our hair.  There are plugs situated on this excellent bureau that housed the mini bar, beverage tray and spare drawers - but no mirror other than inside the wardrobe with a plug for the hairdryer on the other side of the wall? Designed by men for business men? This did not detract from our stay in anyway - we managed and we were only here for 24 hours so it was not a deal breaker.
We arrived just before afternoon tea and visited the lounge for an extensive buffet of cakes, scones, meat and beverages. Just fantastic - the sun was shining and we asked if we could eat our tea on the terrace bar of the Distillery - the waiter told us it is not as rule allowed  - but the front desk guy (tall and blond immaculately dressed) helped us out with our crockery etc and found a lovely sofa on the terrace off the side of the hotel.
We had been given some complimentary drinks for Patricia's birthday so we indulged in the exquisite cocktails the Distillery had on offer, including Little Bird Gin (loved it) - I had one mixed with Prosecco, Ginger and Grapefruit I think - delicious.
So sated and tipsy we walked the few blocks to the Thames realising we were closer than originally thought.  The Millenium Bridge, Tate and The Globe plus the South Bank all within easy reach - 10 to 15 minutes easy stroll.
Off to a show that night so we popped into the lounge again for pre-dinner canapes and some fizz all of which was included.  Superb - the choice on offer had us going back for more so much so we didn't need dinner! The meat platter, cheeses and drinks were beautifully displayed and tasted divine.
On our return we were disappointed to find they had turned down the room but had not made up our third bed (sofa) but it was no big deal the room service staff were there within 10 minutes with duvet, pillows and sheets etc all done without fuss.  We also returned to find a lovely chocolate dessert for Pat wishing her happy birthday.
Breakfast in OxBo restaurant the next morning was again excellent, great choices of pastries, full english, continental all presented in the modern airy restaurant. 
The porters looked after our luggage whilst we popped out for some business at the nearby ITV studios and when we returned later that morning I mentioned that I thought I had left my phone charger in the room.  The porter then retrieved it within 5 minutes - amazing - we then left ready for our lunch date.
How can I sum up The Bankside - service - service and yes service.  I do belong to the Hilton Honours scheme and I have always found all Hilton hotels good but this exceeded our expectations totally.  Happy Birthday Patricia - when I'm the big 50 next year perhaps we need to go back! Thank you to everyone that made a difference to our trip - it was truly memorable for all the right reasons.",5,2016,09,18
120,Cracking place to stay. Very nice. ,"Stayed here for 2 nights and was very impressed. 

The hotel is modern and looks like it has opened quite recently, with very slick public areas - much better than most of the other hiltons I have stayed at. 

I am not sure of the price as this was a work trip, and in guessing it's quite pricey but I would definitely look to stay here again when I am next in London. 

I would also suggest booking one of the executive rooms on the 6th /7th floors they are very nice, but even better try give you access to the executive lounge which is one of the nicest lounges I have seen. Free soft drinks and nibbles all day, breakfast in the morning (selection is better in main breakfast area ) and between 6pm and 8pm there are free alcoholic drinks and canapés - very nice and can save quite a bit of cash!

The hotel is also 2 minutes from the south bank, just around the corner from the back door of the Tate Modern and a 5 minute walk from Southwark tube station making the location pretty damn good. 

Avoid driving here though valet parking only at £40 a night, public transport is much easier. ",5,2016,09,18
120,Great modern hotel! Spot on,"The hotel is extremely modern and looks fantastic, the service was great. I was there on business and could fault nothing except the truly extortionate drinks prices at the bar.
The room was well appointed with everything (Although an ironing board would have been great) of a high standard. A large comfy bed a luxurious shower and a modern TV with a decent range of channels. There was an iron & a hair dryer as well as complimentary toiletries which was all good. 
I had the breakfast which was very good.
All staff were polite and friendly at all times and felt a valued guest.",5,2016,09,17
120,Nice new hotel,"Nice hotel, I basically love anything new.

It is a business trip and I don't get time to use the pool or gym as I have early meetings and late dinners.

I like the room, square and not of a funny shape or pillar. Free beverages in the mini bar.

Only funny thing is the bed sheets made sounds like I am sleeping on plastic. Found out it is the mattress protector, I strip it away and then it was fine. Hotel probably chose something semi-water proof to protect the mattress, but trust me, very uncomfortable. The pillows made the same sounds but luckily for me, I brought my own pillow.

I forgot my toothbrush and toothpaste, asked housekeeping for a dental kit, called them again after 15 min of waiting then it arrived.

On the day I am checking out, I decided to have breakfast. I was there at 7.30am and needed to leave at 8am, I thought I was in good time but terribly wrong. Instead of taking the buffet that I thought is too much food for me, I decided to go for a standard English breakfast instead. Waited till 7.50am and asked the waitress if it's coming and if later than 7.55am, I will cancel as I need to leave. Very surprised to hear the waitress saying there is no record in the system of my order and when I pointed to the red-haired waitress to get her to check with her as she took my order. The waitress then came back and said it is in the system...anyway, it arrived 7.55am and I had to gobble up my breakfast in 5 mins.

Hence, if not for the incidents about dental kit and breakfast, I will give it a five out of five. 

Will I stay there again? Yes, if it is near to my meeting venue.",4,2016,09,16
120,Wonderful stay and impeccable customer service,"Stayed here for 3 nights on business. Big king guest room with the most heavenly beddings. Big bathroom with sufficient shelf and counter space.  Plenty of workspace with outlets for UK and US--big plus in my book. Coffeemaker, shortbread, water, juice and soda available in the room and provided free of charge. 

Entire hotel is spotless with very nice exercise and pool facilities. Food was excellent too for dinner, as well as the expansive breakfast buffet. Close to the underground and in walking distance to Borough Market, Tate Modern, Globe theatre and the harbor. 

If I have one beef, there's no outlet in the bathroom for a hair dryer.  It was a real pain to fix one's hair using the floor length mirror in the room closet.  

Check in was swift and smooth. Everyone goes out of their way to help here. From the front desk to the concierge to the porters. When the airport car I booked was running 5 minutes late, a porter approached me and volunteered to call the car driver even though I booked the car myself rather than  through the hotel. These random acts of kindness make a huge difference in setting a hotel apart from the rest. I've always been a  fan of the Hilton brand in Europe, and my stay at Hilton Bankside only strengthened my loyalty to this brand.",4,2016,09,15
120,Great hotel & staff,"Beautiful modern hotel with great amenities. My room was spacious with a king bed, sofa, desk & bureau (in which hides a mini fridge with bottled water in one ""drawer"" and a electric tea kettle with teas, coffees, mugs, glasses & a corkscrew in another ""drawer""). Good-sized closet, luggage rack, and cabinet with shelves. Hairdryer, iron & ironing board. Good-sized bathroom with lit makeup mirror and large shower. The one time I needed something from housekeeping, it arrived within a few minutes. 

Staff in the lobby, bar and breakfast area were all very professional but friendly if you chatted with them. I grabbed a sandwich & beer in the bar my first day which was very good & staff made me feel very welcome (not always the case for women traveling alone). Stopped in there for a glass of wine another evening. Bar prices seemed quite reasonable. 

Breakfast price is pretty high, but it is unlimited ""all you can eat"" with a large variety of hot & cold items. Loved the machines to make your own espresso drinks. I'd have a couple lattes with my breakfast and put a third in a ""to go"" cup as I was heading out for my day. 

I was flying out of Gatwick on my way home and staff helped me figure out the easiest way for me to get to Gatwick, taking into consideration my particular circumstances. 

On the map, the tube stop (Southwark) seemed a distance away but was only about 3 blocks. The Tate Modern is about a block away. Easy access to the eastbank & southbank areas. Millennium bridge is right by Tate and takes you to St Paul's. 
",5,2016,09,14
120,"Great hotel, okay location","Great hotel and amenities and friendly staff. Comfortable beds with very dark blackout blinds. Very quite, nice swimming pool - I would however say that it is a bit of a walk from the closet tube stops - but not a big deal.",5,2016,09,14
120,Some aspects were disappointing,"Great location and good welcome on arrival. Rooms are nicely appointed although decor a bit dark. However we found we were missing a bath towel and then the hairdryer. On each occasion the service to deliver was slow although he was a nice man. When getting back to the hotel at midnight 30 on a Saturday evening the bar was closing so only drinks in room. We had no choice but the waiter did not seem to understand a simple order of 3 drinks and very slow. No bottle opener in the room so he had to fetch one. For the price paid and the feel of the hotel these elements are poor and let the experience down badly. They also need to position a mirror for hair drying near dressing table- not having to stand by wardrobe.
The beds are super comfy and it was very quiet. A shame that these issues let down our experience badly.",3,2016,09,12
120,Excellent and quality,A truly exceptional visit! Excellent food and service that was second to none. The bed was like sleeping on a marshmallow! The staff couldn't do enough for you and the breakfast had everything you could want and more besides! ,5,2016,09,12
120,"Should be a top hotel, but some minor quibbles....","Conveniently located 5 mins walk from Tate Modern and the Globe and about 10 mins from Southwark tube station.  This is a modern hotel that is billed on the booking websites as 5-star (although to be fair we paid 4-star prices).  Large and tastefully decorated with large public areas (reception, bars, restaurant etc) and immaculate rooms. A good size for Central London, spotless, and comfortable with a huge bed, clever fridge and lots of hanging and cupboard space.  Slippers, robes and lots of towels supplied.  The attitude of the staff at reception was helpful.  

Bearing in mind that we paid about £210 per night, | would have rated it excellent (5-star) but from some quibbles.  The room was cold.  Even with the thermostat at 21C (which is a lot warmer than I would normally set it), there was a cold blast from the air conditioning outlet - the room was noticeably several degrees colder than the corridor outside.  

Food service was slow.  We ordered drinks at the bar (outstanding G&T - well done bartender) but the sandwiches we ordered took about 20 mins to arrive (this was mid afternoon and the bar was almost empty).  Similar slow food at breakfast.  This is self-service with the usual hot and cold food and a very good choice, but it took nearly 10 mins for coffee to arrive and the hot breakfast had run out of eggs (in the self service area) resulting in a huge queue for their ""cooked to order"" service.  

The big difference between a 4-star and a 3-star hotel is often the service. Slightly disappointing here.",4,2016,09,12
120,Superb hotel while in London on business,"I travel weekly to London, however this was my first stay at this hotel. Having stayed in a number of the other Hiltons, I thought this one was excellent. Rooms are large and very modern with all of the usual features you would expect. A nice touch is that the hotel provides a fridge full of complimentary soft drinks (water, coke, orange juice etc.). I was particularly impressed with the gym and spa facilities. Gym is open 24/7 which is great to accommodate those late night or early morning workouts. No sauna when I was there, however understand one is being built and due to open very soon. Location was excellent for the clients I needed to visit as short walk to Bank, Monument, Holborn etc.

Definitely planning my next trip there.",5,2016,09,12
120,Great hotels in a great location,"The hotel is very easy to reach by tube or bus. The lobby is very chic and welcoming. 
Interior is tasteful. Our room was quite roomy for a London hotel room. The bathroom too. I loved the shower.
Breakfast is a buffet with everything you could ask for.
The Tate Modern is just around the corner. I hope I can go back",4,2016,09,12
120,Fantastic hotel!,"This hotel is great! It is very clean, has great rooms and great fitness room. The is always very helpful and smiling. The location is great and just 5 minutes walk to the underground. There are many nice restaurants in the neighbourhood and Tate Modern is just 1 minute away.",5,2016,09,10
120,Another great stay. ,"I've just returned from another great stay at the Hilton Bankside and the staff are just as friendly, courteous and helpful as I remember and the beds just as comfortable. The location really is fabulous, although I would add about 5 minutes to the in room guide to local attractions, Borough Market is more like a 10-12 minute walk than the 5 minutes they predict. And the Tate Modern about 7-8 minutes (if you go there check out the viewing gallery on the 10th floor, it's free and gives you a great view of the river, St Pauls and The Shard) 

The bar continues to be a wonderful place to relax at the end of day wandering around London, I had to decline the free popcorn I was offered due to allergies so the waitress was very accommodating and found me an alternative. 

I think I've found ""my"" hotel whenever I'm in London, cant wait to come back.

120,"Great hotel, great location","Brilliant hotel! 

Beds incredibly comfy, rooms very quiet, staff were lovely and friendly, amazing location (literally walk out the hotel turn left and the Tate modern is in front of you).

Could not fault it! Will come back again. ",5,2016,09,10
120,Care about ethics and customer service? Don't stay here!!!,"Wish I read the other negative reviews before booking this hotel as I can definitely agree with other customers who experienced an additional money grab and rude staff. 

To the Hilton; customer service should not be comprised of a bunch of programmed androids spouting off the corporate policies;  completely devoid of empathy and inflexible to the point of alienating loyal customers.

I booked this hotel 6 months in advance. Read the terms carefully, stating children could stay free with adults in existing beds. Arrived after 20 hours of travel and jet lag to be told that we couldn't stay in a twin room unless we paid an additional £70 PER NIGHT!!! Why? ""Hotel Policy"".

One child can stay with 2 adults in a room with 2 twin beds, but not two kids...absolutely not logical???  They demanded that we upgrade to a King room and pay the crazy expensive upgrade fee. 

Having just landed in London, I couldn't show them where I had read these terms as I didn't have access to the internet. 

Trying to negotiate and explain to uncompromising management that kept repeating the same 'policy' over and over again, like they were reciting the corporate handbook, I knew I was completely stuck. 

We opted to leave as the Guest Relations Manager, Anneke, promised that she would arrange for a refund for my prepaid portion of our stay. Three weeks later, I still have not received a refund. I tried following up with the hotel, but now another manager, Cam, is now saying that I have to go through Expedia and is pushing me off.

Expedia paid the Hilton when I booked, it is now up to the Hilton to issue a refund. Not difficult...enter credit card number...enter amount to be refunded...press accept...done...move on!

If you think care about ethics and customer service, don't stay here!!!",1,2016,09,10
120,Wedding Anniversary,"Arrived at this hotel so the room wasn't yet ready. The staff were excellent with letting us know when the room would be sorted and taking our bags so we could head out. Upon return we headed to the room, it was great. We had been left a rather nice fruit desert/cake with ""Happy Anniversary"" on it, a real nice touch. The king size bed had the most comfortable mattress topper i have ever slept on, it was that good that within three days of being home my wife had bought one! The location is great, 5 min walk to the south bank which has a real good feel about it compared to the north of the river, more laid back. The bathroom was huge with a fabulous shower. Breakfast was also very good, it kept us going all day. Would i use this hotel again? In a heartbeat.......Thank you Hilton for a fabulous stay.",5,2016,09,07
120,Go elsewhere if HiltonHonors Gold Member ,"I booked a delux room for £400 for one night and contacted the hotel in advance, specifically asking for a king not a twin room, as my booking did not specify a bed type.

At check in I was informed no King beds were available, despite specifically asking for this.

I was however offered to PAY for an upgrade to an Executive Room. I pointed out that as a Gold card holder I am entitled to a free upgrade to the next room level (if there is availability), which clearly there was as I was just offered to pay for it! 

I was then informed by Ana, Guest Relations Manager that the Exec lounge is very busy and so my room couldn't be upgraded in a complimentary way. So an Exec room (and lounge access) was available if you paid extra, like for any customer - but not so if you wanted one as part of your HH Gold entitlement ! 

Clearly this is a hotel that pays no respect to Hilton Customer loyalty and interprets the Gold card benefits in a way that disadvantages loyal customers.

120,Good business hotel ,"Good business hotel - wifi was much better than other London Hilton's I've stayed at (Waldorf, Hilton Tower Bridge). Quite convenient if you need to be on the other side of the river. Gym can get crowded in the morning - only 3 treadmills. Nice executive lounge. Very helpful staff. ",4,2016,09,06
120,Great location on the over side of the River,"Me and my Fiancée stayed at this hotel for 1 night for my birthday. The location of the hotel with out Google map or any maps would be a bit hard to find, but with maps its a piece of cake. 

Hint:(Landmarks near- behind tate modern next to sainsburys and tesco)

Arrive:
The hotel lobby has excellent decor and very modern, All staff were friendly and said ""Hello"" and asked us if we wanted help. Checking in was quick, however we arrived at 12pm and check-in was 14:00pm. we were offered a room that was ready but had to paid £50 more, it was a bigger room and came with a complimentary mini bar.

Room (356):
Good Key card system, key card was needed to use the lift and the room. The Room was big but the window was small and over looked the street below (was advised there is a view of the Shard but couldn't see it). The room was spacious with a sofa and desk, the bathroom had a good layout with a walk in shower. When we got back to the hotel after a busy day we found that there was a turn down service which was nice(soft slippers). One thing that was odd was that there was a wolf shaped statue hanging from the wall very out of place.

Hotel amenities: 
On arrive to the Swimming Pool you get a swimming towel and a bottle of water. The entire pool is 1.2m deep and heated, Jaczzui is part of the pool but in the corner. The decor has different shades of blue and very relaxing and quite.
Didn't go to the gym but you can see it from the pool, small size but good equipment.
""Needs a steam room and sauna""

There are 2 pcs in the lobby that you can use to access the internet, however there is wifi over the whole hotel (We got complimentary wifi for 24-48hrs free of charge)

Dining: Breakfast was a standard continental breakfast lots of healthy cereals, pastries, English breakfast, juices. There were 2 chefs ready to made waffles, pancakes, eggs benedict, different eggs. Didn't have dinner but Room Service ordered Chesse and pickle sandwich the service was amazing and the night staff very friendly, however the sandwich was a bit solid on the sides and to much pickle.

Staff: All staff members were very friendly from arriving to departing. Always a Smile on there faces.

Overall It was amazing Hotel beds are very soft :D.",5,2016,09,05
120,Weekend away,"We recently stayed at the Hilton London Bankside and it restored our faith in the chain after our last couple of experiences. The staff were fantastic, and this was especially true in the executive lounge.

The restaurant on site was very good and the price was as expected.
",5,2016,09,04
120,Fantastic hotel and staff can't do enough!,"City break with my partner made special by the fabulous staff at this hotel.  Nothing is too much trouble.  Valet parking brilliant. Service second to none.  Food a tad pricey and 2 coffees at £9 in small cups a little much but all in all a great hotel and good location.  If you like to be waited on, this is the place.  All worth it with staff like this! :)

",5,2016,09,04
120,"Great hotel, wonderful location","If you have already done all the standard tourist attractions, Bankside is a great new place to explore from the Hilton. Walk to the Tate Modern, the Shakespeare Globe Theatre, London Bridge, Borough Market and the walkway along the Thames. The hotel is clean and modern. Staff is most helpful and breakfast is abundant ",5,2016,09,04
120,"Great location, great price for a Hilton brand...","I stayed at the Hilton London Bankside for 8 nights from mid-June for a holiday in London. The hotel itself is relatively new (opened late 2015) and thus is in impeccable condition. We stayed in a normal guest room and the room had all the necessary amenities and there was even a turn-down service in the evenings.

-Hotel staff were very competent, from the concierge team to the restaurant team.
-Gym and pool are sufficient for a good workout.
-I only had breakfast twice at the hotel and there was a good spread. Being vegetarian it's somewhat to tricky to indulge in the spread however the Chef (Chef Royston) went out of his way to prepare specially made meals. Much appreciated!
-With regards to location this hotel is great. We walked to the Shard, Tate Modern, Shakespeare's Globe, Borough Market and more.
-The nearest tube is Southwark, around a 5 minute walk. You can even walk to the London Bridge Tube.
-If you're a Park Run enthusiast then hop on from Southwark tube to Canada Water tube.

Overall it was a great stay. If I was a betting man I would predict that this hotel will gradually raise its room rates due to the increasing popularity of this hotel.",4,2016,09,04
120,Very nice hotel,Stayed 3 nights and it was a great experience. The room was large and extremely nice. There was strictly no view besides a brick wall 3 meters from the window but the benefit being that the room was totally quite which was more important to me being on a business trip. Great staff and nice breakfast. For London it was an amazing value. ,5,2016,09,03
120,Special night away from home,"We got to the hotel very early and our room wasn't ready. The lovely check-in staff offered to call us as soon as the room was ready, so we went to the hotel restaurant for breakfast. 
The same check-in staff called while we were still having breakfast and brough our key cards directly to us at the table.
When we left the restaurant we realised they have waived the bill because the food took a bit too long to arrive although we didn't complain at all as we were just having a nice relaxing morning and weren't fussed.
The staff and services are absolutely excellent. Our room was lovely, possibly the nicest Hilton we have stayed at. 
We would like to thank the hotel staff for making our day off a very comfortable one.
Will definitely return.",5,2016,09,02
120,One night stay,"Very modern and funky with a great atmosphere. Self service check in was easy and quick and room had everything you could need
Everything in the room is controlled by an iPad including great aircon. 
Great breakfast with plenty of hot fresh food as well as a good selection from the continental breakfast

Would definitely recommend a stay if you need somewhere as a base to look around or just for a night ",4,2016,09,02
120,quick visit,"Overall excellent, only downside was inferior service in the bar. The overall efficiency & welcoming by the staff was very pleasing. For a London hotel, I would rate it 4+.  The location is excellent, with easy walking access to many attractions, together with ready access to local transportation.",5,2016,09,01
120,Birthday Sunday lunch,"Brilliant atmosphere, very friendly staff and great service in the restaurant. The food was excellent. The taster size puddings was a very good idea so you don't have the challenge of having to choose, you can pick anything or everything you fancy. The birthday cake made for me was to die for and a lovely surprise. I would definitely recommend the hotel to friends and family.
Jill Raynor",5,2016,09,01
120,Excellent Quality,The Hilton Bankside was perfectly situated just a few blocks from the Thames.  Accommodations and services exceed our expectations.  Transportation around the city was easily identifiable; buses ran along the adjoining street and with the Southwark tube stop around the corner.  Our next holiday in London will include accommodations by this hotel.,5,2016,08,30
120,Everything is great,"The hotel is very quiet, and the staff is kindness, patient, and helpful. Hotel is near Southwark underground station,  traffic is convenient. I have stayed for have experience a great tour in London, especially in Hilton bankside hotel.",5,2016,08,30
120,Paul from Australia ;;staff so lovely and helpful," A very pleasant stay after a long journey.Staff were able to do early entry without me asking.The room was excellent ;clean and pleasant.Staff without fail were always pleasant and very helpful.i thoroughly recommend this hotel .I booked through Flightcentre.Great deal  ",5,2016,08,28
120,Perfect,"We stay at Hilton brand hotels a lot, in various countries, and this has to be by far the best. The whole hotel has a great atmosphere from its distinct design to its very helpful staff. We enjoyed several cocktails in the bar and also made use of the executive lounge which is also very good and is open for breakfast and from 6pm-10pm. We will most likely stay here whenever we are in London in the future!",5,2016,08,28
120,Pristine Quality,"My partner and I did a quick weekend get-away for our 3 year anniversary and we saw that they had lower-than-average prices for their junior suites. We jumped on the deal... and we're overwhelmingly happy we did!

This hotel knows quality, customer service, and excellence. The concierge asked about our experience at the play from the night before (they remembered) and they gave us a brief and informative introduction to the hotel when we checked in. It was great knowing what extra amenities we received per our booking.

We were blown away by the room and wish we could have the shower and bathroom for our own house! Additionally, the little extras in the room were the ""cherry on top"". Lastly, the decor, selection, and service for the breakfast bar was superb.

If you're looking for a quality place to stay, then we highly consider this location.",5,2016,08,28
120,Incredible time,"We stayed at the hotel over a long weekend in July. The hotel is new and very modern. The location is very central. There is a subway station close by. You can walk to the Tate modern and the Millennium bridge. You can also walk to the tower bridge and the London eye. Our room was modern and clean. The rainbow shower was great. We only had one window at the room and it were a little bit dark. It was very hot during our stay and the air condition worked very well. It was very convenient that the mini bar was free of charge. The crew was very friendly and helpful, but sometimes it seems to be that there where not enough service members to manage the crowd. The breakfast had wide variety. We will definitely come back.  
",4,2016,08,28
120,Excellent hotel,"Everything was great but especially the beds,  fantastic nights sleep.  You feel like you're floating! 
The Oxbo restaurant is amazing,  especially if you sit near the restaurant kitchen like we did.  Food is top notch! ",5,2016,08,27
120,Excellent!,"Just back from two nights in London where we stayed at this hotel. 

There was some confusion on our arrival with regards the room we had booked but the delightful receptionist Evi, dealt with it brilliantly and we were off to an excellent start!

Room was really nice and well appointed. This is a newly built Hilton and is in top condition. Facilities also excellent. There is a small gym and a beautiful indoor swimming pool in the basement which we used several times. 

Location is perfect and we didn't use a cab/tube at all. Everything we wanted to see is within walking distance esp the river paths and this really is an excellent base from which to explore central London. 

We didn't eat at the hotel in the evening but breakfast was a triumph. Worthy of special note is the homemade honey granola, the fresh orange and the made to order omelettes. Plenty of staff around always keen to help without being too intrusive.

The only things that could be improved is the pillows (too soft but doubtless could have been changed had we asked!) and the coffee served in a pot at breakfast (too weak for me but there is an alternative coffee machine in the breakfast room which is much better!) 

My wife even liked the aroma in the lobby!! 

We liked it here - a lot. 

",5,2016,08,27
120,Perfect,"Stayed here last weekend for 2 nights.

Hotel was spotless, breakfast was good too. All the staff in the hotel are eager to assist and are very helpful. 

This hotel was in a good place, we walked around London rather that using the buses or underground but if you wanted they are close by.

The rooms are big but if you want London views you need to stay on the higher floors, we could see st Paul's from our room :) 6th floor.

Great hotel and I would stay again if I could.

Thanks to all the staff.

",5,2016,08,26
120,Wonderful experience,"Excellent facilities, staff, location and overall experience. All staff were very professional, friendly and keen to make us feel special. Room was beautiful, modern and comfortable. Lovely restaurant and pool facilities. 10/10",5,2016,08,26
120,Wonderful and Refreshing Hilton,"One of the Best Hiltons we ever stayed in. Well appointed rooms, Upbeat Lobby, Marble and Wood surrounding you. The staff were ALL Friendly and Very Helpful. We were offered an upgrade to the Executive room and Lounge for a fee. So glad we went with the upgrade. Well worth the money. First time in Bankside and will return again to Hilton Bankside. Great area, lots of restaurants, pubs and stores. Tube stations within a few minutes walk. 
Plenty of good food and drinks inside the hotel. Must stay here. You will not be disappointed.",5,2016,08,25
120,Superb service ,"I have stayed in a number of hotels across London, UK and the world and I have never received the quality of service my son and I received at Hilton bankside.  It was absolutely superb from the moment we arrived till we left.  All staff were attentive and so smiley - it was a total pleasure to be there and will definitely return! ",5,2016,08,25
120,Definitely one of the best Hiltons,"I've stayed in quite a few recently and found the standard very mixed. This one was very good. 
Great location that i had previously passed over. 10 min to tubes both Jubilee and Circle and District lines. Plenty of taxis. Smart area s much better than a few years ago. Plenty of convenience stores and chain cafes around, Leon, Pret etc. 5 mins from Tate Modern. 
Staff were outstanding, so friendly and helpful. At all times of day and night. Restaurant as still open at 11pm which was great. Bar was showing the Olympics, discreetly and a reasonable outside seating area. As you would expect Thursday night was very busy, and Friday and Saturday much quieter as business people are not evident. 
Room was very spacious, even big, comfortable bed, good shower, wifi worked. A bit masculine in terms of decor, a lot of greys and browns. And the same comment applies to the rest of the hotel. Stuffed animal heads real or not, are way over the top in the restaurant, steak or not.
Pool was warm and good enough to get some exercise.

But its not 5 star. Its just small things that would make the difference. 

Would stay again if i can find a deal.",4,2016,08,24
120,Unexpectedly great!,"Stayed here for a couple of nights as they had a huge special. I thought it would be cheap and cheerful but was surprised to find a new hotel on par with top Hilton standards. Service was right, hotel was clean and rooms were large. No real view, but walking distance to the Southbanks. ",5,2016,08,24
120,Upbeat and Trendy,"Upbeat new hotel in a trendy corner of central London now transformed from an industrial past to a somewhat gentrified mix of shiny glass offices and apartments amongst the now cleansed Victorian era  railway ducts. 

It shares an address with the hip Gordon Ramsey restaurant and the like.

I treated myself to a paid suite upgrade , so had a fantastic room. The executive lounge was superb - not an afterthought like some properties , but a genuinely pleasant place to spend an hour or two. Not too over crowded and the complimentary buffet was superb. 

Didn't use the gym , but it looked more than adequate. 

I would definitely return - it's a little walk to Waterloo and not that convenient for my current client , but it surpassed all expectations 
",5,2016,08,23
120,Great hotel and location,"The Hilton Bankside is a very nice property, in a great location. Tate Modern is across the street, as are many cafes, bars. Feels a bit like a boutique hotel. Excellent service at concierge and reception.",5,2016,08,23
120,Lovely Hotel,"Stayed here for 5 nights and was very impressed. The lady who checked me in was so friendly and welcoming, all you could ask for as a first impression. I'm just disappointed I didn't catch her name! (Sunday 14th August). 

The rooms were so clean and spacious, everything we needed for our week away, and five minutes from the tube. Housekeeping were wonderful and I can't praise them enough. 

The breakfast hostess was welcoming and friendly each morning and everyone I came in contact said hello or good morning which makes all the difference! 

I hope to return the next time I'm in London. ",5,2016,08,22
120,Lovely hotel. Bit further away from everything than you may think,"This is a typical Hilton with excellent service, plentiful and varied breakfast and restaurant facilities, a lovely pool and gym, and the room was very clean with high quality furnishings and fixtures. However, since it is called ""Bankside"", I kind of expected it to be on the bank of the Thames. It isn't. Plus, it is a good half an hour / 45 minute walk to the main throng of London. We weren't using the Tube on this particular trip, and the walk was a little than I had planned for. From Waterloo, it is a walk along the South Bank, past the OXO building and behind Blackfriars Bridge and station. So this hotel is not quite where I expected it to be, that is the negative I have about this hotel.",5,2016,08,22
120,Amazing property,"A great property.
The staff extremely friendly and professional.
Our suite was stunning: modern, very clean and extremely comfortable.
The breakfast delicious.
The location was excellent, walking distance to tubes, buses, shopping and more.
We will definitely be back!",5,2016,08,22
120,A great gem of a hotel in fab location,"Great spot close to Thames, lovely décor and interior in very new hotel.  Bedrooms were lovely and had all the essentials you need.  breakfast was plentiful and enjoyable.
the only small niggle was that we were unable to get a drink after 11pm which was annoying (especially as the barman just let us stand there for about 10 minutes without bothering to advise us of this fact)",5,2016,08,22
120,"Perfect location for Tate Modern, Globe and great restaurants","Staff was wonderful, loved the safe neighborhood, great location within short  walking distance to Tate, Shakespeare's Globe and waterfront dining options. Staff was wonderful. Really beautiful modern, quiet clean rooms. Will definitely stay there again. ",5,2016,08,21
120,Sam's Hen-Do - Fantastic Day,We had 25 Ladies for my friends Hen Do Lunch - The food was amazing - All you could eat and flowing Presecco for 2 hours - Desserts was so yummy and Sweeties too - The lunch was £40.00 each - But worth every penny - We had helpful staff and lovely music playing by an up and coming young guatarist - The Hotel was Beautiful and I would recommend this for Ladies getting together for small parties and Lunches - Loved the Ladies room - 9/10 for me - We shall return - Beautiful Resturant - Thank you - Jilly xx,4,2016,08,21
120,Fantastic hotel for birthday celebration,"I booked this hotel for the night for a birthday celebration. Definitely 5* throughout the whole hotel. We weren't disappointed in the slightest. Polite, smartly-dressed and helpful staff. Large, clean rooms with comfy beds. Breakfast had a large variety and food was delicious. Would definitely recommend and stay again.",5,2016,08,21
120,7 stars hotel,"Super super super nice staff, friendly and always ready to well organize everything... We really enjoyed, special thanks to Peer who made my son birthday wonderful...Also very good restaurant inside restaurant so if you are tired of all day visiting London that would be right choice... We been only 1 time at swimming pool, very nice and relaxing... Also Gym super modern ...thank you Hilton hotel , we really enjoyed our vacation and next time when we are at London it will be for sure Hilton bankside ...",5,2016,08,20
120,Good hotel but disappointing staff,Great hotel with great facilities. Good clean rooms with nice decorations. However we accidentally broke a mirror on the last day and got charged 130 even though we had paid a deposit! We eventually got the price down the 65 however it turned out to be a 300 pound hotel stay which was a lot of money! Was a shame it had to end like this especially for a nice birthday break but except that was a great hotel. ,3,2016,08,20
120,Absolutely great ,"This hotel really is magnificent.   5 stars in every way.  Rooms spacious.  With being a hilton gold got a room upgrade and free snacks.  Staff are wonderful and bar is excellent.

Rooms and hotel appear very new.  Location is great.  

The best part of this hotel are the beds and the pillows and comforter.  Seriously had great sleep and talk about not wanting to get out of bed.  Will need to ask where the bedding is from.

Unfortunately makes other Hilton hotels not look so good.  Will be back.",5,2016,08,20
120,Cosy with very helpful staff ,"I was there for 5 days during the fasting month and the service was great. 

Good in room dining service. They've ensured that my requests for Halal meals are well-attended. 

The room was cosy and I can see it being well-tidied each time I got back in the evenings/nights.

Will definitely come here again in my next visit to London.",4,2016,08,19
120,Superb in all aspects ,"We booked through booking.com and for 2 nights it was a great location. Tge staff were fantastic, couldn't do enough to help. Our room was spacious, sleek, clean and had everything we needed. The breakfast  (included in our price) was exceptional with everything available! What wasn't there the staff would get- I asked for soya milk. Gluten free options were also available. We would definitely recommend this hotel and would be happy to return in the future?

120,Fabulous Hotel,We stayed as part of a family vacation and this hotel was exceptional from start to finish and will be our new home in the city. The addition of a great pool makes this a great retreat with the kids after a long day in London. ,5,2016,08,19
120,A great first visit,"We booked this hotel mainly due to its location. It turned out to be a very good choice. Friendly, helpful staff who went out of their way to make sure we enjoyed our visit and our room was very comfortable.",5,2016,08,18
120,Newest hotel in London with a great location!,"Let's start with the fact that the hotel is NEW (built in October 2015)!! Buildings in London are old and this place is modern and chic. Great location near Southwark station, London Bridge, and the Shard. Hotel staff is very accommodating and friendly. Rooms are very clean and the breakfast was delicious with a nice variety of foods. They even provide turndown services and offer room service for breakfast. The only downfall is that the hotel is only has 7 floors and is surrounded by tall buildings, so most rooms don't have nice views.",4,2016,08,18
120,"Fresh, modern and spacious hotel - a true delight","This hotel has very spacious rooms (30 sqm) as standard with plenty of room to move around.  Very modern appearance and furnishings (you'd hope so being built in 2016), incredibly comfortable beds & linen with over-all great service.

Though in a business district, would be fantastic for business or leisure stays -- peak business periods and short notice bookings can be a little expensive, but outside of the business week or in advance the rates are surprisingly low for the quality.

Breakfast offering is pretty good with cooked and cold options, pancakes & omelettes on demand and a large selection of pastries.  Can be a little expensive one-off though, so look to get a breakfast inclusive rate which can work out much cheaper.

Two minor complaints, first the cost of room service is staggeringly high even for room service. Second, they have a ""space perfume"" in the foyer which to me honestly smells like rubbing alcohol - not a fan.. fortunately it's only in the foyer and does not extend into the restaurants, common areas or rooms.

There are 2 convenience stores right outside open until 11pm, and several restaurants just a few minutes away.  Highly recommended, one of my favorite hotels anywhere.",5,2016,08,17
120,5 Star Service,"So what makes a 5* hotel?  

Well all the usual things: location, location, location, clean modern rooms with deliciously comfy beds; great wet room bathroom with rain shower; luxury toiletries; plush towels; complimentary items in the fridge; staff that smile and make sure your stay is fabulous - like Happy Anniversary card and cake to share; fresh milk brought up in minutes for in-room coffee and tea; well stocked and beautifully decorated Executive Lounge... Need I go on???

We will definitely be back Hilton London Bankside!!!  Thanks for making our 24th Wedding Anniversary truly wonderful!!!!",5,2016,08,17
120,Was excellent ,"We had a 1 bedroom suite on the executive floor - 7th fl- that was great because we essentially had two bedrooms but not expensive - definitely worth it - all non alcoholic stuff from minibar free plus a special executive cafe/lounge near the main oxbo restaurant where they had virtually unlimited drinks, snacks and a separate breakfast if you want - really a beautiful hotel and the neighborhood was open close to the walkway on the Thames and so we liked it way better than marylebone where we stayed last year which was more dense and a bit too close to bustling commerce - this hotel btw is close to a huge farmers market and the London and tower bridges - all walkable - we really liked this place  ",5,2016,08,17
120,Couldn't be better,"As written in many reviews, the hotel is brand new, with a modern yet elegant vibe.
What made the difference to me is the service though. Everyone was super nice and efficient, from the check in to the check out (and a special mention to the cleaning lady). 
Most of all they were flexible (a thing that - for instance - I didn't find in the Hilton double tree hotel in Kensington, which denied the same request I made to this hotel and was accepted instead).
The executive room means access to the executive lounge for breakfast, afternoon tea and appetizers before dinner: very good quality of food. 
The pool is very nice either.
I asked to extend my stay but unfortunately they were fully booked (and I understand why).",5,2016,08,16
120,By far the best Hilton we've visited ,"I booked this hotel near Christmas on a last minute deal as a surprise for my boyfriend.

Whilst still quite pricey, especially for mid week London I was not disappointed.

The staff were fantastic and really welcoming and the decor was fab. It's a really modern venue that made us feel at home. The room was really large with all the mod cons and the shower...oh the shower, but it felt homely and welcoming. 

The dressing gowns and slippers were also a fantastic and welcomed treat too.

We didn't want to leave.

",5,2016,08,16
120,"Wonderful stay, amazing staff","The staff here are superb. Per the reception manager is very charming .

120,Brilliant,"Excellent location, not far from the tube and close enough to walk to many of the main sites.
The hotel is absolutely beautiful and the room and bathroom spotlessly clean, very comfortable bed.
The staff made the stay however, from check in staff to the lounge staff to the cleaners all were absolutely lovely and helpful.
Would certainly stay again",5,2016,08,14
120,Great place,We spent last week over there and was very nice time. All team was very kind and always ready to help your requires. Great gin tonics at distillery. Touching modern Tate is very good connected to bank facilities and southwark underground station.,5,2016,08,14
120,"GREAT ROOM , GREAT LOCATION","We stayed one night mid week in a twin bedded de luxe room. All was superb, comfortable beds, complimentary soft drinks, wi fi if needed, good tv and nice shower room with a great shower, although there was no bath which was a pity.
Breakfast was excellent , a wide range of cooked food as well as cold buffet pastries etc.( £20 per person) Serve yourself coffee was poor. The only draw back of the whole experience.
The location was superb....near many interesting places for tourists as well as the City, West End and major stations.Staff were helpful and friendly. Our room on the first floor was quiet. We would certainly return if we needed a good place to stay in London,",4,2016,08,14
120,Perfect location,"You cannot beat the location, steps from the Globe, the Tate and the Millennium bridge and walking distance from several tube and train stations. The hotel is clean and functional and the rooms are comfortable. Very comfortable. The lighting is a tiny bit dim. The decor is ultra modern and the place is spotless. The bathrooms are very cool. There was no view at all from our room but that was fine. The staff are helpful and friendly.",5,2016,08,13
120,Lovely Hotel and great service.,Just back from London and stayed here for 3 nights.This hotel is perfectly situated for getting to all the sights. The staff are very helpful and the breakfast is excellent. The beds are extremely comfy and the rooms are very well equipped. The only quibble that I would have is that the coffee pods were not replenished after we used them on the first night. The heated pool is great yo rrlax in after wslking all day.It was a very pleasant stay. I would definitely stay here again. ,5,2016,08,13
120,Nice hotel,"2 nights spent here. Was upgraded to an executive room with access to executive lounge. Lovely lounge with very tasty snacks from 18.00-20.00. Room was spotless and beds so comfortable. Nice to have free snacks and non alcoholic drinks from the mini bar.
Bathroom is super. Big shower and nice toiletries.
All staff very friendly and helpful.
Agree with a previous review that the breakfast was not the best I have had. Good cold selection, but I felt that the hot buffet could be improved and it wasn't that hot. Despite this I would stay here again and hope that I can soon!",4,2016,08,13
120,Excellent value for money,"Superb room,breakfast,service,wifi,location.Best stay in London(personal)by far.The subway station was five minutes walk,there was cafe Costa,all day market,restaurands one step from the door and the character of the neighbourhood was very clean and safe.",5,2016,08,13
120,Perfect location,"Hilton London Bankside is, for us, the perfect location in London. It is with in walking distance of about 90% of what we wanted to see. We were within a short block to the Tate Modern and a good hike to the Tate British. Strand St. was a pleasant walk as was Leicester Sq., National Gallery and in my case Guy's and St. Thomas Emergency ward. Since we are both walkers we would stay there again for sure.",5,2016,08,13
120,Top hotel,"Stayed here last weekend with my son and can honestly say this is a top hotel. Lovely staff, stayed I a deluxe room which was fab. I have stayed at most of the Hilton hotels in London and this is up there with the best of them. Will stay here again on our next visit. ",5,2016,08,13
120,"Most comfortable, luxurious room we've ever stayed","Absolutely gorgeous, modern and comfortable room. We stayed in 6 different hotels on our trip and this one by far outdid the other ones in comfort, luxury and service. Great location, quiet and close to public transportation and landmarks.",5,2016,08,12
120,"Very good, but not quite perfect","I stayed here for a couple of nights at the end of July. 

If you're travelling from Southwark tube station, follow the orange lampposts that lead you to the Tate Modern – you'll end up right at the hotel. Blackfriars station is also just a short walk away. There's a Sainsbury's Local right next door and a Tesco Express across the road – perfect if you've forgotten anything or want some late-night snacks!

Check-in was fine and the welcome was warm. I have a blue HHonors membership and this was acknowledged. I was offered a paid upgrade and declined. I didn't realise until I left that Blue members can request a free late check-out. It may well have been declined but I shall bear that in mind. As with the excellent Hilton at Wembley, the smell in the lobby is just beautiful. Really lovely fragrance.

I had a room on the first floor. It was spacious and comfortable. The free drinks were replenished without fuss and the bathroom was spotless. The large bed had lovely soft pillows and there was also a nice chaise longue. The TV was good with plenty of channels. There didn't seem to be too many interactive services, though, which I am seeing more and more often in modern hotels. The work desk was good for eating at and for working on my laptop. The air con worked well and was quiet yet efficient. I really liked the unique design of the lamps by the bed. Unfortunately (and this was probably just me), I couldn't figure out how to just have the bedside lights on without the main lights in the room also being on. It wasn't a big issue, as it was still a nice ambience, but sometimes I just want the bedside light on.

I thought the breakfast was okay, but could have been better. Just a few minor things that I encountered during my stay that weren't huge issues but did prevent everything from being perfect. The breakfast staff were excellent, though. 

Checking out was efficient and my invoice was emailed to me straight away – a very neat touch. 

I would give it another try here as all in all it was a good stay. The hotel was modern and clean and the staff were very good.  I'd recommend it as a good base in Central London - it was quiet and yet you're so close to the wonderful South Bank.",4,2016,08,12
120,Well located ,"Modern hotel with a good feel. I did not use the facilities but it had a pool and the bar and restaurants looked good. Well located as just behind Tate modern and lots of reasonable places to eat nearby - tend to be more the bigger chains near the Thames and Tate but if you walk the other way you can find some nice smaller ones. 

My room disappointed as a corner room of odd shape. I can accept no view but the window shed little light into the room and it just felt dark.  Seemed to be this type of room on every floor. This sways my view of this hotel to average with all other aspects very good. My family had a room on another floor with a view to the Shard, so they were happy!

Staff were polite and attentive. ",3,2016,08,12
120,Fabulous Hotel,"This hotel is one of the best in London, the staff are really professional and helpful, the hotel is very clean and the scent in the lobby is relaxing. 
Rooms are cleaned daily and beds are comfy. 
The breakfast buffet is good and has egg cooking station, beans and mushrooms, sausage and beacon ""not halal"", cheese, fruits and bakeries.
The hotel is 5 minutes walking from the tube station.
In general it was a great stay for me and my family and definitely it will be our hotel in the next holiday in London.",5,2016,08,11
120,Great hotel great location,"If you want a hotel to access the south bank.Borough Market,The Shard,Oxo Tower,Globe are all within 20mins walk.Highly recommended.Cool style,Great service,Good food.The most comfortable bed ever.Go there !",5,2016,08,11
120,Perfect hotel,"Wow what an amazing hotel, very modern and an excellent location. The room was fantastic, service excellent and very friendly check in. The bar serving cocktails was lovely! Didn't have breakfast so cannot comment on that. Will definitely return there.",5,2016,08,11
120,My favourite hotel in London,"I've been to this hotel more times and I always loved it. It's new, modern and very nice. The gym is well equipped and it also has a pool. They surprised me with something almost every evening - nibbles, a bottle of wine, chocolates, which is very nice of them. They have the best breakfast from all the hotels I have ever visited, even with freshly cooked food from the chefs.",5,2016,08,11
120,Weekend stay for anniversary,"3 Night stay at the Bankside, great hotel, had already booked an executive room but was asked if we wanted an upgrade to a junior suite, when I looked it up I don’t think it was any cheaper so not much of an upgrade, however the room was excellent. The hotel was easy to find, we used the tube from Kings cross and got off at Southwalk station which was an easy 5 minutes walk and felt very safe. The room came with complimentary access to the executive lounge with free drinks and snacks for 2 hours each night and breakfast in the morning, the staff were very good and service excellent.
Great area for getting around London with easy tube access and only 15 – 20 minutes walk to Covent Garden. A few good pubs around the hotel which we only had time to part explore. Would definitely stay again but the executive suites are a bit of a treat.",5,2016,08,10
120,Excellent place to stay - will be glad to come back,"I spent a night here in August 2016 and loved it. This hotel is a real island of comfort and quiet in the middle of the hustle and bustle of London. Check-in was fast and friendly, and the room was the highlight of the stay - well-appointed, very comfortable, and the mattress was super comfortable and great to sleep on. The air con system was top quality. Cleanliness of the room was top quality. The bathroom and shower too were of an excellent quality, although the spotlight shining down on to the toilet was a bit weird, as was the wolf-type statue thing in the bedroom. The hotel has a supermarket next door, which is a welcome one-stop-shop for snacks, toiletries, etc.",5,2016,08,09
120,Modern hotel with good facilities,"Hilton Bankside is a modern hotel with great facilities. Rooms are well furnished and Executive Lounge has a nice ambience and is very relaxing. We were extended an early check in and high floor room. Breakfast was really good with lots of choice and high quality food. Front desk staff were very friendly and helpfull. Swimming pool was warm and quiet. However stay was not up to par of previous visits. Housekeeping was poor, room was noisy from guest above us at 4am and of roadworks directly outside our bedroom window at 7.45am. Coffee in lounge was from a machine and was undrinkable, no morning newspaper delivered, no water in room and three attempts to get some and various other issues. Will we come back - most definitely. This is a very good Hilton overall, infact it is one of the best and I am confident our next stay will be better.",4,2016,08,09
120,"Great new hotel, hidden gem","I tried this new Hilton and was really impressed. Fantastic service, very personalized, excellent exec lounge and main dining room. Modern clean architecture and design. Big bathroom in a well laid out and easy to use room. Well served by buses and tubes, and an easy walk to many London attractions.  ",5,2016,08,08
120,Hilton bankside,Lovely hotel in a very good location the staff were extremely pleasant and helpful all the time you couldn't ask for any more. The only gripe I have personally was prices in the bar which I thought were very expensive and plus a 10% service charge.,5,2016,08,08
120,Excellent stay,"we went to London for a birthday treat and were delighted from arrival until departure.  Location excellent and staff fantastic..very friendly and helpful. Restaurant very good with the wonderful services of Matteo, Stefano, Faris and Sarwar. Superb customer service at all times. Beds very comfortable and wonderful shower.  John, Concierge, was so helpful to ensure we seen all that we had wanted to do in in the capital.  Will definitely return to this hotel when next in London..keep up the great work",5,2016,08,08
120,Great hotel,"We really liked this hotel very much. It is not in the very center of town, but we were preseantly surprised by the Southbank. There is the Tate Modern 1 minute away from the hotel, lots of great restaurants and cafés (which is good because instead of paying 20 pounds for breakfast we had a croissant and coffee at Paul's), and we also found the bus RV1 about 2 minutes from the hotel which takes you to Covent Garden. The hotel itself is super clean and modern. We faced a wall, but this didn't bother us too much. The service was very efficient, in the morning, and they also came back every evening to prepare the bed and bring a fresh water bottle. We'd definitely book this hotel again!",5,2016,08,08

120,Superb location and friendly staff,"This is was my first experience staying at this hotel. I opted for no breakfast as the Borough Market is only a 10-minute walk away where the best fresh food is on.
The hotel is new and the rooms are spacious with great calming interior design and nice big windows that allow natiral light to brighten the day. The tube is minutes away and the area is historic, safe and very nice to walk around.",5,2016,08,07
120,"Excellent Hotel, Good Location","We were staying in London for a special weekend away, and have stayed in several different Hilton Hotels previously - I'm pleased to say this one lived up to expectations. It's stylish and luxurious, with friendly and helpful staff, and is in a good (and relatively quiet) location, just a short walk from Southwark tube station, Tate Modern and Shakespeare's Globe. We stayed in an executive room, which was great - plenty of space and amenities, including complimentary soft drinks in the fridge. We dined in the OXBO restaurant one night, which was nice, although there wasn't really enough variety in the menu for my liking. But the food was excellent, as was the service. I'd happily stay here again - it's close enough to all the main attractions of central London, but not right in the thick of it.",5,2016,08,07
120,Fantastic Hotel,We had a really great stay in this luxury hotel. The room was very clean and tidy od course and the hotel staff was super friendly. Overall a superbe experience and the price for it is also more than acceptable!,5,2016,08,06
120,Fantastic,"We We arrived and got instantly upgraded to an executive room with complimentary soft drinks and snacks all day as well as complimentary afternoon tea and open bar all for £35 upgrade. The staff are really helpful and friendly and very professional. The rooms are new and modern, comfiest beds ever and amazing shower! Just love it all!",5,2016,08,06
120,Hilton Bankside is Money!,"This Hilton in London is EVERYTHING you need for a hotel that is 8 hours flying time away:

- newly renovated and luxurious: rooms, bedding, furniture, bathroom,
- EXCELLENT customer service, including doorman, front desk, kitchen staff, housekeeping,
- reasonably priced,
- close to many things (e.g., Borough Market, Tate Modern, several subway lines, and more),
- great restaurants, including very good lunch (Hilton Gold and Diamond included), and a fantastic exec lounge.",5,2016,08,05
120,"Hotel nice, service good but Management lacks customer orientation and vision","The hotel experience was in principle good; The rooms are nicely furnished (though small), bathroom is nice and good amenities in general.
I was travelling with my family but also for business. Location is good, close to Tate modern, London bridge, restaurants and bars.
Will then explain why the 1 star: I was travelling with a small child (3 yo). She was playing and running in the lobby as most children do when accidentally hit and broke a lamp. The surprise came a couple of weeks later, when in my credit card I found a bill for 50  pounds from Hilton. Unexplained. No email, invoice notice... When inquired the Hotel, they said was the cost for breaking the lamp! 
Firs of all, in my opinion this accidents happen and shouldn't be charged to customers (especially kids). Second of all, in case that is the case, minimum an invoice should be sent beforehand. I spend thousands of dollars each year in Hilton chain (I'm a very frequent business traveller) or at least used to. From now on Hilton is banned for me in any case, HHonors account will be closed too. Congratulations on your business decision how to treat your loyal customers!",1,2016,08,05
120,"Modern, Clean and in a Great Location.","It ticks almost every box whether travelling on business or leisure.

On the South Bank between Waterloo and London Bridge (near Tate) you are surrounded by the city, with views toward The Shard from some rooms and nearby there are supermarkets / pubs for 'cheap eats' as well as one of Gordon Ramsay's eateries. I mention that because the drinks / food are a little high price in OxBo / Distillery if you are not careless with the pennies.

The Southwark Tube will connect you quickly to the Underground network and is a short walk away, certain guests was call 'cousins' (ahem) will find this too far because it's not actually within six yards but for the rest of the world that equates to about a three minute brisk stroll, five minute walk or twenty minute waddle if a point has to be proven. Have a nice day..., remember your poncho... We used Uber Exec a few times to get to the theatre and an E-Class / S-Class was circa £15 to the West End, well worth it.

Our Executive room was on a corner aspect with very modern facilities and seriously the most comfortable King bed I have slept in for years, even by hotel standards with only one small failing - as my wife says, the room was designed by a man - that there's no vanity mirror in the bedroom other than a full length one inside the cupboard. For a woman (or indeed modern male) doing your make-up and hair styling (moustache and beard for the modern male) on the bedroom floor ro get near a power point, for the provided hair dryer, is a small but important over-sight. The aircon works very well and silently, the exterior noise level is almost zero even though the doors do close quite heavily and the little touches but the service staff absolutely spot-on.

The Executive lounge is airy and has a beautiful design. Those familiar with the lounge facilities might I tell you these are some of the best I have experienced, the half five complimentary items are a good standard and well worth taking advantage of before your evening arrangements. They serve breakfast in OxBo and the choices are extensive, the pastries and traditional cooked items are supported by 'on request' items such as pancakes, omelettes and poached eggs etc as well as East Asian choices. Well done, a very international provision.

We used the pool / spa each day of our visit and in general it was very relaxing when not busy, it's quite small so this can happen easily but overall a great facility in a capital hotel where space is a premium. I'd like to see a steam room / sauna though if your pockets can stretch to that in the future.

Would absolutely return.",5,2016,08,05
120,Amazing birthday stay!,"This hotel is everything you would expect from a Hilton hotel. The service and facilities are second to none. 

It is well worth paying for the upgraded room to give you complimentary soft drinks and snacks from the mini bar and access to the executive lounge, as well as a nicer room. 

We arrived at around 1pm and were able to check in and also had access to refreshments in the executive lounge. 

The pool is gorgeous and the gym is what you'd expect from a hotel gym. 

The little things really matter at this hotel also, including a turn down service and consistently genuinely helpful staff.

The breakfast has a great selection also including waffles, pancakes and omelettes cooked to order.

Aside from the above, the hotel is in a fantastic location. 5 minute walk from Southwark station in one direction and around 10 mins to St Pauls in the other. As well as being tucked just behind the Tate Modern. 

Overall, could not fault the stay at all. 

Thanks again. ",5,2016,08,05
120,Brilliant!,"This hotel is truly amazing, the restaurant is spacious and well run, the staff are always friendly and ready to help. The food was delisous which was even better with the 5* service. The hallways were really nice and clean then getting into the room I was amazed, the bathroom was my favourite in the deluxe room, very clean and tidy couldn't fault it in any way ! Thanks for such a great experience!",5,2016,08,04
120,First class one-nighter,"Can't really speak highly enough. Obviously benefits from being new but all decor really smart and on trend. One night only but excellent value. Loved the room. Not massive but very modern. I love big bathrooms and this fitted bill with walk-in shower, bright and ultra-smart. We were told there was no view which I thought was a courteous touch. When you've got one of the best cities on the planet outside the front door, who cares? The location is superb, near to South Bank, Borough market, Shard. Tube a 10 min stroll. Pubs/eateries everywhere. We thought the turn-back service and slippers was an excellent touch. Staff really smart, professional and courteous. Recommended. ",5,2016,08,02
120,Good tourist base,"This was our second visit here and we were made welcome after a long day sight seeing, A visit to the new Tate modern extension was our last stop and we caught glimpses of the hotel from the viewing deck. We made good use of the comfortable executive lounge. Breakfast gave us an excellent choice of a wide range of delicious food one of the best buffets we have experienced. We enjoyed the stay",5,2016,08,02
120,Just me being English,"Lovely hotel, absolutely gorgeous, friendly staff and lovely decor. 

However, it all went a bit strange..

I went out for the evening and came back to find the bed had been folded back and for some bizarre reason, a serviette and a pair of slippers had been placed by the side of the bed. 

Perhaps this is the reserved English part of me but I found this profoundly creepy, disturbing and weird. 

I do not need my stuff unpacked, I do not (and I can't say this strongly enough), want my stuff touched by a stranger. 

This really really put me off, the thought that someone had been in my room and felt that they could make choices for me is not something that sits well with me. 

Hilton. I know you meant well but this was a VERY unpleasant feeling for me. Can you not understand that some people would find this obtrusive?

I will be back, how could I not. But, I will make a point of telling the reception staff that nobody else goes into my room when I'm here for an overnight stay. 

",4,2016,08,01
120,Modern hotel,"The hotel is in a very good location, only a five-minute walk from Southwark Tube station. The décor is very modern, although the rooms did not have any character. Lovely walk-in shower and really comfortable bed. ""Free minibar"", which contains 2 bottles of water, 2 cokes and an orange juice.
The Executive Lounge had a sophisticated charm, but the food on offer was aimed just at meat-eaters or fish lovers.
Breakfast was fantastic, with loads of options and all of very high quality.
The staff was friendly and helpful.",5,2016,08,01
120,A Very Good Hotel,"A very good hotel in central London for less than $A300 is difficult to find but the Hilton London Bankside is one. It is very well placed with bus stops 5 minutes walk and tube stations 10-15 minutes away. It is also walking distance from many London sights.

The hotel is new, modern and very clean with a high level of amenities. The rooms are spacious and quiet with very comfortable fittings and beds.

The service of the lobby staff was excellent - friendly, helpful, attentive, efficient. We
did have several issues however with the staff cleaning the room. On several occasions we arrived back at the hotel around 4.00 pm and the room had not been serviced. We needed to ring to organise this.

They offer a fold down service and that is great but if you are going to offer it then it needs to be consistent. Some nights we had the bed turned down, waters provided, slippers laid out on both sides of the bed. Other nights slippers were laid out on one side. Other nights nothing was done. This was nothing but amusing and certainly dd not impact on the stay or the rating, but summed up the overall servicing of the rooms.

Overall, it is a very good hotel and worth staying in and I would certainly look at staying there again.",4,2016,08,01
120,Short two night break,"First time staying in this hotel, and will not be the last.  The staff were very helpful from arrival to departure.  Excellent swimming pool and gym.  Executive lounge is well worth the upgrade, especially after a day sightseeing.",5,2016,07,31
120,Fabulous hotel in great location,"Great hotel in a good location for the Tate Gallery and Globe Theatre, also with nearby Tube station. Whole hotel exceptionally clean with nice modern decor. Room was gorgeous with a big with a lovely bathroom. Can eat late in the bar which is good if you have been to see a show. However I am particularly disappointed that we were asked to pay a £100 deposit on arrival, to which we did not use, and the whole amount has still not be refunded over two weeks later. This is not satisfactory service and I am very unhappy with this situation. We were told it would take 3-7 days which I believe is still unsatisfactory. Internet banking is instantaneous. ",4,2016,07,30
120,Birthday trip,"First visit to this Hilton hotel.We will definitely be staying here again.
Staff very friendly and helpful.
Recommend the executive lounge.Plenty on offer.
Only negative was lighting in room was a bit diffused but otherwise
everything perfect.",5,2016,07,30
120,Excellent !,"Probably one of the best places I have stayed in my travel. Staff were really nice. They allowed to keep our bags till will checked in and the same with the check out. Although our check in started at 3pm, we were given a complimentary breakfast for no charge. I was able to even convert my dollars to pound for a very decent exchange rate. Swimming pool does not come with this rate in central London. Location is very close to Tate modern and London Eye. Nice neighborhood and very family friendly. Strongly recommend it !!!",5,2016,07,29
120,Totally worth it,"We got a room upgrade with access to the executive lounge which was totally worth the extra £40. Spacious room, friendly staff, good food, the bathroom was amazing (I'm very particular about hotel bathrooms). Very clean and spacious, new hotel, close to the subway. Book early as prices fluctuate like crazy!",5,2016,07,28
120,Right for the urban funkster,"The Hilton Bankside is new and in great condition. The staff are very willing to please. The rooms are modern minimilalist in style. Ask for a room with a shower rather than a bath/shower (unless you are desperate for a tub!). Great benefit/price ratio. We loved 9 nights here.
The location is excellent with the Themes about 100 metres away, busses within 100 metres and the Jubilee line on the tube easily accessible for quick access to the main tourist destinations.
The Southbank area is part new office and apartment blocks and part gritty factory renewal - perfect for the urban funkster on holiday.",5,2016,07,28
120,"Ok stay, lots of space for improvement","In general is an okay stay. I would say it's an average hilton hotel but not sure why it is a five-star. Hotel and its rooms are quite new and comfortable, but there are a lot of downside I've seen during my stay:

- Check-in staff was a bit cold and I had to ask about lounge/breakfast myself. I was a bit surprised to hear that I had to pay for an upgrade to Executive even though I was Diamond.
- NO BATHTUB in the Deluxe room. Not sure if they exist in higher category rooms.
- NO FRESH COFFEE at breakfast. They only provide a coffee machine, and the coffee tastes a bit funny. I find it hard to believe that no roasted coffee is offered at all.
- No steaming room. This is not much of a downside, just one nice thing to have.

I've heard very good things about the hotel but was really underwhelmed by this stay. Probably won't come back. The Conrad and Hilton Angel I've stayed at recently are much better.",3,2016,07,27
120,Beautiful rooms,"Very nice hotel just 1 street away from Tate Modern and a 5 minute walk from the subway.

120,Awesome ,"Great hotel, excellent location and super attentive staff. Very clean and modern facilities and right in the heart of Southwark. Highly recommend, decent room sizes although a little pricey, worth it as close to heaps of pubs, restaurants etc ",4,2016,07,26
120,Excellent service and lauxary space with reasonable price,Walking distance from Waterloo station. Suite room was less than 300 pounds including tax. It was called Junior Suite but had a full size living room. Service was excellent. I had breakfast in the executive lounge. My only frustration was they served few kinds of dishes without typical English foods.,5,2016,07,26
120,Beautiful hotel will definatley reccomend.,"This hotel, well what can I say.

Such friendly start, I ALWAYS ensure I stay at the Hilton wherever I am in the world as the service, and hotel is brilliant throughout. 

This has to be one of my favourite hotels to date, fresh sheets, fresh towels and what I wasn't expecting a full complimentary mini fridge with contents and dressing gowns.

After a hard days shopping this was needed for a girls night in.

The beds were incredibly comfy, I stayed with my sister

We had such a giggle, this is in a great location.",5,2016,07,26
120,Relaxed and Quiet Time,"Although built in the busy Bankside area of London, very near to the south bank of the Thames, the staff of the Hilton Bankside have achieved an oasis of calm. Very attentive staff look after your every need and are always pleasant. The hotel staff make this a sought after hotel where you can relax and enjoy a little bit of your life at a slower rate than on normal high streets.",4,2016,07,26
120,Short vacation stay.,"Good Rooms as expected from a fairly new Hotel.
Breakfast service a disaster to many people for the restaurant so at times no tables available and food depleted on buffet.
Asked for a room with a bath at reception just got a nasty pay or no help.Rooms with a bath were available.
Traffic to and from central London sometimes challenging but Cabs know their way around.",3,2016,07,26

120,Overnight business trip,"Excellent modern hotel with relaxed feel. Hotel was immaculate (I think it had only opened recently). Great location close to the city. Room was very comfortable and well equipped. Breakfast was very enjoyable. Small fitness room and pool with fruit, water and towels provided. I will use again next time I need to stay over on business.",5,2016,07,25
120,Overnight stay for appearance on Good Morning Britain ,"Lovely hotel.. Stayed courtesy of Good Morning Britain.. Couldn't have afforded it otherwise! How the other half live eh??
Executive suite was nice.. The view was a let down .. But it's central London and felt very luxurious. The breakfast was plentiful and staff were extremely courteous which was lovely 
",4,2016,07,25
120,Excellent Hilton,"This is possibly the best Hilton we've stayed in. The hotel is quite new hence spotless, everything works. The room is well designed, and is good on the eyes as well as functioning logically. The interior design throughout this hotel is fantastic, reminding me of some cool bars/ restaurants in Santa Monica. We dined at Oxbo and I really must recommend the steak tartare. The steak here is also excellent. We spent some time in the ultra cool and laid back bar, nursing our Porn Star Martinis. The staff are very friendly and helpful. Oh, and finally the breakfast was excellent. I could not recommend this place more. It is also a 3 mins walk to the South Bank and the Tate Modern. Need I say more??",5,2016,07,25
120,Very Good!,"Very nice hotel. I had the executive room and it was very nice and spacious. I liked the indoor pool, and the services provided in the executive lounge.  Its location is convenient walking distance from either Southwark or Blackfriars Tube Station.",5,2016,07,25
120,Overnight stay,"Beautiful hotel, very classy yet not pretentious. Staff are welcoming and lovely, yet not over the top. They actually come across as if they do care, rather that that they are being paid to care. The Distillery Bar is relaxing and warmly decorated, the bar staff are incredibly knowledgeable and enthusiastic.  The OXBO restaurant is absolutely first class, and not as expensive as you might think.  My room was scrupulously clean and fresh, the air con worked a treat on a hot day too.  I had a very well rested night.  Breakfast was an absolute pleasure, so much choice!  I loved my stay here and very much want to stay here again.",5,2016,07,25
120,Love this location. Great hotel.,"I really enjoyed my stay at the Hilton Bankside. I was traveling alone and the staff was helpful and welcoming. My room was comfortable, clean and designed well. As a diamond Hilton Honors member, I had access to the executive lounge and it was nice. They serve Breakfast in the morning and happy hour at night. There are restaurants within a short walking distance.",5,2016,07,24
120,Absolutely First Class Service,"We visited on our wedding night, checking in quite late. We got to our room to find rose petals sprinkled on our bed and some delicious chocolates and a slice of chocolate cake. They also offered us late checkout free of charge, which was incredibly welcome considering that we'd not got there until late that night - we really got to make the most of our stay. The service throughout was first class. Everyone is so polite and friendly, going out of their way to help you. The hotel is modern but welcoming. The bathroom was lovely and sleek, and the shower was huge. If I had an complaints at all, it would be that the pool area was not as good as it could be. I got a bit cold in the pool and it would have been nice to have had a separate jacuzzi to warm up in, or a steam room. But other than that, we had an absolutely fantastic stay. ",5,2016,07,24
120,Simply fantastic ,"I stayed here for one night and it was a faultless stay. The hotel was beautifully stylish and very modern with a clean room that had everything you would expect from a Hilton Hotel. 

The staff throughout the hotel were exquisite and very helpful. (I had forgotten my toothbrush and a dental kit was delivered to the room in under five minutes!)

The Oxbo restaurant and breakfast the following morning was very very nice with a range of choices at a good price.

A gym and pool were also available to use. Unfortunately I didn't have time to use these facilities but I had a look and it looked great. 

Thank you for a perfect stay.

120,Great place to stay,The hotel is lovely and facilities are great i would definitely stay again. reasonably priced but i think this is due to the location. being the other side of the water. however under ten quid in a cab to get to most places in the city the other side of the river.,4,2016,07,23
120,Fantastic!,"Each year I visit London for work for a couple of weeks and was booked at The Hilton Bankside this time instead of the usual other Hotel.  I had 15 nights here and just loved it.  What a great hotel, and so many fantastic places to eat near by. 

The complimentary drinks in the room are such a welcoming idea and each night I had a little special treat delivered to the room.  Tescos and Sainsburys are out the front door, so handy.  The pool was amazing...can't wait to get back next year.  Fabulous staff, fabulous hotel.  ",5,2016,07,22
120,Is ok,"The room is clean as expected, awesome service, the reception is very lovely and polite, location is just average, not too bad, but not good as well. The bed is way tooooo soft, it cause neck pain and back pain the next morning. Complimentary drink should contain more selection",4,2016,07,22
120,"Almost perfect stay; I would give it a 4,5 if it was possible.","This was my third time in London and because of the minimal difference in rates between this hotel and for example Novotel a few minutes away, I chose this one. The service was EXCELLENT. The frontdesk attendants and the waiters in the restaurant. They try to do EVERYTHING to make you feel like a king/queen.

When I checked in and went to our rooms, I even got a call from the front-desk to ask if everything was fine and explain some things in the room. I really loved it. Also there was a fire-alarm-test on my third day and they called afterwards to tell that everything is ok (even though they announced it in advance). I spoke to three front-desk-attendants (Jan, Per and one more I don't know his name), and all three did their very best to help me out when I asked for it. My compliments.

The room was big, airconditioning was werking very well, five free bottles of drinks in the fridge, speaker connected to the tv in the bathroom, whatever you wished for was there.

The location was fine for me even though it's still a walk to the Southwark Undergroundstation. According to google-maps a 6 minutes-walk. before you reach the station I would say 10 minutes. But there's a direct busline from King's Cross/St Pancras (Int'l) to the hotel. Easier to travel with luggage.

The negative points:
*I checked-in one day before via internet and chose a room (corner with streetview). When I checked in I got another room with inner view (so I looked directly in another room when I opened my curtains). The frontdesk-attendant did try to look for other corner-rooms on other floors but there was none available.
*The room has a three-door-closet. but the single door was separate from the rest and it did took me a while to find it (untill I got the call from the front-desk)
*I had 2 (of the 4 days) dinner included but it was very unclear what I could order. The first night we got a special menu with 3 starters, 3 main courses and 3 deserts. The 2nd time we could order from the normal menu untill 25 pounds per person.
*The housekeepers didn't greet, not even when we greeted them first.
*The breakfast did have alot of choice but I did have better in for example H10 hotel in Berlin. I missed cheese for example and honey (love it in yoghurt and tea). The scrambled eggs looked like pourridge but you could always ask to cook it a bit dryer.
*I booked two rooms. In the other room there were only 5 bottles of water. My room had two bottles of water, 1 coke, 1 dietcoke and a bottle of orange juice. Why this difference?

After all the negative points were not that negative I wouldn't choose this hotel anymore. The only reason I wouldn't choose this hotel is if I can get a cheaper hotel in the same category (4/5 star) closer to the Underground in the neighbourhood.",4,2016,07,20
120,Excellent Diamond HHonors stay,"The Hilton Bankside is a hidden gem.  Well appointed behind Tate Modern and around the corner from Southwark station.  Short walk from London Bridge or Waterloo also.

I found from checking in to departure, my stay was excellent.  Staff very attentive working within a beautiful new hotel.  

Great large quiet rooms, provided an upgrade due to my Diamond status and was impressed with the executive lounge.  

Provided a choice for normal restaurant or lounge for breakfast - both are amazing and places other hotels to shame.  

Really loved the walk-in shower and the modern décor.  Happily stay again.",5,2016,07,20
120,Business Trip,"This is a 'new' (newly built) Hilton and is the concept so the front desk said that most new Hiltons will be built on. If so - bring it on! A great modern hotel, all the usual Hilton amenities but with a boutique like flair.",5,2016,07,20
120,Hilton Bankside,"Efficient, no-fuss service, modern, spacious, well appointed rooms, very comfortable, very convenient and reasonably priced. An excellent base for London business trips with all the amenities. Fully recommend and I will return.",5,2016,07,19
120,Amazing find tucked away on the south bank,"I stay regularly at Hilton hotels and this is something a little different in a very nice way!  It is in an ideal location for the south bank and is just off the main road. 

The reception area, dining room and bar are all very impressive and have a very modern decor - very All Saints.  The staff throughout the hotel are very helpful, always smiling and willing to assist.

Th room was very comfortable, spacious and clean.  The shower was excellent - my only comment is the lack of a mirror close to a plug socket to use a hair dryer.

I ate in the restaurant and it is one of the best meals I have ever had in a hotel - I rarely choose to eat in a hotel but arrived late and so glad I chose this option.  £21 for 3 amazing courses plus a glass of bubbly - can't beat that for value considering the quality in London.  See my review of Oxbo restaurant separately.  

Breakfast the next morning had everything you could want for and again all very fresh and high quality. 

Overall I would definitely recommend this hotel and will be staying again. ",5,2016,07,19
120,Perfect Location for Seeing Shows,"My friend and I were in London for 3 nights to see her son who was in Titus Adronicus at the Rose Theater. The Hilton London Bankside was only a 5-10 min walk to the Rose and other theaters. The staff were very friendly and helpful. We upgraded to the 7th floor which included breakfast, afternoon tea and evening cocktails. Also included was water, soda, juices and food items in our mini bar. The bed was very comfortable and the bathroom was large with a nice shower. Lighting could be controlled at bedside. Free WiFi. Nice lobby and bar. Great room service. Will definitely stay here again!",5,2016,07,18
120,Typifies what a good hotel should be.,"What a surprise, few hotels delight me the way this one did. Booking during a busy time in London, I selected this hotel for rate and vacancy, and did not have high expectations given its non descript exterior photos. After a four night stay, I am now an advocate and will definitely stay here when next in London.
Firstly, the area it is in is emerging as very cosmopolitan, with good eateries and shops popping up all around. Located just behind the Tate Modern, it's an easy walk to the City and the underground is very close for those going further.
The hotel interior design, reflects the industrial, eclectic style of Southwark, and marries this well with high end elegance.
Staff are exceptional, so proud of their hotel and so willing to help. The exec lounge was furnished beautifully, luxury and eclectic, it felt warm and welcoming, home, not like a typical hotel lounge.
Rooms are small, and can be dark due to small windows and location of building, but hard to fault. Very comfortable though, and the complimentary mini bar is classy.
Highly recommend.",4,2016,07,17
120,Excellent business hotel,The location close to the Shard is convienent. The staff very helpful and the room was excellent. It is close to the tube and historic locations should you have a one for business one for touring type of trip. ,5,2016,07,16
120,Perfect hospitality,"Arriving hot and tired, we felt very welcome by the lovely reception people. Our room was very clean and elegant modern, shades of grey with lovely wood paneling. The bathroom was very large, though this was an accessible room, I don't know if the bathrooms are all so large. 
We had no view at all, nice brick wall! Though we weren't planning to sit and look out, we were planning to explore!
The area is very nice and positioned perfectly for fans of the Tate Modern or the Globe theatre or perhaps just wandering all on the Thames Southbank.
Minor detail, we missed the signage on the front, so walked right past the first time.",5,2016,07,16
120,Whenever I'm in London...,"I have recently finished my 6th stay of the year so far at Hilton London Bankside, and I've already booked another for the upcoming week. Ahead of the likes of The Waldorf Hilton and Conrad London St James, this hotel is by far my hotel of choice in London.

This hotel is a new build, only completed October last year from memory and it clearly shows. Although the exterior isn't the most imposing, as soon as you walk in you feel the modern luxury of the hotel.

Service is one of the key areas where this hotel is by far superior to any other hotel I have experienced so far in London. Service is incredible. Check-in staff are active and friendly, and make you feel welcomed from the beginning. The same can be said for staff throughout the hotel. Whether it's the cleaning service or those within the restaurant, everyone seems to hold pride in making the hotel as friendly and welcoming as possible.

I've stayed in all bar one room categories (still waiting for a chance to experience the Penthouse Suite!) and can say all rooms are extremely modern and well-built. My only slight complaint is the desk in some of the executive rooms doesn't have the best lighting, but aside from that everything is brilliant. All rooms come with a free mini-bar, although alcoholic options are an additional charge. This includes nuts, jelly beans (!), soft drinks, water and fruit juices.

The restaurant is great, with buffet breakfast in the morning and a good food offering afterwards. The Distillery bar is also great - this bar specialises in gin and there really is a gin for everyone. I don't normally drink gin, but the bartender was able to recommend a gin I absolutely fell in love with.

For those with an executive room type, suites or HHonors Diamond membership there is the option to use the Executive Lounge for free. The exec lounge has a nice artificial fire in the middle which brings a great ambient feel to the lounge, alongside some good soft lighting in the evenings. Service is brilliant once again, and for those who prefer a quieter breakfast there is a smaller buffet selection than the restaurant but staff will happily bring over any additional food you'd like. Happy hour (free alcohol) is 6-8pm, and includes wines, beers, good selection of spirits and cava. Unfortunately I'm yet to have the chance to experience the afternoon tea offering here (joys of work!).

For those looking for somewhere they can work-out, there is a good ""business man"" gym available. Typical cardio equipment, i.e. treadmills, bikes and so on. There is a decent selection of weights, however not the most comprehensive if you happen to be into your weight training. Good enough for conditioning though. Further to that, there is a nice pool available to swim in although no sauna / steam room I'm afraid!

The nearest tube stations to the hotel are Southwark and London Bridge. It is around a 10 minute walk from Southwark station, and a bit further at around 15 minutes walk from London Bridge. If you plan to use London Bridge, take the exit towards Borough Market and walk down Southwark Street. Note London Bridge isn't the best if you have quite a lot of luggage (notably with this exit, there are quite a few stairs and I would advise using a different exit with escalators).

As mentioned at the start, my go-to hotel in London and that doesn't look like changing anytime soon. This hotel makes the travelling lifestyle a lot more enjoyable and relaxing.",5,2016,07,16
120,FANTASTIC,"My best friend booked us a weekend in London for my birthday, I've stayed in many Hilton hotels in the UK and around the world. This one was definitely one of the best! The staff were helpful, the hotel smelt wonderful. The bed was heavenly! Would 100% recommend this to anyone. Fab fab fab!",5,2016,07,16
120,Excellent ,"We had a 2 night stay here at the beginning of July, the room was spotless, very modern with a massive comfy bed. We didn't eat there so couldn't comment on the food, but it is in a great location and it's not too expensive for London. Well worth it. ",5,2016,07,16
120,Great stay,"We stayed here last night on business. Rooms very clean, good quality bedding and huge bath robes, complimentary soft drinks and water in the fridge. Bed was super comfy with fab quilt, again good quality. The whole place smelt so nice and all the staff I spoke to were really helpful and friendly. Would definitely stay here again.  ",5,2016,07,15
120,Great experience,"Had a night to stay in London after our week and a half trip around UK.  Choose this hotel based on proximity to where our daughter lives and was pleasantly surprised.  Feels more like a modern boutique hotel than a Hilton; very well appointed rooms, great public areas, helpful staff, excellent Executive lounge.  Only negative is for pure touristy stuff the location is just off the beaten path but Southwark underground station is couple of minutes walk.  Will definitely consider this location on the next trip back to London",5,2016,07,15
120,Do not use corrupted minicab service,Hotel was okay. Then when I wanted to use the traditional black taxi service. The conceige basically became very hostile. There is obviously a racket going on here at this hotel. I do not want a 2nd rate minicab service. London taxi was recommended to me to be the best and safest option. And for only £64 the cheapest out of the two. I had stopped by here to see a cousin. And was totally dismayed at the concierge attitude.,1,2016,07,15
120,Best Hotel In London,"This place is new and I can't recommend it enough. The staff are exceptionally detailed, the decor and rooms are to an incredible standard and prices match those of other London establishments but with so much better service! We stayed here over a weekend and arrived at 11am thinking we wouldn't be able to get checked in. WRONG! The customer services manager checked us in separately at his desk, invited us to join their Executive lounge for drinks and breakfast and checked us in there and then. Amazing service, beds are comfy in a quiet part of London and its a short walk away from Southbank with easy connections to Waterloo. Can't recommend it enough. The Blonde B blog",5,2016,07,14
120,A great weekend!,This hotel still has that feeling of 'new' about it. A lovely welcome from the Reception team particularly Andres & Liu. Room was nice and decorated in a modern minimalist style. My girlfriend was celebrating her birthday and we were given a special 'Birthday Dessert' to enjoy. We also got engaged to be married on the weekend and we had another surprise gift from the bar team to help celebrate this occasion and we really enjoyed the Cocktail making display from Matteus!! Breakfasts were excellent as expected from Hilton only one thing missing Prunes. The team in the executive lounge were also 'A1'. We also used the indoor pool. All in all this was a great choice of hotel for a double celebration weekend. Hilton is our brand of choice and the Hilton London Bankside did not let us down.,5,2016,07,14
120,Excellent service,"My husband and I took a weekend trip to London and we must say we was greeted with excellent customer service. Wonderful and clean modern rooms. Staff was very helpful throughout our stay. Not a busy area but close the places other spots. 
We would recommend you stay at this hotel on the trip to London. ",5,2016,07,13
120,Brilliant!,"Stayed in a King Bed One bedroom executive suite with 3 people, it is like 2 separate rooms, the beds are extremely comfortable also. The bathroom even has a speaker that plays the sound off your tv when it is on!! You also get free non alcoholic drinks from minibar and also some snacks like chocolate, sweets and peanuts (which was refilled by the time when we re entered our room). Also after every time we entered our room for the night, the beds would be remade with robes and slipped in place, and even our clothes folded. Down at the lobby check in and check out was seamless. The bar is amazing, they give free bowls of popcorn with every drink! In the executive lounge there was a delicious continental breakfast for free, and through out the day the coffee machine, water and soda drinks and some snacks were free to take whenever you want. Cannot describe how well the service in this hotel is from them calling a lift for you when they see you coming, to hand towels in bathrooms instead of a dryer to the lovely barmen in the distillery who recommend the best beer I've ever had and the best lemonade for my two teens, and also a big thanks to Pedro who managed to flag down a taxi off the streets for us on Sunday at 6 in the morning in time so we did not miss a bus to an event we were attending. The area is within relative walking distance to the business district of London, St Pauls Cathedral and the London Bridge district, really so many attractions within a 10-15 min walk! The area around the hotel is clean and for us felt safe to walk around from the tube station at 11 at night. Pay the extra bit for executive room, you will make the extra back in free food and drink you get! Cannot explain how good this hotel really is and I have in the past stayed in 6 other hotels in London, none come even close to this!",5,2016,07,13
120,"Beautiful Hotel, Service Exceptional and Location Perfect","This hotel is seriously good.  Loved the style and attention to detail and the bed was solo comfortable.  I loved the staff - very service orientated - all very friendly and helpful.  The minute we walked in the room, they followed up immediately with a call to check that we were happy with our room.  Concierge made some excellent recommendations for food and transportation.  Location was perfect for everything.  We went to the Wimbledon tennis one day and it was so convenient to go via Southwark Tube station and we were there within 20 mins and this was the average time when we went to the V&A museum as well. Highly recommend this hotel.  So why did I give it 4 stars and not 5 - two reasons - one was the club lounge variety of drink and food was a little skimpy when compared to other Hilton's we have stayed at and secondly the cost of laundry.  I considered having my dress ironed and instead as for an iron and ironing board as they would charge 22 pounds to iron a dress.  My husband also wanted to wash some smalls, well they wanted 5 pound per underwear, so we waiting till we got to the next place.  Other than this, I would definitely stay at this hotel again based on the location, the style and the service",4,2016,07,13
120,"Staff were amazing - could not do enough to ensure our stay was seemless, rooms luxuries, restuarant excellent","Felt like the staff were an extension of our own family home - which surprised us in such a big city - we didn't expect this. Staff made an effort to ensure we had everything we needed. Per Granstorm at reception was amazing!.He went above and beyond the all of duty, taking time to get to know us and to help us with our plans for the next day -  he took the time to map out the best routes to get about the city. Sarwar in the restaurant was also a stand out. Many thanks to all at Hilton London Bankside for making our stay so enjoyable. We will be back on day.",5,2016,07,12
120,By far the best Hotel in London,"I usually do not write long reviews about hotel but for Hilton Bankside I need to make an exception. I stayed at the Bankside for the first time in December 2015, which must have been shortly after the opened.

Which brings me to the first point: The hotel is brand new, not only refurbished but a new building, new rooms, new furniture and so on. This is a real advantage, especially in London where you have so many Hotels which have seen their best days long ago already. But the Bankside is not only new, you can see at so many details that it was planned and build with a lot of thought and an eye for details. The interior follows a clear design concept; the quality of the used materials is really high. Best is to describe it as industrial style, which is very en vogue all around London currently. Some people might not like that because it may look a bit to puristic or dark, I personally really like the style.

I usually stay in a King Deluxe or King Executive room. The rooms are quite big (especially for London) and again really well furbished. The beds are amazing, not only huge but for me personally have exactly the right firmness. The bathroom is again quite huge, some of them are with (walk in) shower, some with bathtub, others even have both. I prefer the shower, which comes with a rain shower head. Minibar includes complementary basic non alcoholic drinks in the deluxe room and a wider choice of non alcoholic drinks and chocolate bars in the executive room. As a regular guest I get special treats every 2nd day, which is either some desert, cheese, bottles of wine or similar. This just makes you feel even more welcome.
There is a very good gym in the basement, machines there are new and modern, personal TV on the cardio machines and it is except from peak hours not crowded at all. There is also a quite big swimming pool with Jacuzzi. Only downsides is that they do not have a Sauna.

The executive Lounge is the best I have been to at a Hilton (and any other hotel). They offer breakfast (which I don’t take there, because the general one is even better), afternoon tea (3pm-5pm) and evening snacks/drinks (6pm – 8pm). The lounge is open till 11pm. Afternoon tea is simply sensational. It can easily be compared with a afternoon tea you pay 30-40 pounds for anywhere else in London. And especially during the week there is almost nobody in the Lounge at that time. Evening snacks are really good as well, nice choice and high quality food. They usually have one warm dish, two different canapés, a variety of cold snacks and cheese. The service in the lounge is very friendly, focused and fast. Gaultier (the French manager, hope I spelled him correctly) is especially friendly, but also the girls around are really so helpful and friendly.

The breakfast is without doubt the best I ever had in a Hotel. Only fresh food, best quality and so much more choice compared to a standard breakfast. The guys doing the fresh eggs and pancakes are again really friendly and always open for a chat. After a few days they knew what I want and I never had to tell them again how I want my eggs cooked. Only negative point is the sometimes kind of slow service regarding coffee/tea at the table. Part of the staff there seems to be a bit unexperienced; they forget the order, bring the wrong stuff or take away your food while you are still eating. However that’s at least a good excuse to get some more!

One of the best parts of the Hotel is the Distillery bar. This bar is so much more than a usual hotel bar. First of all, the bar itself is really cool, they even have live music Thursday and Friday. But the best part are clearly the bar keepers Ricky and Mateo. These two Italian cousins raise this bar to a level which can match the best bars of London. Their cocktail mixing skills are unbelievable. Forget about “classic cocktails” what these two guys are doing is something totally different. They might get you a whiskey sour, but they will use ingredients that you did not think before and make your cocktail to perfection. Best thing is however letting them create something special for you. They completely read the taste of my girlfriend and mixed her one of the best cocktails she has ever had (several times actually). It is also really fun watching these two guys work, it is so much about the small details and they create such a great atmosphere at the bar as well. Again, one of the best bar experiences I ever had.

Last point I want to mention about the Bankside is the staff in general. I talked about the guys at the Lounge and the bar already, now I need to mention the reception staff. I stayed in a lot of Hotels in London already and somehow always had problems at one time or another with not that competent hotel staff. This is something that never happened to me at Bankside. First of all they are really friendly and polite, no matter how busy it is. They really try to help you solving any problem you have. I sometimes need to do a lot of different reservations, they always keep track of everything and I never had any problem there. I especially need to mention Kiana, HJ and Per, who have helped me at so many occasions already. Also coming back on a Monday after the weekend (or actually every evening), now it already feels like coming home if you see these guys at the counter and having a chat with them. Last two guys I want to mention are Anneke from guest relationship, who helped me as well with a lot of questions and Ben, who is our companies key account contact and did everything to make our stays more easy and pleasant. 
I realize that this review might sound a bit too positive. However after having stayed in Bankside for over half a year now every week, I really mean what I wrote. Especially this special staff makes it so much easier having to work far from home every week. I now for a fact that I will miss this hotel and the wonderful people I met there when my time in London will end.

In the meantime I am looking forward to spending a lot more weeks there!",5,2016,07,11
120,One night stay for boyfriends 21st,"Me and my boyfriend stayed here for a night for his 21st birthday. Staff were friendly and helpful. Decor is very modern and our room was so clean. Bed is king size too & really comfy

When I booked I asked the Hilton to make our stay extra special as it was my boyfriends 21st. We arrived to our room to find they had made him a small cake with happy birthday written in chocolate. I thought that this was a nice touch. 

Only downside was the tv having scrambled signal but as we were going out we didn't mind so much - might be a bit impractical for a longer stay.

Good facilities, I'd recommend using the gym and spa. The gym is 24/7 and pool is open till 10pm. ",5,2016,07,11
120,Amazing stay,"hotel quite well design and well presented. room comfortable and well designed location great. staff well presented, helpful and professional. breakfast amazing a lot of choices. close to the Tate museum and the river thame",5,2016,07,11
120,Perfect Stay,"I stayed at this hotel for my last few nights in London and it was perfect. The location was a short walk from Southwark station and TATE Modern. The room itself was amazing. Returning from my morning walk to get my bag, my bed was made up and the bathroom was completely cleaned. The bed was extremely comfortable and the room was quiet.

The staff were extremely helpful and friendly and definitely are the highlights of this hotel.",5,2016,07,10
120,Unfriendly reception staff,"I stayed at this hotel for a business function. My room was quiet and clean, the bed was very comfortable and the rainfall shower was a pleasant way to start the day. The food at breakfast was varied and of good quality. The only thing that let down the hotel was the unfriendly manner of the receptionist. I had a pre-booked room and had already given my credit card to pay for any extras when she asked me for proof of ID. I'm from the UK and like most people don't carry my driving licence or passport when travelling in the UK but she seemed very reluctant to give me my key card and I started my stay feeling unwelcome. The other staff I spoke to were much more friendly and helpful so perhaps I was just unlucky with this encounter but it would make me reluctant to choose this hotel again. ",3,2016,07,10
120,Perfect Location for Tate Modern. Boutique Feel.,"Hotel is less than a year old so everything is bang up to date, super clean and fresh. Lobby has an intimate luxurious feel and staff at check-in were friendly and efficient. Arrived an hour earlier than check in so offered a twin room which was available straight away. Room was spacious, shower excellent, bed really comfy, a great space to relax after sightseeing.Would stay again, loved it.",5,2016,07,09
120,Super quiet and a splendid staff!,"I recently stayed 3 nights at the Hilton London Bankside during a business trip  Aside from my one day excursion to see ""the tennis"" at Wimbledon, my stay at the hotel was the highlight of my trip.  The hotel staff is exceedingly polite, professional, and helpful.  I showed up at 8 am and was in a room by 9 am.  My room (3rd floor) and the hallways were very quiet.  The exercise room was large and had plenty of towels and bottles of water.  Finally, the executive lounge was beautiful, super comfortable, and had many snack/refreshment options.  This is a very nice hotel.",5,2016,07,06
120,Lovely visit,"We really enjoy this hotel, staff are friendly, welcoming and professional. It is also in v convenient location, within walking distance from London Bridge train station and close to restaurants and prominent London attractions",5,2016,07,06
120,"Clean, New...but far from Tube Stop and Major Sights","Almost everything great here after we got checked in.  We arrived very early (before 9am), and room was available.  We were staying 2 nights and had 2 separate reservations.  Originally, I had booked the first night with points since the rate was outrageous and then booked the 2nd night with a decent prepaid rate.  Later, the rate for the first night went down enough for me to cancel the reservation with points and rebook a flexible rate for the first night.  The room types were the same on all the reservations.  A few days before our arrival, the 1st room was upgraded to an executive room (we get automatic access to the lounge even if we aren’t upgraded due our Diamond status).  The day before, the room upgrade was taken away?  When we arrived and tried to check-in, the young lady wanted to see the credit card we had used for the prepayment.  We don’t carry all our cards when we travel and happened to have left this particular one at home.  She said she couldn’t accept our prepayment and would have to charge us again (and probably at the current rate?).  I raised a fuss and requested a manager.  I think his name was Alex, but I am not 100% sure.  He took us over to his desk and said he would work with us.  The card that had been used was a second card (other half’s name) on the same account that I held the primary card, which I had in my wallet.  He said to bring him something during the day from an on-line printout from my credit card statement that showed the payment and date posted.  I was able to do this and all was good from this point on.  He upgraded us to an Executive Room and combined the reservations so we didn’t have to move rooms.  It was only on the 2nd floor, but no complaints since we were tired and wanted a comfortable room rather than a high floor.  We had breakfast in the lounge one morning and in the restaurant the other one.  Both were good, but there were more selections in the restaurant.  The room was average size and had an area behind the bed with a desk, which we only used for the garbage pail.  The tv was ok but reset the first morning so I had to call the desk to access.  Technology?  The bathroom had a large shower but no tub so no luxury bath!  The room was quiet, and we slept fine when we first arrived, later for a nap, and also both nights.  The view was to a warehouse in the back of the hotel.  The area was still up and coming.  We had taken the Thameslink from Gatwick to Blackfriars and had made the short walk.  There were no real close tube stops, but we used the bus just around the corner to go to Covent Garden for the free walking tour and to also go with one change just after the river when we were heading to Paddington.  This hotel is new and is away from most of the sights.  The Tate Modern is nearby and then St. Paul’s is across the footbridge.  We attended there on the Sunday morning.  Everything was clean, the lounge was good except they only have alcohol (beer and wine only) from 6 until 8.  The first night we missed it since we had taken another nap as we were adjusting on our first day away from home.  We went the second night and were able to fill up on the hors d’oeuvres and had lots of wine so we didn’t have to go out for dinner.  We had also eaten enough at breakfast to skip lunch so we got by with no food expenses that day.  Most of the staff was very friendly and professional except for the young lady who gave us a difficult time at check-in.  You don’t treat your Diamond members that way.  Also, this was the only hotel in our 4 stays in the UK where they had to see our passports.  There were 2 ATMs just past the front door with no additional charges for my Capital One card!.  There was a valet service with the guys dressed in top hats, but we didn’t have a car nor did we ever use a taxi.  The mini-bar was complimentary for us also for non-alcoholic drinks and snacks as Diamond members-good touch but only one Diet Coke so I requested all Diet Cokes and no other soft drinks when they refilled the first day; no one refilled the second day!  Check out was painless, and we were only charged for night #1 since we had prepaid night #2.  I would definitely consider this hotel if I return to London.  It’s out of the way but quiet and safe.  Once you figure out the bus system and buy a card that has a maximum daily charge, you can get anywhere in the central city for about 7 pounds a day.  Next time, maybe we won’t arrive so early and will be given a higher floor with a more interesting and scenic view!",4,2016,07,05
120,Super great hotel!,"The hotel is strategically located. Close to the metro ri train station. Just a few minutes away and you have to open the doors of the hotel, where helpful staff kindly propose bear bags. Throughout the hotel foe emanates pleasant, refreshing, but very luxurious scent. Rooms clean flawlessly. Towel white to infinity ... Everything precisely arranged: Become, bathrobes, hygiene measures. Mini bar in soft drinks, snacks are free.",5,2016,07,05
120,Great experience at very reasonable price,"Stayed on a Saturday night in entry level room, admittedly we had a view of a wall but the room was fantastic and it was only gbp140.  Lobby and staff very good. Great location for Tate, borough market and globe theatre.  Indoor pool was good and quiet when we visited Sunday morning. ",5,2016,07,05
120,Bankside Hilton,"This is an excellent hotel in a great location! We wanted to go to the Globe and then walk to museums and other sightseeing options. The location of this hotel was the reason we chose it in the first place. However, the service was excellent the breakfasts we quite exceptional in choice and quality! It was easy to walk to the Globe and other theatres on the south bank. We also found it enjoyable to walk across the Thames and into central London. We walked to Convent Gardens and the theatre district, as well as the sights around Trafalgar Square.",5,2016,07,05
120,Lovely long weekend,"We really enjoyed this hotel and its location close to the Tate Modern and nice walk across the Millennium bridge to St Pauls and beyond.

The hotel felt brand new and furnishings and room all spik and span.

Eat breakfast twice in the main restaurant preferring to use local restaurants for dinner. Brekkie wa very good but there's local coffee shops that will suffice if you don't want a big meal.

Summary, a great hotel, convenient location with helpful staff. Best to shop around for discounts as can be expensive at times.",5,2016,07,05
120,Outstanding Stay,Outstanding hotel and awesome location. The staff was on point no matter what you needed. I highly recommend this hotel. It was centrally located and close to the underground system. The food quality and attention to detail was really awesome. ,5,2016,07,04
120,Very nice new hotel,I stayed here for one night and was very happy with the hotel. The hotel is very new and everything is in great condition. The common areas and the room/bathroom were in great shape. The room itself was very small compared to others in the area. We had breakfast at the hotel one morning and the service and food were both excellent. I would stay here again if looking for something in this area.,4,2016,07,04
120,Great first visit,As the Conrad was fully booked we thought we would try the Hilton Bankside for a change. It is super convenient for the Tate Modern and Shakespeare's Globe and 20 minutes walk to the National Theatre (or £7/£8 by taxi). Check in was great with the charming Hannah who upsold us a suite for an extra £20 (we already had a free upgrade to an executive room due to my Diamond Status). Hannah had to check with her manager if we could use the executive lounge after checkout and as this was what we were normally used to at the Conrad he/she said this would be OK although we had to be let in by Hannah rather than have a key programmed. The suite on the 7th floor had a small bedroom and lounge but was very nice - very new and modern with a shower and bath. We had the choice of breakfast in the restaurant or Executive lounge (Conrad has recently changed this to continental breakfast only in the restaurant.) and afternoon tea and evening drinks and canapés in the lounge were very good - plenty of shrimp and smoked salmon but only one hot offering. The lounge staff were excellent - very engaging. The heated pool is a bonus although the nearest underground station is 15 minutes walk. Overall we very much enjoyed our stay and would not hesitate to stay again.,5,2016,07,04
120,"The up-charges are coming, the up-charges are coming!","Never again Hilton Bankside. Never again Hilton. Literally thousands of hotel nights over my career and personal travel and Hilton Bankside takes the prize for the most off putting check-in and departure ever. 

Checkin is 3PM. We knew that. But like many folks arriving from the States, we got in early - about 1:30. We asked if a room was available. Answer: ""the room YOU reserved will not be available until three, but I can upgrade to a room available now."" (For what amounted to a 40% premium over what we had reserved.) Now even if it was true - it wasn't - that no other rooms were available - couldn't your first sentence be something other than a crass grab for money? 

It continued. We declined the upgrade. Next sentence: ""YOUR rates doesn't include breakfast, I can upgrade you to a rate that does"". (About a 25% premium) Again, we knew that and didn't book it because we had other plans. We declined. 

About that ""no rooms available""... as I said I travel a lot and, sure, on a weekend no rooms by 1:30 is possible (late risers, etc.), but on a Friday - when business travelers depart early and in mass - seemed unlikely. When it became clear we weren't going to bite on the 'upgrades' - OUR room could be available in 30 minutes. When challenged,  and it was clear we were going to remain visible in the lobby, miraculously, a room was found to be immediately available. Hmmm.

Now the departure. The breakfast. We decided to have a quick breakfast after all before leaving. Wasn't in our rate (we were warned!) and we had no interest in the 40GBP buffet - just looking for coffee, toast, maybe an egg. We were seated and promptly ignored. Completely. Could not waive anyone down. Complaint to the hostess was met with blank stares. After 20 minutes - we left hungry. And angry. 

Hilton - there are too many options to live with this nonsense. Cutting up the HHonors card as I write this.

Otherwise - a good location if you're going to the Tate Modern or Burrough Market. Not much else to recommend it. View is of a brick wall. Not an interesting Victorian brick wall, mind you, just a massive slab of dull a meter from the glass.",2,2016,07,04
120,"Nice hotel, fine location, unhelpful staff","At first I got for some reason an accessible room and already at check in I was offered to upgrade the room for 50£ A Night!!! After i saw the room and I ask to switch rooms I was denied  cause there were no vacancies. Only after a long argue a room was surprisingly found.
The room was nice and comfortable, fair gym and nice indoor pool.
The biggest disadvantage are the rooms facing a small courtyard which from it is even hard to tell how the weather is.
Breakfast was generous nice and delicious.
The hotel area is fine, few steps from Tate modern and the southbank, tube station is also nearby.",3,2016,07,03
120,Wonderful hotel,This hotel is simply superb. The customer service is sublime and the food is wonderful. Splash out and get a suite to get access to the exec lounge - the best I've ever been in and their bottomless brunch is delicious! ,5,2016,07,03
120,Excellent hotel!!!,"Top notch rooms and service! Front desk staff were very warm and welcoming upon check-in. Rooms were very modern, spacious and most importantly, clean. The hotel seemed recently built and had a very cozy feel. Although there aren't many things to do immediately around the area, the tube is a 5 minute walk away. Small convenience stores are a minute away if you need something fast. Don't hesitate booking this hotel on your next trip!",5,2016,07,03
120,"Large room, good location","Visited for one night, booked standard room. Pleasantly surprised by the size of the room for central London, super king bed and walk in shower. Very modern and nice extra touches such as complimentary water, soft drinks, nuts and sweets in fridge. Very clean. Good location easy walk to borough market, and central London. Despite good location, no noise at night. ",5,2016,07,03
120,Amazing services!,"We had an execellent stay to the Hilton London Bankside, it's located near to the center and easily accessible for all the attraction of London.
The staff were very friendly, services absolutely perfect for us. I ordered a birthday cake in the room for welcoming ( was our anniversary:) ) and they were very responsive. Thank you so much!
The pool was clean and very nice but little cold for me :)
Mini-bar complementary and water as well, nonalcoholic products. Here I ate the best eggs Benedic ever! Overall amazing!
I highly recommend this hotel!
Thank you!",5,2016,07,02
120,Beautiful brand new hotel,"Everything in and around this hotel is beautiful.  The decor is minimal and masculine in the bedrooms, warm and cosy in the lobby and bar, and modern and comfy in the restaurant.  The staff were lovely and could not be more welcoming or helpful.  Breakfast was extensive - the pastry buffet had to be seen to be believed - not for dieters.  We will be going back.  Fab towels - massive and super absorbent.  Highly recommended.",5,2016,07,02
120,Almost,"This is a nicely designed hotel. Rooms are well appointed (though some have only narrow windows which makes them kinda gloomy - a manager kindly moved me upon request after arrival). They have good closets and handsome baths. On my second stay here, however, the details were much less well attended to. The room was missing different items each day. One day it was a bathmat. One day it was the breakfast order card. Which I am glad I asked for, as the next day when I took business contacts to breakfast in the restaurant it was an unmitigated disaster, prompting one of my guests to say it reminded him of an episode of Fawlty Towers. The manager was apologetic but defensive, putting it down to a shortage of experienced staff. (British railway managers say that a lot, too.) Upon further repeated protest at checkout and in a reply to their followup email, management finally refunded the charges.",4,2016,07,02
120,Fantastic hotel with exceptional staff,"One night in to our two night stay and I have nothing but praise for this wonderful hotel in one of my favourite locations in London.

The rooms, like the hotel itself are quite simply beautifully finished. The bar, restaurant and lounge are all very welcoming, and I am sorely tempted to spend much more time inside the hotel than out and about in London as it all feels very cool, relaxed and surprisingly peaceful given it's proximity to buzzing borough market and the lively south bank.

The hotel is blessed with a team of some of the friendliest and most helpful staff I have ever come across. Nothing is too much trouble and they truly are an absolute asset to the hotel.

I cannot fault anything here.. I love it and I will definitely be back. I will also definitely recommend this hotel to friends and family looking for a central, friendly and very comfortable place to relax in London.",5,2016,07,01
120,Great location not great service,"the first night was great, but then went downhill after that, ironing board and things I got out in a rush were not put away, dirty towels on the floor were thrown onto the ironing board and not put away or new ones put in the room. Water was no replenished in the minibar - very disappointing first experience",3,2016,06,30
120,Birthday Weekend,"The Hilton Bankside is an outstanding hotel.
Our stay was amazing..  Definitely five star hotel with five star staff. 
Warm and friendly welcome on arrival . 
The rooms spacious and very comfortable.
 We mentioned on arrival that it was my husbands birthday and came in one night to fine a cake had been left with a lovely note. X ",5,2016,06,30
120,Luxury and impeccable service,"So happy we chose this hotel! Every staff member was exceptional. Our suite was luxurious and quiet and we chose the club level which included a fantastic breakfast and drinks and appetizers in the evening. Close to the Tate Modern and Borough Market. 
",5,2016,06,30
120,As expected top class stay,"Hotel carries the new look Hilton look which is contemporary. Very clean and tidy. Had an excellent stay. Not very far from attractions such as Shard, Oxo tower etc
For £40 you can make use of valet parking
Drinks slightly expensive but you would expect that in Hilton in London. 
Trip was birthday treat for my partner. Not sure how but staff found out and they had a very nice cake specially made for her delivered to our room. Thank you guys because you made her day even more special 
And yes you get 5 star treatment at this premium 5 star hotel. ",5,2016,06,29
120,Rare Gem in London,"Finding a good value hotel in London is not easy. If you're looking around the 200USD a night mark then you're usually saddled with a lot of very average options. But this new Hilton seems to tick all the right boxes - and given the fairly high tripadvisor rating, the good value rates may not remain for long.

Pros:
- Design - While it still feels like a business hotel, the new design here is a little bolder and more interesting than Hiltons of the past. Rooms feel fairly spacious (for London), the rain-showers are excellent and common areas are pleasant to spend time in.
- Service - Competent, polite and helpful throughout.
- Value - as mentioned before, the rates here are excellent given the relative quality.

Cons:
- I am told that some rooms have a view only of the interior of the hotel - I find this depressing personally and would try to avoid staying in one
- Location - I am not a big fan of the south side of the river and there isn't a lot going on in the immediate vicinity of this hotel. You will probably need to get the Tube/Uber across the river or to nearby Bermondsey for something interesting. That said, you do have the Tate Modern a stone's throw away from the hotel which will be useful for those who want to visit the gallery.",5,2016,06,29
120,Wonderful hotel,"We used points to stay here for a few nights while in London.  It was not a very far walk from a tube station and there were two grocery stores close, one right next door and one across the street.  The room had a small under the counter refrigerator so that was handy.  With status with HIlton the breakfast buffet was included which was invaluable.  There was a huge variety of foods to choose from.  The location was great for getting around the city either walking or using the tube.  I would highly recommend this hotel.",5,2016,06,28
120,A little luxury,"This was our first stay at the Hilton Bankside, and we loved it!   From the moment we entered we knew that we had made a great choice for our weekend. The entrance area is gracious and the greeting at the front desk was warm and friendly. In our room we appreciated the bowl of fresh strawberries, the water in the chiller unit and the extra toiletries in the shower. All little touches that make a difference. Refreshments in the executive lounge were plentiful and the breakfast was a knockout. Lots of variety and all beautifully presented.
Service throughout our stay was friendly and prompt.
We have already booked our next stay! Highly recommended.",5,2016,06,28
120,Can't fault it !,"We had a fabulous stay, room was spacious and bathroom couldn't be faulted. 
Warm welcome from a delightful Anthony.
Great location for the Globe, Tate, Bourough market. 
Loads of place eat and drink within a few minutes walk.",5,2016,06,27
120,Very Comfortable and Good Location,"This is a new Hilton hotel I had not stayed at before.  I usually stay at the Hilton Tower Bridge as it is very close to my meeting place, but it was fully booked. This was the next nearest suitable hotel so I gave it a go.  It is modern, clean, the staff were very smart and the room was very comfortable and well kitted out.  The shower was one of the best I've had in a hotel.  The breakfast was very pricey - £20 - so I gave it a miss and had a wonderful full English at a nearby eatery for less that half the cost in the hotel.",4,2016,06,27
120,Superb Stay,"Just returned from a 2 night stay at the Hilton Bankside. This was our first stay at the hotel and from the moment we arrived it was a memorable stay. The hotel has a great restaurant and bar. We had breakfast, lunch and dinner during our stay and every meal was excellent. The staff were friendly and very efficient. The room was perfect and very well appointed. We stayed in a deluxe room with a king size bed which was extremely comfortable. The bathroom was spotless and I liked the choice between the conventional shower and the rainfall shower. Although busy the atmosphere in the hotel was quiet and sedate. It is perfectly located for Tate Modern, Shakespeare's Globe, Borough Market and access to the north side of the river via the Millennium Bridge. Bankside is quite simply the best Hilton I have ever stayed in. Looking forward to our next stay. ",5,2016,06,26
120,"New, modern, stylish","We booked this hotel at the last minute when we decided to stay overnight in London.  It is just 2 minutes from Tate Modern and the South Bank and seemed to be part of a more general re-development of that part of the city. There are several other new hotels in the vicinity.  It's an easy 10 minute walk from London Bridge station. The lobby is impressive with funky furniture and lectern stations for check in staff.  We arrived earlier than check in, did the paperwork then left our luggage while we went off to explore.   We were offered an upgrade for £25 which would have included an executive lounge area for afternoon snacks, drinks and breakfast, but since we had other plans we turned it down.  When we did return at 11pm our luggage had been taken to our room - a nice touch.  It is a new hotel (staff said 7 months opened) and everywhere feels like a show house. Decor is contemporary with elaborate lamps, a ceramic fox on the wall (not sure about that!), large tv, robes, slippers, kettle and an empty fridge drawer.  Perhaps the fridge should have been filled ? Bathroom was lovely, but just a shower, if we'd been staying longer I'd have asked for a bath - it was not even mentioned at check in. We had a drink in the bar, which was modern and friendly.  I'm aware they also have a pool, but I didn't use it. A really lovely hotel which I anticipate we will definitely visit again.  ",4,2016,06,26
120,great Hotel during business trip in London,"Location is great, just behind the Tate museum, near Blackfriars tube station to the left, the bridge of London to the right.
Employee at the front desk was extremely professional and attentive. Fast check in and all instructions given about the room. Spotless  clean room with amenities, hair dryer, rob, umbrella and tea / coffee set. The more important for a traveler in London: Universal connection for your electronic devises. Priceless... Fast internet connection-
Unusually big room for London standards.
Nice swimming pool that I will use in my next visit. Complete small gym with towels and water bottles for free. I did not got breakfast as I rather go running in the early morning by the Thamesis and grab a bit on my way to the hotel. Highly recommended.",5,2016,06,26
120,Fabulous Hotel,"Stayed Thursday night for our second visit to this stunning hotel. Jan on check in & out was efficient & very friendly. We had a suite which was amazing. Spacious, super comfy beds & massive shower. The Distillery bar is fantastic - an amazing range of gins. Excellent overall.",5,2016,06,25
120,Great location. Great atmosphere,"I will be back. One of the best Hilton's in London for sure, and an outstanding stay altogether. Top for the location, decoration, food with vegan options at all meals. Awesome service and team too. Great.",5,2016,06,25
120,Not your London hotel standard - much better,"We are used to the small, old and the carpet smelling room in London, unless you have £300 or more to spend per night! This hotel is different. The reception is welcoming and nicely designed. The staff were friendly. The most important thing are the rooms. My room was new, spacious, and nicely furnished! A very good surprise for a central location! The rate was great compared to the room and service I received!  It is 10 min walk to the river! I would stay again and I would recommend others to stay.",5,2016,06,24
120,Bit disappointed ,"This is our third or fourth stay since it opened recently. It's got great rooms and is chic and modern. As it's still building up its customers it's reasonably priced too. This time checkin and out were both a real let down after being really good previously. We had an officious lady who wanted ID to get into our Bookings.com booked room, tried to charge £25 for an upgrade she gave us anyway, and was then insistent on all the particular credit cards and ID we had to bring next time. The queue to check out the next day was really bad too. It's not a bad location but they need to wake up, there are many hotels in London and good customer service is why hotels build loyalty.",4,2016,06,24
120,Wouldn't stay there again,"Hotel was good in general. No way to get ready in the room, only mirror available had no plug. Service not very good during the conference and couldn't find a seat in the restaurant. Other than this the room was clean, facilities were good and the breakfast was good.",3,2016,06,23
120,Excellent,Just loved this hotel. The bed was amazing and the room very very nice even though we did'nt have the view. You should really try the restaurant for a steak for dinner and grap a drink in the bar later. Only minus: they forgot to fill the mini bar. Not much more to say than EXCELLENT,5,2016,06,22
120,"Fabulous hotel, great location.","Stayed here for a weekend break, fabulous location in Southwark, close to the Tate, plenty of bars & restaurants nearby...and the lobby smells lovely!!

Feels like a 5star hotel, great service and big well laid out rooms with massive showers. 
If you stay, try the fantastic cocktails in the bar, great waiters who take the time to both explain the drink (if asked) and make it with care and attention. 
Will definitely stay were again.",5,2016,06,22
120,Good choice,Standard as expected from a Hilton Hotel. Staff were great - genuinely friendly & helpful.  Not cheap - but given the location that's to be expected. Was able to use some Tesco Vouchers to help towards the cost.,4,2016,06,21
120,Overnight Stay in London,"This hotel is in an excellent location for visiting the Southbank, The Globe Theatre and Borough Market. Lots of good restaurant and small café near by. The hotel is also within walking distance to the Tate Modern. Great Hotel would definitely stay there again and would happily recommend it.",5,2016,06,21
120,Top Class,"Just finished an eight night stay at the Hilton Bankside and was very impressed. From check in to check out the staff were friendly and helpful. Spacious room and well designed bathroom. We have not stayed in this part of London before but really appreciated the hotel's proximity to attractions such as the Tate Modern and Borough Markets. Nice walk across the Millennium Bridge to St Paul's. 
Due to other commitments only got to visit the Executive Lounge twice. Nice space with good selection of drinks and canapés. The breakfast in Oxbo was excellent and the staff were great. Will stay here again.",5,2016,06,21
120,Great Experience,"My family and I stayed at this hotel for the second time for a week.  One might say i am a stickler for hotels and their customer service.  This hotel went above and beyond on customer service. Anytime I had a problem with something which usually happens during a hotel stay, they went above and beyond to solve the problem.  Nothing was too big or too little.  Besides having excellent customer service, it is in a great location with plenty of shops and walking distance to the Thames river. Overall we had a great stay. And I almost forgot to add the great executive lounge and very clean and modern rooms!",5,2016,06,21
120,Take a torch,"The architect and interior designer got it completely wrong at this Hilton. A combination of tiny windows, dark grey decor, and mood lighting in the rooms makes you feel like a mole with rickets.
Reception and the restaurant are too dark too.
We've stayed at lots of Hiltons in the UK, but this one just doesn't tick the right boxes.
Great location though, and most staff polite and helpful.",3,2016,06,21
120,Another great stay at the #1 hotel in London in my opinion!,"I am a regular at this Hilton and I have to say it's the best Hilton I have stayed in of all my worldly travels. 

Why do I say this, because the staff care, and whether you are a regular or a once off visitor they treat you with the same warm welcome and want you to have a good stay.

This time I was lucky enough to have secured the newly opened penthouse - oh my god it is beautiful! Total urban chic with floor to ceiling windows, outside terrace with seating, fully equipped kitchen area, with fridge full of goodies that are replaced daily! Comfy lounge area with hidden tv and the. Off into the massive bedroom with super king bed, seating area, hidden bathroom and walk in wardrobe! 

The bathroom is marble throughout with separate bath tub area and then walk in shower/wet area.

The executive lounge is fantastic, again with a lovely team who make sure you're looked after. A continental breakfast is served each morning in the lounge, with afternoon tea and evening drinks and canapés also offered in a relaxed yet urban environment.

Oxbo has a wider variety of breakfast offering and there bottomless Sunday lunch is to die for! I have yet to try their Saturday brunch but this looks equally as good from the menus I have seen.

The distillery is a great bar with some amazing cocktails, and very popular with the local office workers as well as residents and is lively and buzzy! Do not walk past this place! 

Finally the hidden gem is the basement pool and gym an oasis of calm, and there's even a jacuzzi as well!

Many thanks as always to all of the staff, from the great front desk team (Per, Anthony, Anais, Eki, Hannah and Daksha), the Concierge team who are always super helpful, the Executive lounge team and of course the housekeeping crew who keep the rooms looking so lovely.

The hotel is superbly located for the Tate Modern, St Pauls, The Globe, Tower Bridge and the Tower of London and is five minutes walk from Blackfriars Railway Station and Southwark Jubilee Line Underground Station. It is also on the RV1 bus route which will get you to the London Eye, Southbank and Covent Garden in no time at all.

Finally, compared to prices of hotels on Piccadilly, The Strand, Seven Dials this hotel is superbly priced. Having stayed at other leading hotels of the world, this hotel beats them hands down.

Cannot wait to return....which will be very soon! Give this hotel a try you will not regret it! ",5,2016,06,20
120,"Excellent hotel, good location, good value","We stayed here for two nights during June .  Its a 5-7 minute walk to the Southwark Tube station and fairly easy to find from there.

Its about a minute walk to the Tate Modern and not far to St Pauls Cathedral.  Its a great location and proved to be very good value for money.

The staff were all first class and very helpful.

We didn't eat at the hotel so don't know about the food.  There is a small Sainsbury's, Tesco Metro and Co-op all within 100 metres which could help you out for breakfast etc.

We would definately stay here again.",4,2016,06,20
120,"Lovely hotel, however the service REALLY does let it down","On visiting London last weekend, we were excited by the prospect of staying the lovely new Hilton Bankside in Central London. On arrival, it looked very impressive and our room was equally so. No complaints here. However, after having such a lovely day sightseeing and shopping in London my partner and I got changed to go out for the evening and thought it would be nice to have a cocktail in the hotel before we hit the town. On arriving downstairs, we noticed the bar was closed. A lady stood outside told us that this was for a private event, however said not to worry as it would not be a problem getting a drink in the restaurant. On arriving in the restaurant, the hostess went to hand us a menu. When we told her we didn't want to eat, she said we couldn't go in. I explained what we had been told, and very rudely she said ""this is what my supervisor says"". I therefore asked to speak to the supervisor and with a smirk on her face she picked up the phone. I then proceeded to reception and asked to see someone in charge. A gentleman approached me and said that it should be no problem to have a drink in the restaurant and walked back over to speak to the hostess. I could see him arguing with her and then eventually he summoned us over. He showed us over to a table where we were eventually served. I could of perhaps understood it being an issue if the restaurant was actually busy, however I think there were four or five tables occupied (and it's a huge restaurant!). The hostess proceeded to stare at us whilst talking to her colleagues about us and what we hoped would be a pleasant drink in the bar after a fabulous day in London, ended up putting a bit of a downer on our weekend. We complained at reception on check out and the man on the desk was apologetic. We did also receive an email. However, the email talked about us ""misinterpreting"" the hostess - as if we were lying??? We were so cross we sent an email and suggested that they should refund our cocktails as a kind gesture, and they refused, saying their service was of the highest standard. Well I'm sorry Hilton Bankside, not on this occasion. I would highly recommend that you inform your guests when the bar is closed for private events and that you improve the communication between your operations manager and restaurant manager. I'm shocked at this poor service and genuinely hope other guests don't experience it.",1,2016,06,19
120,Great stay ,Very good stay from start to finish. Food and service was excellent and the staff were very friendly. Nothing was too much trouble and they were happy to help on every occasion. We had the Bulls head for 2 in the restaurant and it was amazing. Breakfast also very good.,5,2016,06,19
120,Family reunion,"Used hotel as base for weekend family gathering. Comfortable rooms, good service, attentive staff and a handy location for our plans. The pool is a reasonable size and wasn't busy when we used it which was a result!",4,2016,06,19
120,American style standards in London!,"English hotels don't usually live up to my experience of hotels I've stayed at in the USA. Hilton Bankside is an exception to that! The lobby is beautiful, smells great and is full of staff who are friendly and helpful. 

We upgraded to a one bedroom suite which was very nice; with a separate living area, fab bathroom, nice king size bedroom and a guest WC. The room is decorated in dark tones which is very funky but can make it difficult to get good light to put on make up etc. There is also a distinct lack of mirrors in the bedroom area (the one provided in the dressing table is too low to be used) which meant that I had to dry my hair using a mirrored wardrobe door. Not ideal but, not really a problem. There are plenty of plug sockets and amenities provided for your stay. 

There were a few minor niggles during our stay - the mini bar is free (with the exception of alcohol) but wasn't replenished. We had a turn down service on one night but not on the other. We couldn't get the coffee machine in the room to work but didn't pursue this as we just visited the executive lounge to get coffee. We also had to return to reception on our second day to provide credit card details again despite having done this at check in. The staff member, whilst pleasant, didn't seem too fussed with the failure in the process which caused a little annoyance. None of these issues were serious but were all a little bit of a let down.

The executive lounge was a very nice perk. It's a nicely laid out area with plenty of snacks available throughout the day and  friendly staff on hand to provide assistance. 

We didn't use the restaurant, bar, gym or pool but really liked the location of the hotel which is 5 minutes from the Tate Modern and about the same from Southwark tube station. 

I'd definitely stay here again as this Hilton appears to be striving for something better than the usual English standards of hotels. We'll be back!",5,2016,06,18
120,Great hotel!!!!!!!,"Clean, amazing bar and restaurant, particularly the cocktail waiter (I think his name was Marcella), cannot fault our stay. Nice room with great complimentary amenities, just great recommend to anyone
Only came up from Surrey for one night would do again",5,2016,06,18
120,"Beautiful, ideal location comfy beds!","This hotel is amazing.  We got lucky as our employer somehow ended up putting us here.  London bankside has spacious, quite rooms with very comfortable beds, the breakfast is very yummy, there are speakers in the bathroom that connect to the TV to. (Which you can connect to the interet on your TV, so nice.)  Lovely.",5,2016,06,18
120,Great Staff,"We stayed here for seven days and I have no complaints. The staff was exceptionally friendly and the room was adequate. If you're traveling from the US, they do have a universal converter so no need to really buy one unless you have a lot of electronics to charge. We had 3 phones and a couple of games so we had to take turns but it worked out for us. My sons laptop has the three prong chargers and that didn't work so if you have that then you need to buy the converter.
I didn't use the bar or eat at the restaurant but it's located in a business area and it's not a far walk to the Southwark tube station or Waterloo… Uber is alway in the vicinity and if you like walking you can walk to the London Eye and the other attractions in that area like the Aquarium, Shrek's Adventure, London Dungeon etc.
Borough Market is close by and the Tate Museum. Went all over on our own and we had a great time. If we do go back to London, I would chose another location only for variety but I have no problem with this one. 
The only issue I had is the inconsistency of housekeeping, there were a couple of days the room wasn't cleaned and when it was cleaned, there was about two days where the garbage wasn't taken out and some scarcity with towels for three people; not a big deal to me though.
Oh I had no view to speak of and the room was darker than I would like but we were out so much I just dealt with it.
Finally, I had a junior suite so there was free wifi. Not sure if it was because of the suite or the hilton honors membership. That was a plus
I would recommend especially if you're on business.",4,2016,06,18
120,Overnight stay,"Had a relaxing time with my friends. The hotel is clean, staff quite friendly. The rooms are big with comfortable beds. Located close to tube station. Nice restaurants within walkable distance. Restaurant in the hotel does not cater to vegetarian diet( not a lot of choice)!",4,2016,06,18
120,Luxury stay,Top class hotel. The staff were amazing as were the rooms and food. I would recommend to stay in this hotel to anyone. Great location and has everything you need wether staying for business or leisure.,5,2016,06,18
120,"Nice hotel, great bar, rooms good but not exceptional","We enjoyed our stay here, but perhaps not as much as others. The bar and restaurant are great: awesome selection of drinks and food of a great caliber. Decor in the communal areas is great and the pool itself is small but very quaint. Nice, if sparse gym but it does have crucial equipment so you can have a full workout. Somewhat ironically, the room was the least impressive part of the experience. It's clean and modern but feel vey clinical. It's also darkly fashioned in brown and greys: personally I'd have liked some colour to add character.

Staff were nice though, although did ignore requests and similar that I made letting them it was my wife's birthday. Not even an acknowledgment...",4,2016,06,17
120,Luxury hotel with smiling staff and excellent breakfast,"Stayed for one night. Very pleasant. Room was nice, bed big and sleep good. The staff was very attentive and friendly, and helped in every way. Breakfast was super with great selection and many good tastes. There is a nice gym and a pool in the basement. Used this for a morning swim. Will come back, despite the price being a bit high.",5,2016,06,17
120,Best hotel I have ever stayed at,"Went to London for a short break with my partner so we choose this hotel and we are glad that we did.
We checked in on the 10/06/16 and the staff where so welcoming and friendly they made me feel right at home. They helped with the suitcase when we arrived and took it to our room.
The room we had was so nice bed was amazingly comfy, the bathroom was beautiful and the rain shower was so nice. They have a switch in the bathroom which lets you listen to the tv while your in there. Through out our stay the staff were fantastic everyone single staff member I seen would greet us.
The breakfast there is amazing there is so much choice from your full English to waffles and pancakes.
We ordered room service on the last night there it was amazing I would recommend the chocolate fudge brownie sundae.
Overall experience was amazing will definitely go back there again.",5,2016,06,17
120,great bar with amazing barman,Ricky the best barman rocks! best cocktails in town!! top location in the heart of london. you have to try the spicy mezcal cocktail custom edition by ricky! firthermore i recommend the gin mare special edition by ricky cocktails that just tastes amazing!,5,2016,06,16
120,Good stay,"Very good stay and staffs are nice. The location is far from station. A free shuttle would be helpful. Breakfast was excellent. If dinner buffet is provided, I would definitely try it. Not all rooms with bathtub. ",5,2016,06,16
120,I wish there were more stars to give this hotel,We arrived at the Hilton Bankside exhausted and bedraggled. The staff leapt into action taking us right into the executive lounge for refreshments assuring us that when we were feeling refreshed our room would be ready and our luggage delivered to it. That was just the first five minutes and it got just better and better. I can not recommend the Hilton Bankside too highly. I don't care what it costs. If I am in London again this is where I will stay.,5,2016,06,15
120,"Excellent location, Highly Recommended","Lovely hotel situated approximately 5-7 minute walk away from Southwark station. Best of all, when you travel all the way from Heathrow on tube - you don't have to carry your suitcase over the stairs (unlike some tube stations). Other than that, the hotel is also within reasonable walking distance (i.e. under 20 minutes) to - Borough market, Shakespare globe, bankside, waterloo etc.

We've got ourselves booked into a deluxe twin room. The decor inside the room is quite modern and I love the bright bathrooms and the spacious shower. Great facilities (especially the pool).

I'll certainly consider coming back to the hotel again when I next visit London.",5,2016,06,14
120,Always an amazing experience,"I have been coming here since the hotel opened last year and love the place.  My only complaint is that word is getting out and it's getting busy!  Great rooms, friendly and attentive service and a great lounge - love it!  Location is great too for south bank, Tate modern and tube.  Really can't fault it.",5,2016,06,14
120,Excellent,"Excellent Facilities, Loved the Stay last weekend.

I have been visiting this hotel on and off and its one of our favouries in the area, I have visited it 4 times over the last month and its excellent, very friendly staff and accommodating, loved the Pool and the gym.

Only one issue in the last weekend, was working till 4 am and the alarm system went off due to some issue in the kitchen so woken like I was in a spaceship with all the sounds and lights and announcement but the friendly staff made me happy with the experience anyways.",4,2016,06,13
120,Highly recommended,"Wonderful stay made special by the absolutely outstanding service. Staff were so helpful. The whole stay made the weekend treat for my Mum's birthday treat truly memorable! Breakfast was amazing, and location was perfect.",5,2016,06,12
120,Modern,This hotel has a very modern feel to it. The hotel is a short walk to the nearest tube station. We ordered room service on the first night since our flight was in late. The burgers there were amazing!,5,2016,06,12
120,Lovely and quiet ,"Lovely and quiet. Great location,  close enough to everything, but quiet neighbourhood. Always nice when water and softdrinks in the minibar are comlementary. Pool and fitness area are fine. Staff very friendly. ",4,2016,06,11
120,Amazing!,"Went here for a one night getaway to London, absolutely beautiful hotel, massive room, extremely clean. We had access to an extra lounge which had canapés and drinks which was also lovely. Breakfast was extensive, and I would highly reccomend the granola which is homemade at the hotel. Also the swimming pool was empty most of the time meaning we had a pool to ourselves which was just incredible. Complete good value luxury hotel experience.",5,2016,06,11
120,My best Hilton hotel. By a country mile!,"I absolutely loved this hotel.  It's one of ten latest Hilton hotels. The art is good. The finishes are lovely. I really liked the wooden finished - modern and not old school. The rooms are well laid out. Sadly, I stayed here for a night. There is live acoustic music at the bar at night and at the restaurant over brunch. The rooms on 7th floor are good. They have a view. They are big too and most of all, quiet. The staff is good. The restaurant has lovely and well-dressed people who are out to have a good outing either for drinks or a meal, like the Sunday brunch. I really loved it. The prices are fairly reasonable (by London standards). I loved it so much that I didn't want to leave. It absolutely won my heart. I'll be back!",5,2016,06,11
120,Stay in London,"Over all we have been to London several times over the years, now find it is a good place to stay away from, the streets were just a giant car park, don't take a cab unless you have a deep pocket walking around very congested like the roads.
Shops are terrible to find anything, if you want any ease try Barcelona or Bordeaux.",4,2016,06,11
120,Brilliant,"We stayed for three nights at this hotel. Location is excellent, within walking distance of many sights. Right behind the Tate Modern which is on the riverside with a great atmosphere. 10 minute walk from Borough Market which is a taste sensation.

Cannot fault the service. Make sure you book bed and breakfast which was fantastic. Highlights of breakfast were the quality, the variety, a speedy toaster with toast rack and a chef cooking eggs however you wanted them and pancakes.

The pool and jacuzzi were a nice touch. The room was modern with a brilliant bathroom. The bed was huge and very comfortable. The best thing was the AC was the quietest we have ever had. The only negative was that the view from our window was of a brick wall!! Probably because we booked through Expedia?!?

Overall a lovely hotel in a great location. I would thoroughly recommend.",5,2016,06,09
120,"Awesome hotel, staff, and location","Family of 4 stayed here for 3 nights in May. We are also Diamond members. Booked a twin family room which consisted of two connecting rooms one with a king, and the other one with 2 twins. (not sure if they still offer this) Arrived at about noon after an 8 hour flights and Evi checked us in and did a great job welcoming us. Only one room was ready which was fine. Dropped off our stuff and went to see the city. A few hours later the other room was ready. Rooms were great and good sized, lots of little cool features and a great bathroom setup. Our king room was a deluxe and had an extra lil nook in it which was great for our bags and storing all of our stuff. Our rooms had a fridge with complimentary water, sodas, juice, gummi bears, and peanuts. We all slept great in our beds.
The lounge was great for breakfast, afternoon tea, or happy hour. Margryta on of the attendants in the lounge was always helpful getting us drinks and helping us with food. Good selection of foods and drinks during this time (alcohol included at happy hour). As a diamond member we could also get breakfast in the restaurant which had a larger selection and was excellent as well. We ate at 2 great places nearby called Camino Tapas and Carlos O’Kelly had good Italian and Pizza. There are also some small grocery stores right next door.
The concierge John provided some great recommendations and was very helpful on directions. A tube stop is only a 5 minute walk away. The Tate Modern is very close walk, and its easy to walk over several bridges. We took the tube several times and one day we took the tube to the tower of London, then walked around all day to Buckingham Palace, London Eye, Big Ben and other sites, and decided just to walk back and it was a nice walk with our 2 kids.
It was a lovely stay, with a lovely staff. I hope that I get to come back soon.",5,2016,06,08
120,Still one of the best Hilton's in London,"A return trip to London with work saw me staying at this Hilton again. Staff from the concierge to check in, in the bar and at breakfast were all very friendly. There were some special touches in the room - a selection of soft drinks, water and nibbles in the fridge and an umbrella in the wardrobe which sadly I didn't discover until after the thunderstorm! I ate in the bar for the first time and although a little pricy it was one of the best burgers I've ever had and the selection at breakfast was also very impressive.",5,2016,06,08
120,Holiday for 3 nights,"Very good and clean hotel and good service (not excellent but good enough for 5 star standards). Breakfast had a wide-range of different things, which was great! The only minus was the location which is a bit far from attractions, but with underground you can easily reach attractions.",5,2016,06,08
120,Everything about this hotel was great!,I was in London for a work trip mixed with a little pleasure.  The hotel was conveniently located within walking distance of the office and lots of attractions.  The service here was great.  My only complaint would be that when we checked in very late at night the front desk did not provide any information regarding the hotel.  I had to call the front desk with multiple questions that should have been reviewed upon check in.,5,2016,06,06
120,Fantastic,"Faultless! Thoroughly enjoyed every element of it. The location, staff and facilities were all amazing and we didn't want for anything.
The quality and range of offering for breakfast was brilliant and the staff were very friendly. The cleanliness of the room and the hotel overall was very impressive. 
We went to the Oxo Tower for dinner and this was easily within walking distance. ",5,2016,06,06
120,London stay at Hilton Bankside,"We stayed at the Hilton Bankside 6 days after a cruise to Norway. The location was excellent as we could visit most sides walking or using the subway. The hotel staff was very helpful including the concierge helping us getting to the sites we wanted to see. The room was large and very comfortable, and the breakfast was excellent. Overall a very  good experience.  In our next trip to London, we would definitely stay in this hotel",5,2016,06,06
120,Top class!,"My wife and I recently stayed here and were both very impressed. The staff were very helpful, friendly and professional. The room was spotless and the bed was huge and really comfy. Breakfast was incredible and there were hundreds of items to choose from. Would definitely recommend it to others.",5,2016,06,06
120,Sightseeing trip,"I spent 8 nights at the Hilton in a king room. This is a brand new hotel and is well designed. The mini-fridge and tea kettle are hidden in drawers. There are also plenty of electric outlets. The shower was very spacious. 

There are 2 grocery stores on the same street and several restaurants in easy walking distance. The Southwark tube station was a short walk away which made getting around fairly easy. 

Overall I had a very pleasant stay. ",5,2016,06,05
120,"New hotel, but with noisy floors","I have stayed here twice now and it is a nice new hotel in a useful location, part way between Waterloo and London Bridge.  The rooms are not huge, but being new they're clean and well appointed.  
However, I did experience some noise during my stay, which is a huge bug-bear of mine in hotels, so I will only stay here again if I can't get into any other nearby hotel.  In all cases the noise was generated by the fact that the entrance hallway in the rooms seems to be tiled flooring.  So any late night arrivals inevitably wake up their neighbours with clattering heels and luggage wheels.  A strange choice of flooring in my opinion.
Aside from the weird flooring choice, it's a nice hotel in an accessible part of London.",3,2016,06,05
120,Excellent,Really smart new London hotel with excellent rooms and the comfiest beds. A lovely swimming pool and well equipped  gym. Great buffet breakfast and a large bar so it was always easy to get a seat and get served. Service was very good throughout the hotel. Location great as it's only 5 mins from Southwark tube and 2 mins behind the Tate. Would highly recommend this hotel especially if you don't want or need  to be in the West End. ,5,2016,06,05
120,Highly recommended,"Great short break,excellent service excellent king deluxe rooms,we had a bathroom with walkin shower very roomy.rooms cleaned everyday of our stay.excellent location for getting around london.Evening meal superb. Bar staff very knowledgeable if you like cocktails.restaurant food beautiful do recommend the steak cook to perfection. Would stay again thank you to the very welcoming staff .and a very big thank you to the welcoming Bar staff you know your cocktails and drinks .",5,2016,06,04
120,excellent location,"got this on offer with b&b and free wifi .In a built up area, hotels and business blocks (clean and presentable streets,well lit and safe feel) few minutes walk from Blackfriars station, so close, the Eye, London Bridge,St.Pauls westminster, SHAKESPEARS DOME etc,we were in london for 3 days and didnt need the bus or trains. hotel is fab, rooms are so clean and functionally modern, beds so comfy and great shower! , buffet breakfast-yummy perfect set up for the day. staff really nice. cant wait to return :)",5,2016,06,03
120,Amazing Hotel for Leisure or Business!,"If I write a review about a hotel or restaurant, it is because I have strong feelings about it.  I definitely have strong feelings about the London Hilton Bankside.  I stayed there for 7 nights along with my pregnant wife and 5-y.o. daughter and all three of us LOVED it.  The hotel might cater to more of a business clientele, but I highly recommend this hotel for families based on our experiences.  Here are some of the highlights below, but honestly, I could write pages about all the things we liked about the hotel.

Room:  We had a Junior Suite and it was very spacious for London standards and even for US standards, which we’re used to.  The beds were comfortable, there were plenty of amenities in the room/bathroom and everything was clean and modern, which it should for a new hotel.  If I had to make a minor complaint, I would say that the bathtub/shower is difficult to enter and exit because of how high the tub ledge is.  The hotel should had an extra bar to ensure the guests have more support to get out of a wet bathtub.  But overall, we had no major issues and felt very comfortable (including my pregnant wife) coming back to the room to rest after a long day traversing the city.

Service:  The staff -  concierge, housekeeping, front desk, restaurant, executive lounge staff and bellhops/doormen were OUTSTANDING.  My wife and I have each travelled extensively and stayed in many prestigious hotels (Four Seasons, Ritz, Mandarin Oriental, etc.) and the staff at the Hilton London Bankside were right up there with those hotels.  I’d especially like to recognize Per, and John from concierge.  They treated my daughter like a celebrity and gave her a truly positive impact and memory of her stay in London.  We HAD to make sure she got a picture with the both of them before we left.  

Hotel Location:  The location is great.  Only a 5 minute walk to the Southwark station and only a 10 minute walk to the Waterloo station.  The Thames is only 5 minutes to the north and Borough Market is about 7 minutes to the east.  Also, a walk from the Westminster/Big Ben area to the hotel (along the Thames) was only a 25 minute walk and it was beautiful.  There are a handful of good restaurants in the general vicinity as well as a couple convenience stores and a Starbucks when you’re in a bind.  The hotel felt like a good location as a home base for a lengthier stay in London as we had.

Hotel Facilities:  The Executive Lounge, for those who have the privilege of using it, was a great place to rest, have a drink and a snack.  The staff is very friendly and always had a smile on their face.  The indoor pool was nice and the water was warm.  My daughter loved it and didn’t want to leave.  I didn’t use the gym but it looked pretty good from what I could see.  We ate at the hotel restaurant our first night in town and thought the food was very good.  I really liked the food and the restaurant’s atmosphere.",5,2016,06,03
120,Excellent hotel,"The hotel was first class. Huge bed, lovely comfortable room. Walk in shower with a choice of overhead water or shower head on the wall.
Staff were polite and attentive. They could not do enough to make your stay comfortable. 
Breakfast was delicious with a huge choice.
A short walk to The Globe or by the riverside. Excellent restaurant or a choice of local places to eat.
Would definitely recommend.",5,2016,06,02
120,Excellent hotel.,"Excellent service and quiet rooms.  Great location, easy to get to the Tube. Walking distance to the Thames and the River Walk.  Loved that the room had a small fridge for storing fruit and water. The shower was amazing!!",4,2016,06,02
120,"Wonderful hotel, excellent location, would recommend!",We loved this hotel from the moment we arrived the staff were super friendly and helpful really made us feel welcome. The location is great it's in a quiet part of the city yet minutes away from the tube and attractions. The room was amazing (deluxe king suite) it was massive with very comfy bed. We had club room access which was brilliant got breakfast afternoon tea and drinks and Canapys in the evening. Although we were so busy sight seeing the second day we only used the breakfast (tasty) which made me wonder if it was worth the extra but I think it probably was😀. The pool was nice - again we were busy doing other things so only used it once. It's really good to get a bike to explore the less busy parts of London and the parks we enjoyed that and there is a bike hire just near the hotel. I would definetly return to the Hilton Bankside and I would recommend as well. ,5,2016,06,02
120,"rude front desk, shame.....","Stayed at this hotel for 10 days, but the staff from the front desk was very rude and disrespectful. As a well established hotel chain you would think it should be run like a well oiled machine. However this certainly was not the case. 

Paid in advance for a room, requesting a bath, but they only gave me a room with shower. Asked for another room with a bath. Was asked for another £100, on top of more than already £200 paid. After a half day waited, was told there wasn't a room with bath available. Manager apologised as I left. But, really, not good enough for a 5* hotel. 

Most importantly, I called room service and asked for carrots and the staff asked additional 5 pounds cash.

Measure of a good hotel is not when things go well but when they go wrong. And this was very wrong.",1,2016,06,02
120,The extra mile is what counts,Hilton once again has excelled itself - high quality generally and superb customer service - the manager went the extra mile - service faultless - cannot recommend this hotel highly enough - breakfast top quality and location cannot be bettered,5,2016,06,01
120,"we loved the service, ammazing breakfast ,decor and the spacious room","Amazing can't wait to go back. Stayed here as a weekend treat over the bank holiday.best thing about it is the service.. Reception/Concierge/housekeeping impeccable service... These guys are extremely attentive to guest needs! Breakfast buffet is amazing.. Sorry ""other hotels Mondrian"" we wont be back!the breakfast in the restaurant was among the best we've ever had in Europe - with an amazing assortment of foods all deliciously prepared and beautifully presented.Spacious rooms & well designed ultra modern amenities makes the stay very comfortable. Very close the Tate modern museum & Borough Market.cant stop praising this hotel.",4,2016,06,01
120,Amazing can't wait to go back ,"Stayed here as a birthday treat over the bank holiday weekend managed to book the penthouse suite and did not disappoint, 
I loved it large lounge area big bedroom and lovely bathroom with even better shower 

Hotel staff couldn't do even for you we had a little mix up to start with but they went over and above to correct it 

Pool and leisure area lovely we were the only ones in the pool nice and warm 

Can't wait to go back ",5,2016,06,01
120,Great hotel,"Stayed here as was attending WPM conference which was also at the Hilton, because of this I had reduced room rates so was very good value for money.  Great range of food for Breakfast and rooms really nice.  Staff were very friendly and made you feel extremely welcome.",5,2016,05,31
120,"Not our usual, but now will be","We don't normally stay here when in London... We tried this hotel this year and we will be back.. Very clean and new, best thing about it is the service..

120,Weekend Bread,"Stayed one night for a short weekend break.  Very friendly service.  Room spacious and clean.  Perfumed smell pumped out A/C in lobby a little overpowering. Did not have breakfast as this was an expensive extra, however short walk to southwalk tube station and Borough market not too far away.",4,2016,05,30
120,Its Better at the { Hilton ] Bankside London,"My company held a sales conference over three days in May 2016 and we couldn't fault any aspect of the service and hospitality which was superlative.

I have stayed prior to this and the recommendation from a fellow traveller was well founded as the location is excellent on the periphery  of Southwark with great pubs , bars and restaurants and close to such tourist sights as the London Eye.

The hotel's own restaurant OXBO was very good , really good food with great service as is the bar which is staffed by a young , very friendly , professional and knowledgeable group of guys and gals who make all the guests feel very welcome, in particular Ricky,Michela and Shrina.

The Executive Lounge is really special, great food at breakfast and high tea, very spacious and very comfortable.

Southwark tube station is a 5 minute walk away with access to the rest of London.

It is a great hotel with all the amenities and facilities altho you need and oh the rooms are super modern , clean and spacious.",4,2016,05,30
120,Very comfortable,"A very nice hotel set in the quieter area near London Bridge. Great facilities and the staff are very helpful and attentive.
Had dinner in the restaurant and the starters were not quite right. The restaurant manager immediately apologised and removed it from the bill. They also followed up with a complimentary drink.
The key to any service is how they perform when things go wrong. In this case I cannot fault the staff at the Hilton. Would thoroughly recommend.",4,2016,05,30
120,Best Hilton in London,"I stay in hotels extremely frequently and  can honestly say this hotel was amazing. The staff were all so accommodating, friendly, kind and couldn't do enough.  Really approachable and inviting reception, excellent standards on food, location and extra touches like cards, cakes and it has such a brand new modern feel.  I can't wait to come back this weekend and try the new penthouse suite for another celebratory weekend.  Hard to beat I can see this now becoming a regulary stop over,  I just had to share this find.",5,2016,05,29
120,Great Hotel,"We had a lovely stay here. It was a great location for The Tate and Southbank, and was only a 5min walk to Southwark tube. We were upgraded to a lovely room. The only downside was a lack of view. There was great live music, and the cocktails and food were lovely. Highly recommend. ",5,2016,05,29
120,What a gem!,"My wife and I stayed here on a Saturday night and had a lazy Sunday breakfast. The welcome on arrival was detailed and professional as we checked in and we got a call within three minute in our room from reception to ask if the room was ok and to our expectations. We had a cold beer in their executive lounge, out fit dinner then a cocktail nightcap in the superb bar with our lovely waitress. Breakfast was delicious with the best pastry display and choice with 3 chefs cooking fresh fried eggs 
Clearly a well run hotel with exceptional service and staff. Well done!",5,2016,05,29
120,"Excellent location, smart new hotel","The location is perfect, in a quiet side street yet 5 mins walk from the river, the bars and restaurants of London Bridge or Waterloo and on the Jubilee line to get into town. The hotel is brand new and the rooms and common facilities reflect that. The bar is fabulous, the staff are very friendly and helpful.",5,2016,05,29
120,Great conference hotel,"Conference facilities were excellent, particularly the food which was very nice. Rooms were very modern, neat and clean though don't have great views - go for a high level. Bed was comfy, though a little soft for me. Would definitely recommend and be happy to visit again.",5,2016,05,29
120,My preferred London hotel for business trips,"I travel to London to work in our City office every couple of weeks or so,  and Hilton London Bankside is always the first place look for a room. Everything is always spotlessly clean and the whole property has a high quality and luxurious feel to it. Location is convenient for a walk to the City,  and there's probably 3 tube or rail stations easily walkable.  The restaurant food is as pricey as you would expect in a London Hilton,  but very good quality. The tapas in the bar are very good if you just want something small. There is a reasonable gym with a handful of cardiovascular machines,  a cable multi gym and a few kettle and free weights. If you have access,  the executive lounge is excellent,  especially for breakfast when it is lovely and peaceful and the staff are friendly. In fact, all of the staff I have dealt with are extremely friendly and helpful. ",5,2016,05,29
120,Great hotel! Loved it!,"Terrific hotel, great service, free wifi and free mini bar - very clean, amazing beds, comfortable and new.  Loved it and will definitely stay there again when we go back to London.  Also reasonably priced.",5,2016,05,28
120,Gem of a hotel in central London - definitely recommended,"I stayed 25-27 May, 2016 (2 nights); for business.

This is an outstanding hotel in central London. I enjoyed my stay very much, and I will definitely stay again. I will summarise the pro's and Con's below:

1. The location is very good. The hotel is a short walk to Southwark and Blackfriars tube-stops, which gives access to the London under- and over-ground. The hotel is centrally located, so, very convenient for London business.
2. The hotel is very modern, so, it looks ""new"", which is great.
3. There are two late-night supermarkets downstairs, so, obtaining any essential extra's late at night is very convenient. 
4. The executive lounge is fantastic, large and with a great selection of drinks and snacks. Plenty of seating, and very friendly staff. Thank you Matas and Kevin, you were great!
5. The rooms are very well-appointed. I stayed on the 6th floor in a one-bedroom suite, which had a lovely view of The Shard, and a great bathroom, with an outstanding shower! The suites are very spacious, which is precious in London!
6. The reception staff are very friendly, efficient, and professional. Thank you, Stephane!
7. There is everything you need in the rooms: iron, ironing board, plenty of bathroom amenities, and very modern fridges, with space for your own items (not common in Hiltons!).

Here are the Con's:

1. The location! It is great once you get there. Getting there from the airport is a different story. Heathrow Express from the airport into Paddington.... is where the problems start. There is no direct tube line. Best is connecting to the Jubilee Line via Baker Street. The problem is that Baker Street is the worst and most traveller-with-luggage-unfriendly train station in London. The route from the hotel to the airport had me carting luggage up and down twelve flights of stairs to finally get the Heathrow. I did not like this.
2. The hot water in the bathroom is not hot. You can hold your hand under the hot tap with ""maximum hot"" on, without any discomfort.
3. At check-in: no upgrade, no mention of upgrade. I always feel that when the Hilton chain is dealing with a customer on the highest tier of their loyalty programme, one shouldn't have to ask. This information should simply be provided: ""there are no rooms available for upgrade"", or ""you have been upgraded"". The suite I booked was great, but.... this is supposed to be part of the Hilton Diamond package.
4. Check your bill at the end. Somehow, as is typical of all Hilton's in London, you always did take something from the minibar, even when you didn't...
5. The internet kicks you out after 24 hours, and you have to re-log in. There should be a two- or three-day option to avoid this. 

Overall, a great hotel with a very nice staff, but there are places for service improvement. Still gets a 5/5 from me. I definitely recommend it.",5,2016,05,28
120,Excellent experience,Very welcoming and obliging staff. Ideal staff attitude and attentiveness. Room excellent. Some difficulty with heating control but overall very comfortable stay. Breakfast excellent variety and quality.,5,2016,05,28
120,Almost Perfect Stay!,"My fiancée and I have just returned from a 2 night stay and we absolutely love this hotel! Its location is perfect, like an oasis away from the hustle and bustle of the town but still close enough for easy access to everything. On arrival we were handed some delicious cake whilst we waited to check in and more cupcakes on our way to the room! We stayed in a deluxe King, which was clean and modern with a really comfy bed, a lovely hot rain shower and big robes. We paid extra for breakfast each morning, it was a bit expensive for the amount you end up eating but it was convenient for us and there was a good selection of hot and cold and it was all delicious. Breakfast was served in the executive lounge which was beautifully furnished, very luxurious. The service was brilliant, we felt very spoilt. I guess the only problem came on check out when we were billed for something we'd used in the minibar...on arrival we were told everything apart from alcohol was complimentary which wasn't a problem as neither of us drink but we had forgotten our toothpaste so we opened the pack in the minibar which contained toothbrush, teeny tube of toothpaste, plasters etc and for this we were charged £11.25!!!!! This was a bit of a shock and it really needs to be made more obvious that this kit is charged for if opened as I've never experienced that in any other hotel. But we did love our stay and would definitely come back.",5,2016,05,28
120,great stay in a fabulous hotel,"Fabulous hotel, very comfortable bed with what seemed like a floating quilt. Very friendly staff, great location and amazing food. Good size, streamlined and clean room with little sound penetration. The pool and jacuzzi were an added bonus. Did I mention the delicious scrambled egg at breakfast?",5,2016,05,27
120,Lovely Hotel but Breakfast Welcome lacking,"This is a very new hotel in quite a fast developing part of London.  It's about 10 minutes walk to Waterloo and only 5 minutes to Southwark tube.  There are lots of shops and eateries nearby and London Bridge isn't too far.  We had a standard inward looking room which means that you basically look out onto the inner courtyard but that isn't a big issue.  I would think that rooms on the outside have pretty good views.  The rooms aren't huge but adequate and have everything you need.  Very well decorated and lovely fittings with very nice en suites.  All very clean.  Would have given 4 stars except for lady (Silvia) on Breakfast reception.  On both mornings she wasn't at the entrance.  The first time, after waiting about 5 minutes, we decided to just sit down.  She immediately appeared and rather than just take our room number made us get up and go back to the desk before leading us back to a table.  The next morning she wasn't there again and quite a queue was forming.  We again had to wait about 5 minutes and she apologised saying that it was busy (didn't look busy to me) and that it was not normal to have to wait.  I responded that it must be normal as we had had the same experience the previous day.  She then responded that it wasn't and tried to argue with me about this fact all the way to the table even when I had asked her politely to stop answering me back.  I think she needs some training in customer service.  Shame as all the other staff were polite and courteous.",3,2016,05,26
120,One of the best business hotels I've stayed in London,"I've stayed at the Hilton London Banside about a dozen times so far both on vacation with my family and on business and I've found the hotel to be close to flawless by London standards. 

Staff are professional and polite. Rooms are a reasonable size and well appointed. The gym and swimming pool are excellent. Please note that this all needs to be taken into the context that this is a LONDON hotel and space will alway be a premium and a decent London Hotel gym is actually quite poor by international standards. 

The executive lounge is very nicely laid out and comfortable and evening snacks are of a high standard. The drinks service is not serve yourself and feel a little stilted as a result. 

The restaurant is excellent although maybe a touch pricey. 

All in all one of the best business hotels I've stayed in London although the location may not suit everyone.",5,2016,05,25
120,What a pleasant surprise,"There I was expecting an old fashioned stuffy , even pretentious , large , impersonal big hotel and was blown away by the exact opposite - loved the intimate, contemporary personal vibe. Warm and friendly yet vibey and modern.",5,2016,05,25
120,smart hotel,"great hotel in a good location, brilliant breakfast only problem they don't sell pints in the bar only halfs £4.50 at the bar £4.00 if you sit at a table and the waitress gets it,rooms are spot on clean and comfortable bed",5,2016,05,24
120,Great stay,Great hotel! Excellent location - metro is about 5 min walk and plenty of things to walk to without needing the tube! Big clean rooms and really comfortable bed. We were able to keep our luggage there after checking out for a few hours easily,5,2016,05,24
120,"Excellent overall, however a couple of niggles...","This is a stylish new hotel.  All the staff were friendly, welcoming and professional.  The bed was extremely comfortable and there was little noise travel from adjacent rooms.  

The lounge was lovely and the staff there really good and accommodating.  The breakfast is very good - superb quality.

Now to the niggles which all relate to the room: awkward to dry your hair using the hairdryer provided with a coiled flex, the plug socket at skirting board level and only the mirrors inside the wardrobe to see what you are doing.  The only other mirrors are in the bathroom and the flex isn't long enough to even get to outside the bathroom room opposite the mirror there!  I prefer to sit at a dressing table with a mirror to do my hair and make up, but I couldn't here.  There was a lack of decent storage space for anything other than clothes on hangers. I am only of average height - the only shelf in the wardrobe was too high for me to use other than for storing my suitcase.

The TV reception in the room was terrible - every channel badly pixelated.

The pros outweigh the cons, but some design flaws in the bedroom set up.",5,2016,05,24
120,Great location,"We stayed 3 nights at this hotel, in May. The hotel is situated in city center, at about 15-20 min of walking to London Eye or Big Ben. Also, you can go in 5 min to the underground station and some bus stations. 
The hotel staff is very friendly and ready to help you when you need something. The room was very clean and nice equipped, with a enough space, very comfortable bed and big TV.
The breakfast extremely variate and we appreciated a lot that you can ask the chef for something (e.g. an omelette) and they prepare very fast in front of you.

So, we liked the hotel based on its location, staffs, rooms and breakfast. We kindly recommend it and also we will choose it again, when we'll visit London again",5,2016,05,24
120,Refreshing Hilton Experience!,"Stayed 3 nights at the Hilton London Bankside and from now on this will be my regular address when staying in Central London. The hotel is located in a great area, just a few minutes away from the amazing Borough Market, Tate Modern and Southwark station which connects you to the rest of London. 
Once you enter the lobby you immediately feel relaxed. The smell, the staff, the interior, everything is so inviting. The reception staff is great and welcoming, special thanks for Jan for taking care of us and being so kind during our stay. Not only reception staff, also the fitness/swimming pool staff, housekeeping and restaurant staff are all excellent. They are a huge plus to this hotel. The rooms are very stylish, great bathroom and very comfortable bed. 
Another big plus was the breakfast. The choice of food was very wide, next to the normal choices you get when staying at Hilton there are lots of unique choices (delicious homemade granola, wish I could've taken it home with me!). Also the staff in the restaurant was very friendly and helpful. I also recommend having dinner at the restaurant, great food! 
Honestly there is nothing bad to say about this hotel. It is a unique, refreshing and stylish Hilton property that also breathes the character of the area it is situated in. Wish I could go back already!",5,2016,05,23
120,"Lovely hotel, helpful staff","As you would expect from a Hilton, rooms were great, breakfast was fantastic and staff were helpful. Good location - in the centre of town quickly. If I was being really fussy there really should be a mirror at the table in the bedroom.",5,2016,05,23
120,Fabulous Stay,"Another Great stay at the Hilton Bankside, this hotel could be a great blueprint into modern hotels.

Handy for the South Bank, Borough Market and London Bridge.

This time got a room with a view rather than the blank internal wall like last time.

The rooms are airy, very modern and comfortable although the air-con can be a little noisy at times.

Loved the free snacks for being a returning guest and the breakfast is amazing, probably one of the best hotel buffets around. Cornish Yarg yum.",5,2016,05,23
120,Can't fault,"I booked a room after an all day meeting. From the moment I arrived, I was pleasantly surprised ... The soft lighting, quiet music and gentle fragrance in reception are a welcome break from the streets of London.

Jan at reception was friendly, professional and welcoming and helped me select the best room for my needs (I like a quiet room, away from the elevator).

It was also lovely to be acknowledged as a regular Hhonors guest and offered more as a result. It seems many other Hilton venues simply offer a free bottle of water, a few extra points and faster internet, but Jan offered a better room category and a later checkout, which was very welcome.

The room was immaculate, large and pristine (the hotel has only been open 7 pr 8 months).  The bathroom was large and the walk-in monsoon shower very welcome.

The curtains blocked out all light and there was no noise from the street (it's a surprisingly quiet area).

It was also a pleasure to find a hotel with more than enough plug sockets for gadgetry. Great, too, to finally have a hotel room with sockets next to the bedside tables ... In an era where we use our phones as alarm clocks, it's surprising how few hotels have sockets next to the bed.

The staff member that brought my bag up to my room was polite and engaging.

The restaurant was a bit busy at breakfast, but not unpleasantly so, and staff - again - were friendly, efficient and professional.

I had a relaxing stay and wouldn't hesitate to recommend.",5,2016,05,22
120,Excellent hotel,"Me and my cousin had the pleasure of staying at this wonderful and perfectly located hotel for three nights, celebrating her birthday. We were both really impressed with the service and friendly staff as well as very clean and comfortable rooms. Before leaving we decided that next time we are in London we will definately come back here again! Thanks for a memorable weekend. ",5,2016,05,22
120,414 happy Hilton customers,"Yes, there really was 414 of us. 

Not all stayed but I did as the lead organiser of a Saturday evening banquet for charity, with not a single complaint from those who wined and dined. Service was super efficient, the food was great and the banqueting hall is huge.

I didn't have much time to make use of the hotel's other facilities but the room was also spacious and the breakfast next morning was bountiful and delicious.

I will be back - with another 400 or more next year.",5,2016,05,22
120,Top Hotel,Stayed here for hubby's birthday.  Near main road but no noise disturbance.  Comfortable bed and nice touch with the turn down service. Breakfast was amazing - everything from cereal and pastries to full English.  Eggs cooked to order (except scrambled - which were lovely).  Nice touch with the coffee machines so you can have cappuccinos or espressos with your brekkie.  Highly recommend the Oxbo restaurant for your evening meal.  All staff polite and very helpful and nothing seemed to be too much trouble.  Will definitely go back.,5,2016,05,21
120,21st Birthday Weekend,"Easy to access from jubilee line at Southwark tube station, great location, our room on third floor, poor view outside window with brick wall. 
Staff were excellent very curtious and attentive. Comfortable beds, staff replenished toiletries water when asked. We had cocktails and nibbles in bar very friendly staff and excellent beverages. My daughter used the swimming pool and was impressed with the facilities.
Would recommend.",5,2016,05,21
120,Weekend stay,"I flew in from the states and arrived prior to check-in time. They took my bags for me while I waited and told me they would call when the room was ready. They didn't call, but the room was ready early (luckily I checked). I was very grateful to get into my room. 

The staff is exceptional, exactly what you want when you're traveling to another country.

The room is clean, quiet, and nice. I only have a couple of ""what the heck?"" moments: First there isn't an iron and ironing board in the room. in america its part of the standard room amenities; second, the plug for the hairdryer doesn't fit into the bathroom outlet, so you have to dry your hair without a mirror.

There is a restaurant and a bar in this hotel, so you don't have to go far if you just need a bite or a drink. They are both nice and the staff in both are very accommodating.

The location seems to be within walking distance of everything. If you don't like walking the doorman is happy to get you a cab, or you can take the subway.",4,2016,05,21
120,Business 2 night stay,"Great atmosphere from the lobby up.  Pleasant welcome...last morning not so pleasant.When we checked in...one double one single...the double was upgraded to a suite..my single stayed as booked and it was clearly fitted for the disabled. I am not disabled....now I don't mind really having spent some time as a carer....but I was surprised.
I was disturbed in the morning by the cleaner wanting to clean the room when i had another 3hrs before checkout...yes i know i should have put the ""do not disturb"" sign up but i forgot! The door was locked though so i was surprised to be ""knocked"". After checking out I was to meet colleagues in the executive lounge...I was told it was not available to me until i pointed out my connection with the other room. At this point I was beginning to feel like a second class citizen!....I'm glad I was in a good mood because normally I would have kicked up a fuss...why wasn't my connection shown on their system....I don't much care for feeling like the poor relation!
The gym was fairly well equipped...not quite sure about the new rowing machine....it didn't seem set up properly to me...the member of staff also was a little bemused about how it worked but he also had been assured that it was set up fine...it wasn't!
The pool was good for a swim though I question why it needed to be so warm.",4,2016,05,20
120,Superb,"Location 3mins from Blackfriers Station where you can get the tube or train. Peaceful even though built up area, with plenty of cafes etc nearby for a snack etc. Breakfast at the Hotel truly amazing! You will not go hungry. The staff are just as amazing and look after you from the moment you arrive. Truly brilliant hotel with comfortable well laid out rooms that are spacious. This hotel has a lot to be proud of and great value for money. It has gym & swimming pool too. Hilton should be very proud of this hotel and its staff.",5,2016,05,20
120,Thank you for great stay!,"Lovely hotel, welcoming staff. They did everything to exceed my expectations. A big thank you to Alex- Guest Relations Manager for all the assistance and Cem - The Front of House Manager who was very accommodating. ",5,2016,05,19
120,Various business stays in a great hotel with outstanding staff,"Such a great place in London. When I first stayed here I was so super impressed, that I actually moved all my reservations to this hotel. I stayed in Bankside 5 weeks this year already and many more to come. Every time im checkin-out on Friday I feel like I do not want to leave. his hotel supposedly represents Hilton's ""new style approach"" and meets all the high expectations. As a frequent business traveller, spending most of the weeks and months in hotels, I am always impressed by the staff of this hotel. They are so well trained, professional and attentive, I have hardly seen that in any other Hotel so far on a daily basis. The front desk staff is quick and always tries to meet the guests needs, they also recognize the loyality tier and try to upgrade rooms on avaibility. I wanna highlight Kiana here. But all of them are very very good in what they do.

The rooms are very nice, especially executive rooms are a fantastic. They are spacious and very modern and urban furnished. No big difference between normal and deluxe rooms, as they are both having a good size and an awesome bathroom with normaly a walk in shower which is very comfortable. 
The only thing I can criticise on the room is that you cannot use the hairdryer in the bathroom because of the outlet capacity. You have to dry your hair in the main room. Actually for a guy not a big deal but it could be annoying for female guests, as they often need a mirror. As far as I heard at least. 

The Distillery Bar has stylish furniture and great service. Even on crowded evenings the staff is always so quick with the drinks and the barkeepers are doing a great job. Either recommending a good cocktail, advising on special gins or just having a nice conversation. Meet probably the best barkeeper in London there, Riccardo. He is such a great guy, always smiling, in a good mood and serving the best drinks in town!!! Don't miss him and the Distillery. 

Breakfast is the most sensational i ever had in any hotel. Such a big variety of food, hot and cold dishes and beverages, just too much to have and try all of it. Even after 5 weeks there are still things left I did not try yet. It is always nice to see Silvia in the morning, having a quick chat, bringing me to a prefered table at the windows. Thanks to her and her attentiveness and good mood every morning!

The Executive Lounge is a blast. Same as the whole hotel, chic and stylish with good staff, serving drinks to the table and taking care of everything. Food is good for an evening snack and the afternoon tea was very nice as well.

The Guest Relation Team is highly attentive and does a great job, helping with individual needs and requests. They handle requests fast and efficient, which is especially for me as a business traveller very important. Special thanks to Anneke for always handling my requests and solving any issues. Thanks!

What else, I haven't said the before about a hotel but this place and its staff really make you feel at home and makes you feel comfortable even on hard and long days. It is always a pleasure coming back.

For people complaining about the view, this is still London. You barely find places with a great view and if so, be prepared to spend loads of money for a night. If you are coming to London for the views, this is not the place to be. About the lighting in the rooms, this is a very personal preference. I definitely like the lighting in the rooms, very modern and unique lamps. I actually don't know why people need bright lightining in a hotel. From some reviews you really get the impression, that it is dark in the rooms. Absouletly not true, it is just normal. If you fancy bright light, just bring a torch and light some candles. 
The location: Simply great! On the one hand probably not the best if you are in the city just for 2 nights and not good in walking, on the other hand it is such a great feeling to step outside the door and don't get overrun by a herd of tourists or people staring at at their smartphones. It is a 15-20 mins walk to London Bridge/The Shard and a 25-30 mins walk to T-Square. Southwark station is a 5 mins walk, Blackfriars 5-10 mins and Waterloo 15 mins. So nothing to complain about.

The only thing I am afraid of is that the hotel gets more and more popular and either that they will increase rates or they change staff. Keep this team as long as possible. For me this is the reason and the big difference to other 5 star hotels. The level of service and guest satisfaction is outstandingly high.

See you later at Bankside!   

By the way: Look for the details in the hotel. There are quite a few things to discover with a story behind them. Eg.: The Foxes - ask for the story behind them.",5,2016,05,19
120,Anniversary stay,Beautiful hotel in a perfect location especially fo the Shard. The room was comfortable and the bed amazinge the bathroom and shower were superb. Breakfast was beautiful cooked to order and lots of healthy choices on the buffet.. The distillery bar was really good especially the Shakespeare cocktails. The staff were very helpful and friendly still new but would definitely stay again.,5,2016,05,18
120,Lovely brand new hotel but still design flaws,"I stayed here on business for 2 days but with my husband and had an executive room.

The hotel on entrance was great, reception area all very nice and inviting, a luxurious feel about it but then we got to the room....

Our room view was of a brick wall from the building next door, we called reception and asked to move to another room of the same value/level for a view but were informed that ALL executive rooms have the same view - I just think its mad!

You pay a higher rate for such a room yet get lumbered with such a terrible room view.  The room was also VERY dark in interior design so to have zero natural light come in made the room feel very dark and gloomy, and unfortunately not in a romantic, seductive way.

Such a shame on what could have been a really great hotel room.",3,2016,05,18
120,Excellent birthday stay!,"Just returned from a fabulous 2 night stay at the Hilton Bankside 

The hotel is in a fabulous location for getting around London and was beautifully modern and fresh.

We upgraded to a suite which came with lounge access which was faultless ! 

The staff are very professional, friendly and helpful and couldn't have done more 

The distillery bar was a highlight! 

Would definitely return !",5,2016,05,17
120,Fantastic hotel,"Stayed here for two nights in May. The staff are amazing, everyone falling over themselves to make sure everything is exactly as you want; from reception to housemaids and waiting staff. Very quiet. Comfortable beds. Breakfast was excellent both days. Lovely smell in the public areas. No negatives. Will definitely return to this hotel.",5,2016,05,17
120,The Bankside hotel of recommendation ,"The hotel to merge the needs of relaxation, good times and business. 

The staffs very welcoming and friendly with good sense of service and an eye out for any occasion to be helpful. 

The breakfast not all as to desired if following an athletes diet as all vegetables were at display rather than an offer for nutrition. 
On the other hand two chiefs were at their marks to cook, prepare and serve any likings in eggs. 

All rooms in great standard and great soundproofing walls and doors to enable quiet and peaceful sleep. 

The bathrooms big and comfortable with new interiors. 

Finding former guests plasters in the shower put the first impression to the less positive side. 

This is hotel I will return to whenever I go to the Bankside of London and I will recommend this to every adult who wants to go for London to enjoy and explore the vibrant life in the area of Borough market and Bermondsey str",4,2016,05,17
120,Nice hotel with friendly staff,"We had a fast check in and got a fairly ok room. Missing a Music dot for iPhones that could have been nice. 

Breakfast good and very good service. 

However we dont like to The use of fragances / floders from reception area. Having an allergy its not really great.",4,2016,05,17
120,Best Hilton in London,"Due to my work, I have now stayed in just about every Hilton and Doubletree in London - this one beats the rest hands down.  We actually stayed here on a Saturday night on points and were upgraded to the executive floors and as Hilton Diamond members, also had access to the Executive Lounge.  The rooms themselves are everything you could hope for - large, comfortable, very sleep-inducing beds and lovely new linen and towels.  The location is brilliant - just behind the Tate Modern, but slightly away from the main drag makes it easy to walk to everything but also assures a quiet night.
But, for me, it's the Lounge that makes it - with other Hiltons they are a bit restricted and a bit of an afterthought - this one is large, comfortable and with a wide range of drinks, afternoon tea and evening nibbles - fantastic!",5,2016,05,17
120,Very positive experience,"Stayed at the Hilton, Good hotel though not quite so central. However the ambience and hotel staff more than made up. Hotel is welcoming, staff are exceptionally well trained, helpful and professional.",4,2016,05,15
120,A good alternative ,"Stayed here for three nights this May. This is one of the newer additions to the Hilton stable in London, and it clearly shows!!! 

On the positive, one finds a hotel at a good location, highly-motivated staff really going out of their way to be of service, a hotel with a fresh design and very functional rooms, and roomy, modern bathrooms. The Club also works very well with an extremely attentive staff. 

At the same time, the hotel still feels a bit rough around the edges: Room A/C set at 21 degrees centigrade, feeling like an ice chamber (getting comfortable at 25 degrees, a temperature, I usually don't like to experience in a hotel room), and the water-saving toilet feature not really working properly. Consequently, it felt like my room hadn't really passed final inspection.

Net, net: This hotel we be staying on my roster for London. ",4,2016,05,14
120,Perfect stay - and I've never said that before!,"Stylish, modern business hotel that delivered faultlessly. The room was very quiet, the bed very comfortable, the TV system functions all worked fully, the lighting and air con all worked properly and sensibly, the wifi connected easily and was suitably fast, the bathroom with walk in shower was spotless, the towels were fluffy, there was an iron, safe, dressing gown. It really was impossible to find fault, and in fact it was one of the best most relaxing overnight stays I've had in London. Excellent!",5,2016,05,14
120,Essentially Superb,"We are a hard bunch to please, in our daily routine but much more when traveling.

Having said that, we were happy to find out that we are staying in what is probably among the best hotel of its price range in London. 

The staff, especially Corina, are among the best we have encountered in our many world travels, including London for over a dozen of other, similar, visits.

The design is state of the art, being both helpful and elegant.

The rooms are clean, the bed is comfortable to the point of sleeping way later than you should and there is excellent and fast WiFi coverage. They do make you re-login once in 24 hours but that is a rather small (though utterly unnecessary) trouble.

The breakfast is extraordinary, out shining many of the nicest cafes in London and reaching to Albion-like levels (which is recommended on its own).

The location is great. The south bank is quieter and interesting than the north bank, yet you can reach the later quickly via tube or just by walking along one of the bridges.

Highly recommended.
",5,2016,05,14
120,Shocking,"From the moment I arrived to the moment I left ,staying in this hotel was a complete catalogue of errors and mix ups. The staff were rude and disrespectful. The food was awful ! As a well established hotel chain you would think it should be run like a well oiled machine. However this certainly was not the case at the Hilton Bankside. 
I recommend to any traveller to give this hotel a miss as there are far nicer hotels in this vicinity.",1,2016,05,14
120,Bankside newbie,"Great hotel with good features, lovely staff at a fair price. Will definitely be staying again. Only criticism would be limited gym equipment, though this is mitigated by the great location. My new favourite London hotel. ",4,2016,05,14
120,Lived up to expectations,"Having read press and trip advisor reviews I was very much looking forward to my stay and it did not disappoint. Great staff, excellent rooms, lovely pool and changing rooms, good location. I really did not want to leave. Can't praise the management and staff enough, best I've encountered in this country.",5,2016,05,14
120,Good stay at a good rate ,"The Hilton Bankside
After our last stay in London at the Kensington Hilton, I had second thoughts about booking a Hilton again as it was poor. Thankfully the Hilton Bankside has restored my faith as the hotel met all requirements , from room to the service everything was first class and as I got it at a good rate with breakfast included (£25 otherwise which is a bit much ) it was a well worth it.

",5,2016,05,13
120,A really enjoyable stay at a surprisingly accessible location,"From start to finish this was an impressive example of customer focused attention to detail. 

I stayed here for one night and cannot fault the experience. Attentive doorman and concierge, impeccably trained and attentive receptionist, clean and modern room (I had a deluxe King) and a great breakfast offer. 

I regularly stay at Hilton hotels and this is by far the best one in London so far. Helped by being newly built, there was an impressive and consistent impression that the staff were focused on customer service. 

Breakfast was an exemplar on how to do it. Plenty of choice, fresh high quality food, a hot choice which was actually hot and decent bean to cup coffee. The only downside was a small queue at peak time - but this was caused by the staff wishing to settle each and every guest down at their table!

The hotel room was modern, clean (even in the corners), well presented and, for the first time in quite a while, there was a turn down service that actually prepared the room for our return. Room service was prompt and well prepared - as an example of the attention to detail, it came with a choice of sauces and a single flower on the table...the team here clearly care about how things look. 

This hotel may be 'south of the river' but this should not deter you. Bankside appears to be a increasingly 'hip' part of London and this hotel oozes first class service. I will return when I next need somewhere to stay near to the City and I have no hesitation in recommending it to others. ",5,2016,05,13
120,Great place to stay,"I had a 5 day business stay here and it has been a great place.  From the minute I arrived, service has been outstanding.  Everyone always has a smile and they can't do enough to help. There are a lot of hotels that could learn customer service from the group here. On top of that, the rooms are clean and up to date.  I will come back here anytime I'm in London. It is reasonably close to the underground too. ",5,2016,05,12
120,Nice new hotel,"A new,very nice and quiet hotel. Great breakfast and polite and helpful staff. I like a firm bed, but the bed I got in a twin room was a bit too firm for me. That was the only negative with the hotel. A small Tesco and Sanisbury´s right outside.",5,2016,05,11
120,Fantastic for a big city weekend,"We were 4 couples having a fun weekend in London. The hotel in located near South Bank and Borough Market with heaps of pubs, cafes and reastaurant all over. The rooms were great, big comfy beds and the cleaning was amazing. They cleaned the rooms twice a day! Free good wifi. Breakfast was very exspencive but there are lots of nice cafes in the neighbourhood where you can have a lovely breakfast. The minibar was complimentary but could have had a better selection of drinks....but would love to stay again. Perfect location, perfect service, great staff.",5,2016,05,11
120,Fantastic place,"This is a new hotel, and the place is a treat. Lots of positives, but I guess the most important involves the staff, who were all super-efficient, friendly and helpful. The rooms are very nice and neat, with lovely comfortable beds, nice decor, and great sound-proofing. The location is perfect for the Globe, the Tate, Borough Market and all the delights of Bankside. I really can't fault the stay we had there, and full credit and congratulations go to all there who made our stay such a pleasure. Wouldn't it be great if all hotels were this good?",5,2016,05,10
120,Bravo. Excellence at every interaction.,"Having a fantastic stay at the Hilton Bankside. The hotel itself is clean, modern, comfortable with a staff that is delivering excellence with every interaction. Highly recommended for business travelers and leisure travelers looking for something a little bit different.",5,2016,05,10
120,Best hotel we've stayed in,"Stayed for 2 nights with my husband for my birthday. We arrived a couple of hours too early so just left our luggage there for the afternoon. On our return we were given the room number. Our bags were already in the room! Fabulous room, big, comfortable & spotless. Very friendly staff. In particular Michaela (the bar manager) was excellent at her job, very welcoming and cheerful. She was a credit to the Hilton.",5,2016,05,09
120,Lovely Hotel! Would stay again!,"Stayed at this hotel for a friend’s birthday. At tea time we were brought a lovely slice of cake and fruit from room service – such a lovely thought and made our stay that extra bit special.

Pros:
Location – great for exploring (close to waterloo too)
Decor
Polite and friendly staff
Exec Lounge choice of beverages in the evening
Upgraded to Junior Suite – Room was bigger than normal with a sofa 
Free Mini bar (confectionary & non-alcoholic beverages only)

Cons:
Executive Lounge choice of food
Swimming Pool closed due to maintenance (although this was stated on their website) 
Poached Eggs at breakfast were watery
Self service tea/coffee at breakfast 
Courtyard facing room",4,2016,05,09
120,A lovely hotel with great staff - but poor room design for the ladies,"A new modern hotel on the south bank of the Thames. Great location. All of the staff were lovely, very friendly and helpful. The rooms are modern and very comfortable. However, once again whoever designed the rooms did not consider the ladies.... There is no dressing table and no mirror for doing hair. The bathroom is lovely and well lit, but to do your hair, you have to open the wardrobe door for a mirror, drag a chair over from the other side of the room and use the plug located on the bedside table. 

We booked club rooms which was great. Afternoon tea from 3 til 5, evening bar and canapés from 5:30 til 8. However, I was surprised that to have a full English breakfast in the main restaurant, you have to pay an extra £7. 

Other than that, a great hotel.",5,2016,05,08
120,"Not a fault, 5*!!","Stayed here for 2 nights with my partner and we were both thoroughly impressed... in fact couldn't fault it!!
Beautifully clean & modern room with a lovely bathroom and a very comfortable king size bed. Made you feel like you were staying somewhere luxurious!
I think Hilton have got it spot on and if I could stay at this standard of hotel every time I stayed away from home, I would be a very happy traveller!! ",5,2016,05,07
120,Exquisite experience,"I had booked a Junior suite with access to the executive lounge for 2 nights with my girlfriend. Check-in was scheduled for 15:00. Upon arrival, we were told that our room was not yet ready and would have to wait half an hour. The receptionist kindly escorted us to the executive lounge were we enjoyed a few pastries and beverages. Around half an hour later, the receptionist returned and told us that we had been upgraded to a one-bedroom suite as compensation for the delay. We were once again escorted to our suite and our luggage followed soon after. In addition, I must say the value for money was one of the best in comparison to other 5-star hotels in the area. The excellent attentiveness of the staff, the quality of the room as well as the prime location made our stay all but perfect.",5,2016,05,06
120,Great option near Borough Market in Southwark,We were a bit skeptical as to location. However the hotel is only a short distance from West End theaters and myriad London attractions. We had a Shard facing suite with separate sitting area and comfy king bed. Two large HD televisions and fast free wireless. Great executive lounge with an amazingly intuitive staff. Look for Per the main contact at the front office. Per is an amazing manager. He really should be running a five star resort in some exotic Asian or Caribbean resort. GM take notice. This guy is an amazing professional. Partner and I are Hilton diamond and have seen lots of hotel managers. Excellent housekeeping !  Quick ice service and room service. We will return. Oh and we visited 8 nights and hated to check out. That rarely happens. ,5,2016,05,04
120,A fantastic hotel,"Spotlessly clean with really helpful and friendly staff. I have stayed here 3 times now and each stay has been perfect.
Big comfy beds and a superb executive lounge.
Eva in the reservations department has been really helpful .
My new favourite London hotel",5,2016,05,04
120,Penthouse suite,The staff were outstanding and the hotel location was excellent. The Penthouse suite was extremely luxurious. However the only disappointment were the views from the roof top terrace which were nothing special. One of the selling points had been the views  more emphasis should be placed on the space which did not disappoint. However overall a very enjoyable time and would recommend but not for the views!,5,2016,05,04
120,What a really pleasant surprise,"The best Hilton I have ever stayed in, stunning reception area and it just continued throughout the hotel, corridors are plush and the room was amazing, very modern but also functional, I'd happily move my hotel reservations here and use the tube from Southwark to areas I need to be in, such is the standard of the hotel and at times, the hotel prices are very good.

I'd highly recommend and I will revisit",5,2016,05,04
120,Terrific new Hilton. Great experience!,"Hilton diamond member - I stayed here not long after it opened, I was here for 4 nights a week for about two months, so I'm in a good posiiton to comment. 

The rooms are probably the finest I've ever encountered in a Hilton, really really nice. The staff were on their A game (as you'd expect in a new hotel) and the restaurant food was pricey, but delicious. Probably the best Hilton restaurant I've eaten in. Wonderful for breakfast also. 

Really looking forward to coming back here. 

In terms of location, it's about 8mins of a walk to the nearest underground station.",5,2016,05,04
120,Excellent for couples,"Stayed here whilst attending a concert over a weekend away from kids with my wife. Hotel was superbly located, well presented (very new), great facilities and amazing value for money for the quality you get. Bar man made personal cocktails and entertained us with great stories about the history of cocktails and certain spirits. Overall no problems and all superb. Will be back asap just to stay here.",5,2016,05,04
120,This Is Where Everyone Should Stay,"From the moment we checked in it was completely special.  Eve greeted us and showed us around.  It was our last stay on our Round the World trip and we wanted it to be special.  
This is a brand new facility that is aesthetically really cool.  It has a cool vibe to it while remaining really luxurious.  We stayed in the Junior Executive Suite and had a ton of space to relax and spread out.  It has 1 full enormous bathroom with a spacious stand up and also has a full bathtub that I was actually able to shower in as well.  It also has a little half bath as well :) Loved that!!
The location is great - it offers something different other than just being close to tourist attractions.  It's close to fun local shopping, the Burrough Market, great pubs and restaurants.
Hannah at the Concierge is phenomenal.  She set us up on possible one of the coolest nights in London.  If you'd like to know where we went, you'll have to ask her - It was awesome!!  Thank YOU!!!
The breakfast was incredible. The Executive Lounge was something I might miss more than London itself... almost.
And Evi... She was so spectacular throughout our stay.  She assisted us with so much and truly just made our last nights abroad and of this adventure truly special. Thank you Hilton Bankside... though you are new... you've got it all together and it was a seamless stay with so many little perks and surprises.",5,2016,05,03
120,"A very, very good new hotel. ","I'd been recommended this hotel by  colleagues who'd sung its praises. It did not disappoint. 

We were lucky enough to stay in a King Deluxe One Bedroom Suite.
It was impeccably turned out with a very functional lounge, a guest WC, a cosy bed room and a huge and luxurious bathroom.
Bonus features included free soft drinks in the mini bar, a nespresso-esque machine and really good quality Black out curtains with afforded us a good lie in. 

The bed was very comfortable and we had no noise disturbances - a good night's sleep was enjoyed. 

The executive lounge was stunning, with attentive waiters and good selection of food both in the evening and for breakfast. 

Unfortunately, we didn't have time to enjoy the pool facilities, so cannot comment, but if they're up to the standard of the rest of the hotel, then I'm sure a dip in the pool is warranted.

Staff could not do enough for you and we were made to feel special during our stay. Thank you. ",5,2016,05,03
120,"Not your average Hilton, highly recommended","Hilton is a bit of an odd brand.  Some hotel brands are consistently good (or at least consistent, thinking Travel Inn) but I've stayed in Hilton's that have been great and others really not so.  Luckily this was the former, in fact I'd say this is the nicest Hilton I've stayed in.  It's in a good location, close to all the action at Borough Market and only 5-10 minutes walk from Southwark tube (Jubilee line).  Extremely professional and attentive staff and smooth check in.  I had room 413 which didn't have much of a view but was a good size and very nicely appointed.  I had booked a Deluxe but was upgraded, not quite sure what to as the room looked fairly standard.  The whole hotel has a cosy but high class feel to it.  Room had the usual 42"" LCD TV (with rip off movie rentals, seriously £13+ for a rental is a little excessive), a good sized fridge with complimentary soft drinks and gummy bears, no alcohol as standard.  Large bathroom, again well appointed with a great shower although there was no bath.  It was quiet at all times and well insulated from next door and people in the corridor.  The bed was super comfy and I had a great nights sleep.  Only thing the room lacked was an ironing board and iron, slightly strange oversight for a hotel that must attract a fair number of business visitors. I didn't eat here so can't comment on the food but did meet friends for drinks in the bar.  Be warned it is very expensive, you're looking at around £4 for half a pint of craft lager.  We soon headed out to slightly cheaper venues but its an attractive place to meet none-the-less.  I left not having tried the pool complex which was a regret, it looked lovely in the brochure.  Next time maybe...",5,2016,05,03
120,Lovely new boutique Hilton,"This is my favorite Hilton hotel in London. The place has a lovely unique feel to it, with great details such as the foxes which u find back everywhere in the hotel design. Beautifully designed with eye for detail, in a great neighborhood with top service this hotel has everything for both the business and personal traveller. Have stayed in many hotels in London over the past 20 years, however this is my favorite, and one of the few business hotels I frequent with my family. Amazing value as well compared to other London hotels. Cannot recommend this hotel enough!",5,2016,05,03
120,Good location,"We stayed at the Hilton Bankside for a weekend break in London. The hotel is located in a good area. Only a 10 to 15 minute walk from Waterloo Station. The hotel is new and is obviously in excellent condition. The staff are very helpful, friendly and very smartly dressed. Breakfast was lovely with a very good selection of hot and cold food. The hotel bar has a good atmosphere although the drinks were quite expensive. £3.50 for a dash of coke was excessive making my Rum & Coke expensive !",5,2016,05,02
120,Wonderul hotel,"When last year in September we heard that Glen Close would be performing in Sunset Boulevard once more, we immediately booked tickets and also needed a hotel for the night.
I had saved up around 100,000 Hilton Honor Points so I thought we could have a room for free for that amount. Well, browsing the HIlton hotels in London we came across the not yet open Hilton Bankside, where to our astonishment we could have a one bedroom suite for the amount of points saved!
On our arrival at the hotel we were warmly greeted by a friendly receptionist. And the room was even above expectation! Spacious, very quiet and situated on a higher floor. The bed was wonderful to sleep in. We both slept solidly. Also the breakfast had an excellent choice of offerings - same goes for the afternoon tea and hors d'oeuvres by evening (along with an excellent quality of whine) in the executive lounge.
All in all, it's been a wonderful experience and I would certainly recommend this hotel to others.",5,2016,05,02
120,One of the best,"Really enjoyed this hotel. Staff are friendly, helpful and efficient. Location is great, right by Tate Modern. Room comfortable with quiet air con that actually works. Even have turn down service. Only niggle is why no minibar? Given that swipe your card on arrival no risk to them? ",5,2016,05,02
120,Beautiful Hotel,"This hotel is beautiful - the rooms are so nice

It's also much bigger than average for a room in a London hotel - it's a real luxury to have so much space

It's a new hotel so really nice and modern

I would say breakfast is a total rip off, so we got coffee and croissants from the M&S down the road. However, it's not anymore expensive than other London hotels so if u don't mind paying £25 each for breakfast go for it",5,2016,05,01
120,Great Service - Outstanding Food,We spent 5 nights here at the end of April. We were greeted warmly by Hj at the front desk who (because of our Diamond status) upgraded us to an  Executive King room. Our room wasn't ready yet so she showed us to the Executive Lounge where we ate tea sandwiches and scones while we waited. The Executive Lounge is very comfortable and well appointed - especially when you go there on off-peak times because it can get very crowded. We loved our comfortable spacious room and the breakfast in the restaurant was among the best we've ever had in Europe -  with an amazing assortment of foods all deliciously prepared and beautifully presented. ,5,2016,04,30
120,"Fantastic staff, great location!","Just perfect. We had an executive suite with access to the executive lounge serving breakfast, afternoon tea & canapes. I thought this was fantastic & such a great added bonus. The staff were amazing & I cannot fault the hotel on anything. Location is also great. I hope they keep up this level of service. I'll certainly return on our short London stays.",5,2016,04,30
120,Hilton London Bankside,"I got a very good impression of this Hilton hotel. I traveled alone and stayed for 3 days. Really good location as it takes around 10 minutes to walk to London Bridge and Borough Market. It takes around 3 mins to walk to the closest underground ""Southwark"".  The staff took good care of me and I didn't have anything to complain about other than that the rooms are small compared to what I'm used to. However that is how it is in London from my previous experiences.  I would recommend taking a room with Executive lounge access as that is by far the best option for business people and families. I would not bother with the breakfast if you have access to the Executive lounge as it's pretty much the same.  So all in all i would definitely stay here again on my next trip to London.",4,2016,04,30
120,"A great hotel for business, less for families","We stayed at the Hilton for a week, and it was everything you would expect a Hilton to be: Nice rooms, great breakfast, helpful staff and generaly great value for money. This Hilton is on the southbank, behind Tate Modern, which is a fast renewing area, but mainly for business. There is very little nightlife around, and you have to travel (cab otr tube( across the river for the good restaurants, shows and most sites of the city. We were the only family with kids in the hotel during our stay, and although it was a very  good overall expirience  you should consider all these factors when choosing to stay in this area of London.",4,2016,04,30
120,Best Hilton ever,"We recently spent 7 nights at the new Hilton Bankside. It has a great location being close to the south bank of the Thames, Tate Modern and Shakeaspeare Globe. Within a 1 to 1.5 mile walk you can get to Parliment, British Museum, Nat Gallery, Imperial War Museum, Theatre district, Borough Market, Tower of London etc etc.

The staff were outstanding top to bottom.... Check in, housekeeping, executive lounge etc etc. totally 5 stars.... Better that any other Hilton we have stayed at, and we have stayed at many across Europe, US, Russia, Japan and South America.

Try to get access to the Executive lounge... Great breakfast and appetizer/beer/wine 5.30-7.30 every evening.",5,2016,04,29
120,Bankside Hilton Hotel,"Good place to stay on the Southbank: behind the Tate Modern, 5 minutes from The Globe, quick walk over the Bridge to the other side.  Hotel staff delightful, room clean, comfortable, bathroom first rate, good finishings - no poor workmanship as far as I could see.  No beautiful views, but that is not what I was there for.",4,2016,04,29
120,What a great shame.....,"Gave this hotel a glowing review when I stayed last October. Cannot do so this time. Extremely disappointing and frustrating stay. Paid in advance for a room, requesting a bath. 5th floor room had only a shower. Asked for another room, with a bath. Was asked  for another £100, on top of more than already £200 paid. After a half hour wait in the lobby, was told there wasn't a room with bath available. Eventually there was. For another £25. Manager apologised as I left. But, really, not good enough for a 5* hotel. Measure of a good hotel is not when things go well but when they go wrong. And this was very wrong.",1,2016,04,28
120,Excellent. Highly recommended. ,"I'll definitely be going back to this hotel. Almost faultless. It's pretty much brand new and is really nicely done. Feels very luxurious and both the rooms and public areas are very pleasant. 

Large room, fantastic bathroom, big comfortable bed, no noise, huge walk-in shower. Really fantastic. 

Silly little pedal bin in the bathroom that falls over when you step on the pedal. Who designs these things?

The bar and restaurant are very nice indeed. Although I didn't have dinner, the breakfast spread was superb. 

Wifi was free for me with my HH card but hunk it's chargeable otherwise. This is scandalous in this day and age; hotels don't charge extra for running water and lighting. Why wifi?

Staff were all charming and super-attentive. 

Can't recommend this place more highly. Compliments to the management. 

",5,2016,04,28
120,Excellent hotel for a business traveler,"Stayed here for as few nights recently and I really like this hotel. 
I had a room at the back which was very quiet although not a great view. Large and very comfy bed with nice duvet and pillows. Big desk with plenty of sockets. Big TV with plenty of channels plus tea/coffee facilities. Curtains did a good job of keeping the light out.
Big bathroom with a really good shower with lots of hot water. 
Room was spotlessly clean.
Breakfast was probably the best one I've had for a very long time. Really good selection of hot & cold foods. Pastries were fresh and tasty as was the fruit. Two chefs available for eggs, omelettes and fresh pancakes etc.
Staff excellent throughout.",5,2016,04,28
120,Attentive staff but lacks a basic requirement,"We stayed here for one night over the London Marathon weekend. It's location is good - close enough to the tourist trail south of the river but far enough inland so as not to be disturbed by traffic or crowds. There is also a Tesco Express across the road and a Sainsbury's Local next door for any last minute items you may have forgotten or if you fancy a midnight snack.
The hotel itself is immaculate and the staff are very efficient and extremely welcoming. Nothing appeared to be too much trouble for them. In fact after returning home we discovered that we'd left our washbag and toiletries in the rooms bathroom. I placed a quick call to the hotel to advise them and 5 mins later they called back confirming they had the washbag and would be happy to send it to me (as long as I gave them my credit card details to cover the postage - it was our fault after all). I declined the offer and instead went back to the hotel today to collect the bag in person. 
We stayed in a Junior Suite and enjoyed the additional perks that this entailed (coffee machine in the room, complimentary snacks & soft drinks from the mini bar, free wifi) but, and in my view this is a major omission Considering this hotel was only opened in September last year there were no USB charging points anywhere in the room. Mobile devices are such a big part of peoples lives nowadays I would have imagined that wall and/or desk mounted USB charging points would have been a minimum requirement for such a new hotel. Just as well we remembered to bring our plug-in chargers.
That is the only gripe after our one night so we can consider the stay to be a big success and would happily stay there again.",4,2016,04,26
120,Recommended,"Modern, new hotel. Rooms are medium-sized, but very effective. The beds are great. Gym is a bit small, but if there are not too many people there it works. You have to try the pool. Great relaxation after a long day at work.",5,2016,04,25
120,Great new hotel in an ideal location,"Stayed for one night easy access from Waterloo station 7 min walk or couple minutes in a taxi. 

New hotel and it shows rooms are really modern. Good sized rooms and bathrooms are great with rain shower and massaging shower. 

Check in and check out process quick and efficient, staff were friendly and helpful. 

Would stay again. ",5,2016,04,25
120,Overall experience,"First class hotel and facilities. Excellent position. Friendly, professional staff. Good restaurant facilities and bar. Close to the Tate Modern Gallery and and Burrough Market.  A very pleasant experience in total.",5,2016,04,25
120,"Polite and friendly staff, good location.","The hotel is modern, clean and in easy reach of many local attractions, as well as being convenient for the tube at Southwark. Worth noting that they are very unlikely to have your room available any time before 3pm but may offer you the chance to upgrade to a room that conveniently will be available if you pay a bit more.
Staff were very friendly and helpful.",4,2016,04,25
120,Great Modern Hotel,"We stayed here over the London Marathon weekend. 5 minutes walk from Southwark tube station, situated in an area with loads of bars and restaurants, and a fairly central South of the river location with short walks to several London landmarks.
The hotel itself was modern, felt clean and tidy and we were greeted by very friendly staff on check-in. We had a Twin Executive Room with Lounge access. The bedroom was large, with work area and a sofa. Large t.v. very comfy bed and pillows and a generously sized bathroom.
We had afternoon tea in the Executive Lounge which was quite busy and the only gripe would be that it constantly ran out of food! It needed more and a more regular top-up. Breakfast in there the next morning was completely different, very quiet and loads of food and some great choice.
Enjoyed the stay though and would definitely return again if I was staying in the area.",5,2016,04,25
120,The highest possible standards.,"From the moment you arrive it's obvious this hotel is a cut above the rest.  It's a modern hotel with old fashioned standards that would be expected from a high end hotel.  The bar was delightful but as you would expect pricey (2 gins, 2 half ale, 2 cola's =£54).   The staff were friendly and utterly professional.This new and cutting edge hotel has rooms to match ( we had a suite with a connecting twin room for the children) and we all looked forward to returning to the room for some chillout time in comfort.  In the morning the children were pleading with me to buy them beds exactly the same as the ones they had been sleeping in... we all had the best nights sleep.  This hotel is  perfectly located for great places to eat and attractions from Tate Modern to The London Eye (a short £8 taxi ride or a few minutes on the underground) plus some nice places to eat in easy walking distance. The pool was a delight and actually was the highlight of our trip. The breakfast was the best I've ever had from anywhere... I only regret not eating more! For anyone a bit bothered by smells (hotels often can't escape them) you'll love it here ... the whole place has a neutral smell apart from a very slight hint of the freshest floral note! I have one relaxed husband, two very happy children (aged 5 & 8) and  I'm planning a return trip very soon.",5,2016,04,25
120,London Marathon 2016,"Just left this amazing hotel, I have stayed in a lot of Hilton hotels across the globe and this one currently tops them all.  Room was nice, clean and spacious.  What makes this hotel top my list is the staff they were absolute top notch could not fault them.",5,2016,04,25
120,Weekend stay,"A twin room on the 1st floor. Fully air-conditioned and exceptionally well presented and organised in all aspects. Drink and restaurant meals a trifle expensive but, of generally good quality. Bedroom extremely well laid out & very comfortable. Wet-room style shower & excellent beds. All staff in all areas were exceptionally helpful and attentive.
Brilliant location for a London visit.",4,2016,04,25
120,Lovely hotel - very modern and comfortable,"We stayed at the Hilton the night before the London marathon and it really exceeded our expectations. Our room was huge, ultra modern and super comfortable! The breakfast was also lovely and it was great that it started early allowing runners to eat before heading off. The staff were also very accommodating, allowing us a late checkout and keeping our bags for us. Loved our stay and will definitely be back!",5,2016,04,24
120,Fantastic Hotel on the South Bank,"My wife and I spent a night here before she was due for an operation at Guy's Hospital and decided to splash on a nice hotel for the night.

Overall we had a wonderful stay, with only a couple of points to nitpick. We decided to drive to London and use the Valet Parking at the hotel as this was easily cheaper than the train. It cost £40 and although I'm sure I could have found cheaper parking locally, it was worth the convenience of driving right up to the hotel forecourt. The valet greeted us politely and took our luggage to the front desk and off went the car. The receptionist was a very polite young man who took an interest in our stay and was friendly and chatty whilst checking us in.

My first little gripe was that it took them several hours to bring our luggage up to the room. We checked the room out quickly and decided to head out in to the spring sunshine as opposed to being cooped up on our room. We were out or the best part of 4 hours and on returning to the room there was no sign of our luggage. A quick call to the concierge and 5 minutes later a very apologetic man had our luggage delivered to the room. He was polite and apologised frequently for the delay. As I say, only a minor gripe.

The room itself was a King Deluxe and was very comfortable indeed. It had everything you'd expect from a deluxe hotel room from king size bed, LCD TV, settee, tea and coffee facilities, fabulous walk in shower in a very generous bathroom and complimentary refreshments from the mini bar. The room was warm and comfortable with easy to use air conditioning. On a personal note, I'm not a fan of soft pillows and the pillows were very soft... just a personal preference of mine thats all. But I couldn't fault the room at all!

We checked out in the morning and my second point to pick was that the valet was unavailable so I was given my keys and shown where the car was parked to collect it myself. It was only a 2 minute walk and a beautiful day so I didn't mind, but having paid for the service I can see this would upset some people. I have to say I think this was a one off due to the valet driver being otherwise occupied but still.

And there you have it. A more than pleasant stay in a fabulous hotel in a brilliant location. It was a 5/10 minute walk from Tate Modern on the South Bank and the area was full of bars, restaurants and plenty of places to visit. I will definitely consider this hotel if I ever find myself in South London for the night.",4,2016,04,23
120,Wow factor indeed 5 star lovely food lovely atmosphere ,"Stayed here for two nights with breakfast luckily had a voucher I  bought . Stunning hotel couldn't fault it. Would love to stay again
Quite pricey breakfast alone was £50 we stayed in a deluxe room with the most comfortable huge bed black out curtains were dangerous totally eliminates the aspect of time 

10/10
",5,2016,04,23
120,Nice....,"So it's like a 10 minute walk from London Bridge or if you know the shortcut (side of Nando's) like 3 minutes from Southwark. check in excellent, room big, clean and quiet. mini bar with free soft drinks was a nice touch, tv nice and big, loads of space for hanging stuff up et cetera and the bathroom nice, new and clean. The only downside in the room was no hanging mirror, in fact the only one was in the bathroom. Breakfast was nice and they will make eggs et cetera to order. check out was fine. Don't know whether I would stay again ONLY because our corporate rate was low due to the newness of the hotel, now 3 months on it's like £200 a night! Forgot to say gym and pool were excellent but NO mobile phone reception down there!",5,2016,04,22
120,This is what every Hilton should aspire to be!,"I've stayed at many Hilton hotels over the years.  I'm currently Diamond with them.  This hotel is everything the brand should stand for.  The hotel is exceptionally well located.  The rooms are a good size and well laid out.  The staff are polite and professional.  It's funky and classy and new.  The Executive Lounge is one of the best I have been to.  I liked every single thing about this hotel ... and I am a VERY PICKY customer when it comes to my hotel stays.  Stay here.  You won't be disappointed.  While you're at it, take a stroll across the street and enjoy the art at the Tate Modern.",5,2016,04,20
120,Easter Weekend stay,"My wife and Daughter checked in on Good Friday and I notified the hotel that it was my wife's birthday, not only did they supply a cake but also Easter eggs for them, without charge. I joined them on Sunday and was impressed with the level of service, attention to detail, the quality of the rooms and food,which was plentiful.
The staff were excellent, their attentiveness and attention to detail was some of the best I had witnessed anywhere in the world. This was the first time I had stayed at this hotel but it will not be the last. For those who like to keep fit, the gym was small but had sufficient equipment to cater for those who wished to use it and also a swimming pool that was inviting and spotless, with loungers alongside the pool",5,2016,04,20
120,Great location for South Bank and the City of London,"From our arrival to our departure, every staff member we came across was friendly and helpful. Our room was modern with very comfortable beds, full length mirror and a great bathroom and shower. Will definitely stay here again.",5,2016,04,20
120,"Great, cool hotel - coming back for sure :)","What a nice positive stay. Everything was fantastic from entering parking infront of hotel to I left hotel 2 days later. 
Staff was fantastic , smiling, knowledgeable and helpful. 
Hotel is modern ( newly opened ) , with smart modern design , great decor, clean, airy and welcoming in all ways .
Rooms are spacious , nice bed sizes ( even when you are 1,9 meter ), good airconditioning / heating , nice spacious barhrooms - so all great here .
Breakfast great - with good choice for most tastes - had dinner one night and also nice menu and good wine selection. 
Gym ok and bar/ lobby restaurant cool and busy.
For sure a hotel I will visit again, if I'm on south side - and did I mention that Tate modern is only 2 min away - milenium bridge 5 min away - cool area to explore - I'm really positively surpriced - and I'm not a normal Hilton guest - so well done - keep it up",4,2016,04,20
120,Beware the Hilton Pre Authorization.. and forget the Exec Lounge!,"I don't actually like to be too critical but I'm afraid I have to make the points below. Lovely hotel.. quiet room.. great location.. good staff.... great Breakfast .But..  and bear in mind the stay was £469 for one night with no additional food..

1) Pre - authorization of card.Usual pre-authorization of credit card on arrival but this was for the full stay so a significant sum. I paid in full on check out only to note on my bank statement later in the week that the pre-authorized sum had actually been debited as well as the check out settlement and had been taken from my available bank funds. Had to contact hotel and get them to cancel the transaction. Same thing has happened to friends at other Hilton hotels. So when you check out make sure they have cancelled the Pre-Authorization.

2) Booked a Suite for 3 only to find the sofa bed made up as a double bed in the small lounge area and dominating it at 1 pm in the afternoon. Can't understand for the life of me why we weren't asked when we wanted the sofa converted.

3) Lights tripped out!

4) Exec Lounge. Nice design but couldn't find much else to recommend it. Alcoholic drinks and food minimal compared to other hotels and the Lounge member of staff was always prowling around like we were messing his system up. Did not feel comfortable and did not bother with it. Certainly not worth having breakfast or lunch there. Not a good comparison with other hotel lounges ..guess why it was empty.

5) Paid a small upgrade fee for a high floor as expected some sort of view .. there was ...of buildings and the railway track.

6) Bar staff preoccupied with mixing cocktails for a small group and service very slow.

7) Trying to get another key card when I left mine in the room was difficult even though I showed them the debit card I had paid for the room on. Crazy request for a passport in my own country!

8) No prices shown for Mini Bar and they are heavy ..£10 for a miniature!

There you go .. just saying!!!!
Phew",4,2016,04,20
120,"Luxury weekend, stunning hotel","Friendly, helpful staff, amazing food, stunning room with flatscreen tv and surround sound. swimming pool and fitness suite.excellent location just two stops on tube to Westminster. We didn't want to leave and will definitely go back. ",5,2016,04,20
120,Great London hotel,"I took my husband here for his 50th birthday as we were visiting friends who live in that area. I had mentioned when I wanted a slightly earlier check in that it was my husbands birthday and we needed to be somewhere else. The staff at check in were lovely. For a London hotel this is great and in a good location. The room was a large size although the view to the other rooms wasn't great but then it's London so I didn't expect much.
When we got back in the evening after celebrating with friends, the hotel had kindly left a chocolate cake with happy birthday wrote on the plate in our room with a little card. This was a lovely touch and I would like to thank whoever did this.
Breakfast the next day was amazing, loved it. It's a great hotel which I will definitely recommend for holidays and business. We will definitely be back. ",5,2016,04,20
120,Recent stay,"I don't think I've ever encountered a friendlier staff at a Hilton property. Alberto is top notch! The male concierges were very helpful. Ricardo, the chef in the morning was very good and fun. Breakfast was unbelievably great. The only thing I didn't like was the lack of a real window in my room. I think prison cells have bigger windows than the one in my room.",4,2016,04,18
120,Pleasant stay in London,Very helpful and nice stuff. Quiet rooms with excellent beds. The show of the barkeepers is the best I ever seen. Very good  drinks and nice ambient. The location of the hotel is perfect to see many places by walking and the underground is just a few blocks away.,5,2016,04,18
120,One of the finest in the chain....,"One of the best Hiltons I have had the pleasure of visiting.  Great location for Central London with Southwark tube a 4 minute walk away.  The hotel is an easy 20 minute walk into Westminster along the Thames, which is a lovely walk.

The hotel has a well equipped gym and pool.  The staff are outstanding and I have rarely seen a better trained and happy bunch.

The rooms are really nice and a good size.  The bathrooms are also well designed and fresh.  

The bar area is really good and they do high-end cocktails with a well stocked gin bar.  The bar staff the night I was in coped well with a sudden influx of customers.  

The breakfast was outstanding and again the exec lounge staff were friendly, pleasant and professional.

Overall an absolute credit to the brand.  Ill be back in a few weeks and cant wait.",5,2016,04,18
120,Beautiful and quiet. ,"I loved this hotel. It's very new and sleek which may not appeal to everyone but the room (I had a king) was delightful; spacious and with everything you think you would need for a couple of days stay and even some things you didn't think you did. 

The bathroom and shower were superb, I loved the ability to turn up the tv volume in the bathroom so while I was in the shower I could continue to hear the news or listen to the radio. 

The staff were friendly and helpful, and nothing seemed to be too much trouble. The hotel is in a fantastic location, just a few minutes from Borough Market and Bankside and there's a bus at the end of the street that will take you to Covent Garden and the Theatre district. The bar is sleek and the cocktail list extensive, the drinks are a little overpriced but I've come to expect that of most city hotel bars. 

I can't wait to go back to the Bankside. ",5,2016,04,17
120,Fabulous Staff!,"Despite only staying one night we loved the ambience of the hotel. The staff were all polite and lovely, and after seeing the menu we decided to dine in the restaurant. Matteo was our superb host - nothing was too much trouble and he was able to recommend great wines to compliment our chosen meals, which was of an excellent standard and absolutely delicious.

Thank you for making our weekend with friends one to remember. ",5,2016,04,17
120,Excellent value for money for a 5 star hotel in London,"This is the most stylish Hilton we've ever stayed in.  The entrance lobby is huge and very nicely decorated.  Our room was enormous - very wide bed and a large showeroom.  The hotel is very stylish throughout, and there's a large bar and restaurant, both of which were fairly quiet.  The OXBO restaurant seems to offer good value set menus and Sunday lunches.

One thing that's fairly odd is the mini-bar arrangement.  For some reason, the mini-bar is completely empty and you have to call Housekeeping if you want anything put in it.  Service was a tiny bit hit-and-miss during our stay for some of the smaller items such as water and tea in the room.

In terms of location, it's roughly 10 minutes to Borough Market if you fancy a street food breakfast or a cup of hot mulled cider (or you could try both together like we did!).",5,2016,04,17
120,Nice New Hilton,"First stay here after previously visiting the restaurant. Good check-in with an hhonors upgrade. Nice modern room, spacious, clean (as you would hope for a new property). Complimentary mineral water and fruit in the room.

Good service in the bar, although the food wasn't particularly notable. Slightly disappointing in the Exec Lounge the following night as the canapes were removed quite early compared with other properties - 19:30, so I missed pigging out on cheese and biscuits!

A slightly strange blip when I was phoned on the morning of my second day to ask whether I'd checked out ""because housekeeping said the room was empty."" I had a shirt hanging in the wardrobe and all my smalls and other accoutrements in a drawer.

On the whole though, I will be staying again - very handy for work and a nice comfortable hotel.",4,2016,04,17
120,Modern & New,"Great new hotel in Southwark area, stayed 3 nights. Rooms are all renovated & modern, hotel itself is lovely. Service is awesome, especially the concierge. The view from some rooms are not at all interesting. The neighbourhood is overall good, close to walk to Borough Market & Tate Modern, although the fastest way to walk to the subway is indirect through a small neighborhood and area is mostly offices. Overall I would return + recommend.",4,2016,04,16
120,Special place to stay,"I stayed for nights on business this week. What a fabulous hotel!! Everything about the stay was superb. Spacious twin room (large single beds), huge walk in shower. It was very quiet, well furnished with everything I needed. I ate in the OXBO restaurant which served a good selection of grills and fish. I chose the £25 table d'hote which was great value and a delicious 3 courses with half a bottle of fizz. 

The hotel is near the Tate Modern, Borough Market, The Shard and London Bridge a very busy area but it was such a calm place to stay away from all the bustle outside.  

All positive but what made this hotel so special was the staff. I travel quite a lot for business and pleasure and the staff in this hotel were all exceptional. Every one of them was friendly.  They smiled, greeted me, asked if they could help, nothing seemed too much trouble - amazing. 

I will definitely stay there again",5,2016,04,16
120,This Should Be The Future of Hilton,"Modern, cool, trendy & slick? Not something normally associated with Hiltons. Think again. The Hilton Bankside is (don’t be put off) kind of like a grown up W Hotel but way better & not as tragically hip. Excellent open inviting lobby, efficient (if cold & mechanical) check-in. Rooms are beautifully furnished & functional. Our King Executive was great. Everything was where it should be & of a high quality. Only thing missing was a bath - just a shower, sadly. The executive lounge was nicer than many 5 star hotel lounges we have visited - great service & decent food & beverages.

We dined in OXBO for dinner one evening - great service BUT the food? Not so good. The food in the bar was also just average. Overcooked burger, cold fries etc. This really detracts from the rest of the hotel experience & needs to be addressed.

Overall, rates permitting, we will look to make this our go-to London address when in town. More of the same please Hilton!",5,2016,04,16
120,Weekend away,"My boyfriend booked the hotel as a surprise, and we decided to stay the weekend between both of our Birthday's and just after our anniversary. I mentioned the joint Birthday and anniversary, but did not get any extra treatment as I've read further below. However the hotel was beautiful, very clean and stylish, and I loved the fragrance wafting through reception as you walk in! The male staff member who greeted us was very friendly, welcoming and helpful, it's just a shame that I didn't get time to spend more time there so I could use more of the amenities such as the gym. The rooms are really lovely, the bed was very large and comfortable, and the bathroom was a particular favourite with nice products to use, and a nice big shower. I thought it was a nice touch that the room was freshened up while we went out for the evening, and a mat left at the side of the bed with slippers. I would like to say I had a restful sleep, but we were woken by a loud repeated drilling noise early on the Saturday morning which was annoying! Sunday morning we were startled awake by a fire alarm going off in the building at 4.15am, and something that can only be described as sounding like a spaceship taking off outside the room over and over!  It was a pretty distressing experience in honesty. Not ideal as we ended up sleeping in later and not getting chance to see as much as we wanted to. I would obviously have mentioned my concern to the reception upon leaving, however we were not asked how our stay was. I can tell you I loved it, but such a shame about the noise.",4,2016,04,15
120,Anniversary Treat,"The whole Hilton Bankside experience is wonderful, whether a tourist or on business.  We actually live in London and it was still a fantastic place to escape too, whilst being in reach of everything that London and the South Bank in particular has to  offer.  Hilton Bankside has some lovely twists and really offers a designer feel.  Great bar and restaurant, superb new rooms and bathrooms - I cannot recommend it more highly!",5,2016,04,14
120,OXBO.... Very Nice Choice For Business Lunch,"This, somewhat hidden, gem is easily missed due to it's location but it was one of the best business lunch venues we have used so far so I recommend you make the effort to find it... we loved it here... what a treat!!

The decor when you arrive is fantastic. Lots of large (fake) animal heads in the room with amusing signage. The restaurant itself is big enough to accommodate large groups and yet cosy enough for our small group to feel comfortable. It was also extremely well managed by all of the staff on duty.

The kitchen area is interesting so I recommend a table close enough to see the chefs at work. The quality of the food was excellent, it really is a hidden gem. We were impressed with the menu and took the lunch time set option - 3 courses for £21 including a very nice glass of wine. Cheaper options are available but this was great.
We plugged our laptops in easily and stayed for quite a long time after coffee which was very welcomed. Thank you Hilton. It's touches like this that make us come back.

Everybody's starter and main arrived hot and looked amazing. Everybody ate everything but what I wanted to draw attention to is the ease with which the staff dealt with a request from one of our diners (important client). She couldn't eat dairy so she was struggling with the set menu dessert option. The waitress was very kind and said she would mention it to the chef. He created a trio of jelly desserts with a rich fruit sorbet on the side... it was better than everyone else's!!!  How lovely!!

I have dined with Hilton (and used their hotels) for many years and I have to say that  I often find Hilton in any country to be a bit unaccommodating but the London Bankside has hit magic with the team here.  I will be recommending you to all of my marketing and event friends.",4,2016,04,14
120,Amazing hotel and location,"From the moment we checked on we where impressed. The service from the staff was lovely minus the emails where I kept being called Ms when them assumed the name Nathaniel was a female.

The hotel was first class kept so clean and the bedrooms where really nice. We had a twin room and the beds where a decent size.

Location wise it was perfect 5 minutes from Southwark tube station and 5 minutes from the river front. 

Will be coming back for sure. ",5,2016,04,13
120,As good as it looks!,"This Hilton is spectacular. It's definitely worth the high reviews it's getting - really great modern and new hotel that is currently a great deal for the price. The rooms are large, beds are comfortable, great showers and toiletries.   They also have a great selection of restaurants and bars, plus friendly staff.  To top it off I was impressed by the fitness center - there is a really lovely pool and hot tub in the basement that I could have spent hours in.  Come!",5,2016,04,12
120,"Fantastic room, wonderful service but a bit pricey","I booked the Hilton for the good lady and I for my birthday weekend. The room was absolutely fantastic and I could have stayed in bed all day (which is unusual). The service from everyone was truly wonderful and first class. The room itself was good value and we could have got slightly cheaper but nowhere near as great a bed i am sure :) The breakfast and the bar were a little pricey. I would describe them as London plus, which means about 20% more than the prices you pay in most places in big cities like London anyway. However don't let this take away from the fact that the room, service and quality of the place was truly excellent. The location was good and about 0.5 miles from 3 underground stops. Great location for visiting the Tate, Globe, Shard and for Borough Market which was a first visit for us.",4,2016,04,12
120,Excellent,"Very new feel to this hotel, very well located just off the river and within a short walk of Blackfriars station and several London attractions (Tate Modern, Shard, Borough Market etc). Large modern rooms with superb bathrooms and v comfy beds, quality linen, large TV etc. Small but functional gym and a nice indoor pool. Great service throughout the hotel. Breakfast was standard Hilton buffet-style. Relaxing ground-floor bar was a nice place to unwind. Recommended. ",4,2016,04,12
120,Ultra modern new build hotel,"My second visit here, and both have been excellent. Very spacious rooms with all the amenties provided for a comfortable stay including efficient adjustable air conditioning. Excellent soundproofing and comfortable beds mean a good sleep is assured. Breakfast is of a very good standard although insufficient cutlery provided (only one knife). Friendly staff ensure a most pleasurable stay.",5,2016,04,11
120,Excellent Hotel with great staff,"We stayed over in London after a show and visiting some friends and booked this hotel a few weeks in advance.

The staff are excellent and friendly and the hotel décor is modern and gives the hotel a very classy feel. We upgraded to a superior room for a good price and were not left disappointed. The bed was very comfy and the shower was amazing. Also the complimentary mini bar was a great touch.

The breakfast was much more than your usual 'buffet' with the chefs cooking fresh pancakes and eggs on demand.

I have stayed in a few hotels in the area with work but this was by far the best.",5,2016,04,11
120,Seasoned traveller,"If you need to be south side of the river you must stop here!  Lovely hotel, fab staff, near the Globe, Tate, Shard and Borough Market and my office.  You'll love the exec lounge, bedrooms/showers are great.  CG",5,2016,04,11
120,Our stay in London ,"I must say we enjoyed our short trip to London. Busy as it was, the history and information I absorbed was brilliant and worth the time spent walking and tubing to get there!  The hotel is close to most major attractions but bare in mind 6 days minimum is needed to be able to stop and smell the roses. We did a lot in 3 days and I wished we had more time. 

The hotel manager, Per, was my absolute favourite man to talk with. He was friendly, helpful, kind and funny. And Swedish no less, we had that in common 😊 He really made us feel welcomed here. We are down to earth people that like nice things but appreciate how much time and effort that must go into keeping everybody happy!   The executive room was wonderful. We had tea and breakfast each morning and it was spot on. High tea was also pleasant. Nice desserts and again I must mention the tea. Excellent, every pot!  We enjoyed what they had to offer and the servers were kind and pleasant. I would recommend this hotel and especially Per. You may tell him Alana sent you!  ",4,2016,04,11
120,Excellent hotel for a business trip,"We stayed in this hotel for 6 nights.  Extremely friendly, efficient and helpful staff.  Great breakfast but very busy.  Excellent restaurant and well visited bar with nice atmosphere.  Neat and tidy but very dark room and not a lot of wardrobe space.  Great mattress.  A good hotel with full comfort to stay on a business trip but not ideal to relax.",5,2016,04,10
120,Little Gem,"We had a week in London shopping and sight seeing while meeting our son that lives n London. I have stayed in Hiltons often we travel extensively and I would have to say our experience at this hotel was great the staff were friendly, helpful and location to the Southbank was terrific. I would stay here again and would highly recommend this hotel for business or leisure.",5,2016,04,10
120,Simply superb!,"Very new, staff is excellent - we arrived early but got a room immediately. An example of hospitality and readiness to go extra mile to make guests happy - we went out in the evening and came back to a cleaned room with the bed prepped for the night - even slippers were put next to the bed ;)! 
The location of the hotel is very convenient - short walk to the tube, 5 minutes to Tate Modern and a nice walk cross the Millenium Bridge to magnificent St. Paul's.",5,2016,04,10
120,Nice Hotel if you don't mind a bit more travel,"If you have time and don't mind an extra bit of travel to the west end the Hilton Bankside offers a refreshing option. Located behind the Tate Modern and 5 minutes from the Globe Threatre its location isn't bad but evening pursuits were not quite limited and its not that convenient to pop back to the hotel. Inside, the hotel is new and the lobby is functional. There is a great bar with snacks and a great dining room for breakfast, lunch and dinner. Room was also nice with one of the best beds I have slept in. The room was new, very clean and a nice size in case you need to work.",4,2016,04,10
120,Excellent place to stay,"From the minute We arrived the staff could not be nicer. The person who checked us in could not have been more helpful and welcoming . The beds were so comfortable and It was very clean and safe, the staff truly just wanted you to enjoy your stay. Would definitely go back again.",5,2016,04,09
120,Excellence,"Just stayed on a one night business trip and was amazed at the service and quality of the hotel.  THe location was great too.  Short walk to the Tate, OXO tower, London bridge and the city or a more leisurely stroll to the west end.  Avoid taxis over the bridge at the moment though because you'll just sit in traffic.  Take a 3 man walk to the tube at Southwark instead!!
We were treated very well, right from the go and upgraded complimentary to a one bed suite on the top floor with a fab view of the shard and London skyline.
Quality of the appointments and rooms is very high and the food we had in both the business center and the restaurant for breakfast was superb.  The quality and choice of the breakfast buffet was among the best I have experience.
Staff couldn't do enough for you and overall I would say this hotel is a credit to the brand.  Great comfort, service and location.  Highly recommended for business, couples and family stays.",5,2016,04,09
120,Perfect,"Perfect hotel for our family 3 night stay in London. Booked 3 rooms, all of which were very well appointed and spotlessly clean.  Staff friendly and efficient.  Would definitely stay again without hesitation.  Only downside is the traffic chaos that London is suffering at present due to the road/train/bike lanes being built, making the traditional Black Cabs extremely expensive due to detours!",5,2016,04,08
120,Modern and beautiful hotel in central London,"Nice hotel! Very good service! Special thanks to Per Granström and his crew!He made our stay very nice with guiding to Londons sites and made us feel comfortable. High professional performance!
Can recommend the launch at the hotel as well! Cosily!",5,2016,04,08
120,Loved the hotel! ,"Loved the hotel and the service! Special thanks to receptionist Per Granström! He helped us whit whatever we needed, restaurants, city guiding, sightseeing tips! He was so helpful! The hotel was very clean and the rooms where really nice! ",5,2016,04,08
120,Weekend trip,"We visited London early april and had a really great time at the Hilton London Bankside. Great service throughout the hotel, and exceptionally great service in the executive lounge. 
A special thank you to Per Granström who made our stay to a special memory!",5,2016,04,08
120,Outstanding service!,"My husband, niece and I spent three nights over Easter and had a terrific time.  Husband is a Diamond member, and we were very happy to be upgraded from a junior suite to a one bedroom suite.  We really appreciated the extra powder room.

The room was well appointed, clean and very comfortable.  Loved that many of the snacks in the refrigerator were complimentary.  We received a beautiful chocolate gift from the Easter bunny.

Executive lounge was nice, especially the afternoon tea snacks.  Breakfast in the restaurant was terrific.

Overall, we felt very pampered by the excellent service.  Kudos to the staff for their warm displays of friendliness and hospitality.  We would definitely stay again.",5,2016,04,08
120,Great Hotel and Great Staff,"My wife and I had booked this hotel as a package through British Airways.  While traveling I was praying that the hotel would be good, as some Hilton Hotels in the US can be sketchy depending where you go.  When we arrived I was amazed at how beautiful the hotel is.  The hotel so incredibly modern I felt comfortable the moment I walked in.  The standard room is also modern with beautiful styling and fixtures.  Having such a nice room made calling it a night easy because everything is taken care of.  New water is placed by each nightstand and complementary slippers are placed by you bed.  

The best part of our stay was the staff.  Everyone was very friendly and helpful.  We felt as if we were VIPs staying in the most expensive room. I felt as if I was talking to good friends when interacting with the staff, any question or concern we had was taken care of in moments and made out trip stress free.

On my next trip to London I will stay at this hotel.  I left with such a good vibe that Hilton London Bankside is my hotel of choice.  

This hotel is well located in Southwark.  You are a short walk or tube ride to all the sights in London, but you are away from the busy London hotels.   I hope this quick review helps anyone trying to decide on booking this hotel for their stay.  It is a great place and you will enjoy your stay.",5,2016,04,08
120,Very friendly and helpful staff,"Ricky the head barman is a charming character and very helpful. He has an amazing memory for names, drinks etc. His Shakespeare cocktails were inspired. In fact all bar staff were really friendly. A sticking bathroom door was fixed as soon as it was reported. The proximity to Shakespeare's Globe Theatre is a big plus.",5,2016,04,08
120,"Great Hotel, Great Service","Stayed here for a conference which meant the hotel was extremely busy and lots of people trying to check in at unusual times. But none of this seemed to phase the staff. Cases were accepted and correctly delivered, someone even came during the evening to close my curtains and leave me some slippers and a bottle of water. The room was a good size and the bed very comfortable. Breakfast was excellent. Can't fault any of it, I would definitely stay here again.",5,2016,04,08
120,Excellent bar service,"I spent a lovely evening with my friends at the bar. The head bartender Riccardo and the waitress were great, very polite and  helpful, cocktails and finger food were delicious. Overall great atmosphere, I will definitely come back and I would recommend this hotel to everyone.",5,2016,04,07
120,Very good experience,"I really appreciated my trip in this hotel.  The team was nice, the room two, the location is good with many shops and restaurants in the same street. The breakfast is soooo nice and everybody is kind !",5,2016,04,07
120,Great location and good discount through Trip Advisor,"We booked through Trip Advisor's mobile app, after realising that a 25% discount applied through the app (not the case for iPad or laptop). We paid only £123 per night, which was amazing value for a 5 star hotel with a great location. 

Nearest tube is Southwark, only a 5 minute walk away. There are some good bars just on Southwark Street (try Camino for great tapas). 

Rooms were very smart but also very dark, with little natural light. Bathroom was great.  Breakfast is £25 unless you book in advance. We had already booked breakfast at the Ivy Cafe in Marylebone, which was good value and a great experience.   

The lighting system in the rooms is also a little confusing. It took us a while to establish how to ensure that the bathroom light would turn on in the night (there is a night light button next to the beds).  Turn down service on an evening was a nice touch. Free wifi for the first 24 hours. 

We had a few drinks in the bar. Yes they are a little pricey but we thought they were reasonable for London. As said above, there is plenty of choice elsewhere. 

Would definitely stay here again.",4,2016,04,07
120,Excellent hotel,"We stayed here for two nights - the first weekend in April.  The location, a few minutes walk from Southwark tube station  is excellent - Tate Modern, St Paul's Cathedral, Borough Market and The Shard are all easy walks. The hotel is new and everything is immaculate.  Lots of staff to welcome you and ""call the lift"" - customer service was very good and there was a 'turn down service' in the evening.   We had a good sized room with a very comfort super-king bed,robes, slippers, fridge etc - the en-suite was excellent - very large walk in shower with waterfall shower and good water pressure. Because we were visiting family who live nearby we did not eat in the hotel and we did not have the time to try the leisure facilities but hopefully we will again on a future visit. We booked over 3 months ahead and got a very good deal and if we can repeat this, Hilton Bankside will definitely be our hotel of choice when we visit London.",5,2016,04,07
120,Great New Hotel,"Stayed in the Hilton Bankside for a weekend break in London. The location is great, walkable to Waterloo station and and most places in central London, if you like walking. Check in was busy but the queue moved fast and staff were apologetic. The room was a good size and very modern with excellent bathroom facilities. This is definitely one of the nicer Hiltons that I have stayed in over the past few years.We did not eat in the hotel as it seemed very over priced for what was on offer so we chose to venture elsewhere. It was a lovely bonus to have a pool although the water was extremely chilly which took away some of the enjoyment! Wouldn't hesitate to stay again.",4,2016,04,06
120,Top hotel,"Stayed two nights here on Bed and breakfast basis.   We had a Kingsize Executive Room which allows access to the Executive Lounge.   The room had everything we needed and probably one of the best showers ever.   Plenty of towels and lovely robes all added to experience.
Afternoon tea in the lounge was very welcome, great to rest legs and recharge batteries.  The food was wonderful.  Very fresh and replaced as needed.   
Continental breakfast is served in the lounge.  We had however chosen to enjoy the full breakfast in the restaurant.  The range of dishes was wonderful, amongst the best I have had.  I suspect the selection in the lounge would have been good.   Certainly I spotted a few guests leaving with fruit overflowing from bags.  
The staff were so helpful, happy and beautifully dressed.   Nothing was too much trouble and it seemed our every need had been anticipated.  
Drinks are not cheap but that's not unusual in hotels.   
We ate in the restaurant one evening and enjoyed a perfectly cooked meal accompanied by a carafe of house Argentinian Malbec.   Delicious.  
A few minutes walk to the Jubilee line which provides excellent access for passengers
Would strongly recommend this hotel and location.",5,2016,04,06
120,Good,"Great hotel, service however room service let it down. Actually that is wrong the level of food served at room service let it down as the service was very good.  Bar also excellent in the lobby. Beds comfortable and room size was great considering location.",4,2016,04,05
120,Great New Hotel,"Really good value for money hotel close to the Tate Modern. Outstanding facilities, friendly staff and well presented room. Used the pool facilities which were also finished to a very high standard.

Anthony on reception was very helpful and went out of his way to make us feel welcome (despite being a Gooner!)",5,2016,04,04
120,Birthday weekend! ,"We've never stayed in the area before but was very pleased with the location and the nearby transportation access and good places to visit in the area.
The room was clean and quiet with really nice contemporary design. Very helpful and service minded staff with cudos to Per (reception) who was absolutely perfect!",4,2016,04,04
120,Diamond in the rough,The hotel looks modern from the outside and unassuming in the inside.  The Staff at all levels are eager to help and strive to resolve your problems. It located not far from Southwark (Jubilee line) and less than 7 mins to the river. I particularly like the option to check in and pick my room before my arrival. But I was distracted on arrival and agreed to change my room.  This hotel has inward facing and street facing rooms. Be sure to ask for rooms facing the street for my room looked out to rooms that were roughly twelve feet from my window.,4,2016,04,03
120,One of the nicest hotel stays in a long time!,"TOP MARKS. Stayed for 2 nights this week and thought I should take the time to post a nice review. Spot on. Lovely hotel, excellent staff, awesome :-)

Looks like it's pretty new, everything was super clean and modern, room very comfortable, quiet, v nice bed, great blackout curtains. Every single member of staff we encountered was super pro, from the cleaners, to front desk staff, doorman, and the bar staff (was really impressed with the super-italian barman - meant to get his name to send a special thank you - so Hilton bosses if you're reading this, look him up and give him a high five from us!).

Will absolutely be coming back and staying again if we need to be in the area overnight. Respect.",5,2016,04,03
120,Surprisingly good and modern. ,"Hilton properties can tend to be a little hit and miss, and yet this one is modern, spacious and the service from the reception/concierge manager was prompt, efficient and very friendly. Room was clean, modern and quiet. Bed was firm but comfortable and linens crisp and clean. Breakfast served in a thoroughly well designed room which managed to feel boutique and yet spacious. Kudos to the breakfast chefs for perfect poached eggs and great coffee. Will definitely stay here again.",4,2016,04,02
120,High Class Hotel,"I stayed at Bankside in September as part of a trip to London with some friends.  I was a bit unsure at first as it was the first week that the hotel had opened but it was soon apparent from the excellent pre-stay service that I received from Per and the warm welcome that I had from the staff on my arrival this is definitely a hotel that knows what the important things are and strives to do them very well.   

The food and drink that we had was very good indeed (although a bit pricey) and the room was very smart indeed.   The ""city view"" of a set of roadworks left a bit to be desired and the pool area was yet to be opened but that did not detract from what was a fantastic experience from start to finish.",4,2016,04,01
120,great location great staff,"Had a great stay, can't say too many good things about this place. It was faultless.  The room was spotless, the facilities excellent.  The breakfast was fit for 2 men with hangovers,   Bar closed too early though, but there was only me and my colleague in it.",5,2016,03,30
120,Friendly Staff,"We have stayed in London on numerous occasions, and have probably been in at least 25 hotels there. The staff at this particular hotel were probably the friendliest staff we have encountered anywhere. This, in addition to the fantastic location if one has plans to be in the Southwark area (Tate Modern, Globe, Old Vic, Royal Festival Hall, the Borough Market, etc.), is cause for us to book there again.",5,2016,03,30
120,Sad points and good points,"Lets start with the good points. Suprisingly easy transport with Tube and Bus nearby as well at Rail and ferry. Warm welome from staff and easy very early checkin.The pool was quiet for our swim the bext day . Most of the staff were fine and rooms were cleaned and turndown daily.
Quiet it is, carpeted hall ways and not a sound from adjacent rooms.
Lifts plentiful  and well secured with a room card system. Thank goodness for the new card rreaders ,Just place key against fob and your in.
Now the sad bits 
On arrival our room smelt a bit odd but as we were going out we left it in the hope it would waft away. On return this smell was very strong and we called the desk , they sent a maintenance man very promptly who decided we needed a room move. night manager came and we had a couple of rooms to try, the first one had the same smell but the second one was fine and we settled in. Slept like babies
Next day down to breakfast and were very disappointed at the service , value and offering.
 On arrival taken to table and then .............not a lot happened, no offer of tea. coffee , no menu given so not really aware of the choices for the £25 per person cost. Went to get some juice, none labeled ,so after a bit of guess work got the juice, on returning to the table , still no drink offer. Lurking staff but no action.
Went off to get the porridge, looked for brown sugar? Asked staff and they said its on the table . Cubes yes but not useful for porridge! Eventually it came from the kitchen. Then went to buffet, Bacon, sausage, mushrooms, grilled tomatoes, cubed pots and scrambled egg. No beans, no black pudding, no offer for kippers.,haddock, poached egg, boiled eggs etc. They may have been available but it was not easy to find out if there were even avaiklable. Cold buffet was fair .
It seems there is a ""lets flog the buffet "" system in place.In my mind this is a poor show for the money.In addition the bacon was cool and the scrambled eggs not a good taste.
Took it back to table with toast and found only one knife. If you are eating breakfast and toast on the side you need two knives. Called a waiter and asked for another knive, he went away and proceeded to ignore my request . Eventually went and found him  and he was creating table places and very grudgingly offered me a knive, not the correct size.Back to the table and finished the main, went to get some more bread, there was none and no plates . Called staff , again, and had some bread, during this time the table was not cleared , again lurking waiter so put it on the next table. No offer to replenish the tea or coffee..
Altogether not a good start to the day and it could have been so much better.
Decided to mention it to the Manager and after a great day out called down to discuss it. Very understanding lady and the next day things were better with more action from the staff but still did not get a good vibe overall and none of the above choices shown
Swimming pool was great, very quiet but surprisingly no sauna or steam room. there appeared to be room for it, as for the towels, they must have been the smallest towels I have ever had at an hotel pool You needed two or three to get dry.
Checkout was easy as prepaid and did not try the bar or restaurant so no extras.
Overall a pleasant place to stay but soem dissapoiuntment with the room and especially the breakfast. 
Would I stay again ? Yes just make sure the room smelt OK on entering and if it was room only then thats fine.",3,2016,03,29
120,An experience on its own!,"We just spent a perfect night in this Hilton hotel and it was brilliant! 
The room was lovely, nice decor and clean.
Staff were cheerful, polite and very accommodating. They were spoiling us with extras like complimentary chocolate cake (for our anniversary), Easter eggs, snacks, bottled water, slippers etc. We thought it was a nice touch, which made us feel special and welcome.
For breakfast we were offered high-quality products, none of the greasy pale sausages served in too many places! We enjoyed it a lot.
I definitely recommend this hotel and will be returning.",5,2016,03,29
120,Birthday trip,"Had a night at the aquarium booked & wanted a hotel nearby, obviously lots of choice but truly happy with my choice. Staff were incredibly polite & helpful even to the doorman. Lots of nice little touches including birthday cake being brought up. The restaurant was lovely & had an exquisite meal.",5,2016,03,29
120,Great property near commercial area,"We stayed here for a 2-night stop in Europe.  The property was beautiful!  It's pretty new and the décor is creative.  Upon check-in, we had an issue with our reservation.  Unfortunately, the Front Desk person (said she was the Supervisor) felt no need to help us solve it.  Her basic attitude was ""your reservation is lost ...bye.""  She didn't offer another room, didn't offer to accommodate us in any way.  Basically wanted us to go away and come back if we were able to resolve it.  My companion had to ask about another room.  She said yes, but only at a higher rate than what we were paying (one check on the website showed a rate lower than what she claimed was the only one available).  The fact that the reservation was for a Hilton Honors member did not seem to matter to her at all.  After my companion did some internet research we were able to secure a room at the hotel.  It would have been nice if the Front Desk had done that.  Check out was much nicer.  The hotel was quiet.  We didn't really hear any noise from the hallway.  Both evenings the maid knocked to offer turn down service.  The restaurants seem kind of ""non-casual"" so we didn't take advantage, but they looked beautiful.",4,2016,03,28
120,Very good hotel,"Brand new hotel very centrally located. The design and furnishings have been well thought out and make the hotel enjoyable to be in. For those used to Hilton hotels you may be astonished by the level of service offered from the friendliness of the staff to the service in the restaurant and executive lounge, which was more reminiscent of Hiltons in Asia. The bedrooms are well laid out and function well, there is even turndown service. I like the location in an area of London that is developing and well connected.",5,2016,03,28
120,Great service and nice rooms,"I stay here for business and the staff are always extremely friendly and helpful on arrival. The rooms are fairly consistent, very comfortable beds, nice bathrooms with large walk in showers. The food can be a bit hit and miss but generally good. The breakfast spread can't be beaten. Lots to pick from and freshly made. Good gym although can be busy particularly at peak times. Good location, walking distance to some sights but also very near a tube station.",4,2016,03,27
120,Beautiful new hotel,"My wife is STILL talking about this place several months later. We stayed there literally the night it opened, which was a fun experience for a hotel. The rooms are very modern and well-appointed. As Hilton Diamond members, we had access to the lounge for breakfast, and my wife claims it's her favorite hotel breakfast so far. The tea was exceptional, as you'd expect for London, and they had a very high quality assortment of other options. The space itself was beautiful and we enjoyed our time there very much. She is already looking for an excuse to go back to London with a demand we stay here.",5,2016,03,27
120,Lovely hotel with friendly efficient staff,"We have just come back from a lovely stay at this hotel. The staff were very friendly and efficient. The hotel had Lovely decor. The breakfast was delicious and plenty of choice.

The hotel is about a ten minute walk from Waterloo tube station and we found this easier to get to than the Southwark station. 

We will definitely stay here on our next trip to London. ",5,2016,03,27
120,Hilton bankside ,"My partner and myself had a lovely stay here although we upgraded rooms which in its self was gorgeous the view was rubbish, luckily this had no bearing on our stay we enjoyed it all the staff were lovely and felt very approachable. Will definitely be staying here again... highly recommend the bed is out of this world comfortable too",5,2016,03,26
120,Easter Weekend,"On arrival at the hotel, myself and my 8 year old son were greeted by very helpful staff who showed us to our room and helped with our baggage. Rooms are very clean and lovely but the view overlooking a building next door and the only very small window did not even open.
No mirror by any plug sockets to get ready for an evening!
The pool is a great size and nice and warm but the jacuzzi is a few pointless jets. No staff on the pool reception to advise us on procedure or where to go etc.
This evening at 10pm I had house keeping try to enter my room because i did not answer the door when they knocked 3 times.....hello...myself and my young son are in bed!! I will not sleep great tonight now!
£10 for a medium sized glass of wine. Rip off. 
Not worthy of a 5 star. I will not stay here again. I stayed in the 4 star Hilton in Cardiff a few weeks back and found it a much more relaxed and pleasurable experience. ",3,2016,03,26
120,Family vacation with some rough spots!!,"Hotel is gorgeous- executive club is fantastic- all which should point to a high mark. Unfortunately rooms in our party were not cleaned and several attempted calls to front desk, housekeeping and concierge were unanswered. Maintenance man was sent to check our phone- and of course, the call was answered on the first ring.  Then we requested a very early wake up call only to be called  at 11p to confirm wake up call for 5:30.",2,2016,03,26
120,Outstanding Business Hotel,"This hotel does a wonderful job of catering to the business traveler.  It is conveniently located and is new with a very high quality of finish.  However, the Staff is what sets this property apart.  Rooms are high quality and comfortable.  Staff is very attentive.  Bar is outstanding.   Location is great being near Southbank, Waterloo, and the Southwark tube stop.",5,2016,03,26
120,Nice one night stay,"Nice hotel which is in a great location for the Tate (2 min) and Borough Market (10 min)

We had a king room which was not deluxe and unlike the reviewer below the room had a window with an outside view, it was of a wall but as we were not in the hotel room much this was not an issue.

The room was large and well equipped. Large walk in shower with good water pressure. bathrobes and slippers provided. Good toiletries. Bed and pillows were very comfortable.

I believe that were meant to have complementary water in the fridge but there was none provided, I am sure this would have been provided upon request if we had wanted.

Staff are very friendly. We had drinks in the bar early evening and also late evening when we returned from a evening out. The later evening service was a bit slow but again staff were polite and welcoming. Drinks were very nice although be prepared for London prices and an added service charge of 12.5% (discretionary)

We did not eat in the hotel but there are plenty of options nearby for lunch, dinner and breakfast. 

We have stayed in other hotels in this area and we would come back to this hotel but perhaps only when it had a special offer price like we did on this occasion 

",4,2016,03,26
120,Baffled by Rave Reviews,"Frankly baffled by all the rave reviews for this hotel. Some good points, but mostly negative experience.

Good points - 1. breakfast is excellent - probably the best hotel breakfast I've ever had. 2. Staff is exceedingly friendly and helpful.

Bad - the ""non-deluxe"" rooms face inwards towards one another, so not only no view whatsoever, but you're looking directly into your neighbour's room. They can see everything you're doing and vice versa. If you don't want to be observed while in your room only choice is to keep curtains drawn entire stay. When I complained, I was politely told that only ""deluxe"" rooms faced outwards towards the street and that I was welcome to upgrade in exchange for the upgrade fee. I declined and therefore was left with a very dark room with no view whatsoever. To even see a bit of sky I had to strain my neck upwards, otherwise there would have been no way to even see what the weather outside was like. Lack of sunlight isn't helped by modern, but very dark room furnishings - even on sunniest day room was lit like a cave. 
Next - shower - side of tub was so high I practically needed a step stool to get in and out of the shower. Once in, was very narrow - kept hitting my arms against sides while trying to shower. I do know some other rooms had wide walk-in showers - unless you're planning to take a bath, do yourself a favour and demand one of those rooms.
Next - my colleague (in another room) was shocked to find out that electrical outlet in bathroom would not allow hair appliance to be used. She felt that alone was reason not to return to this hotel.
Finally, the ""artwork"" on the walls of this hotel verges on creepy - severed animal heads mounted on the walls of the breakfast restaurant (very appetizing....) and macabre themed prints elsewhere. Avant garde for sure, but not the least bit welcoming.
It's a new, modern hotel in a nice area (close to underground, restaurants and shops), but frankly with all the hotels to choose from in London and in this area, can't imagine why I'd ever stay here again.",3,2016,03,24
120,Nice hotel not the greatest service.,"Stayed at this hotel as a short weekend break following our wedding prior to our honeymoon.
Rang the hotel a week prior to arrival to order some wine and chocolates for our room on arrival as a surprise treat for my husband. All confirmed by hotel and assured it would be in place when we arrived.
On arrival no wine or chocolates. Rang reception who claimed not to be aware even after I gave them the name of the person I'd spoken to.
Reception said they would send up straight away but 2hrs later no sign. We went out to dinner and wine etc was in our room when we got back.
However the plate the chocs were on had "" Happy Anniversary"" on it. Totally wrong as we only got married the day before as I had explained several times.
We told reception of the mistake and all we got was. Smile and a comment of ""Ohwell chocolates are chocolates"" not even an apology.
Other than that the stay was fine overall. Nice rooms, good restaraunt etc.
Bar staff a bit too much interested in looking good rather than serving. Took over 20 mins to get a drink on more than one occasion. Even though never more than 20 people in the bar at any one time. There were always at least four staff but really slow and a bit surly.
My overall impression of this place is a nice hotel but staff and service need improving. After all it's not the cheapest place to stay.
N.B. They still insisted on charging us the full price for the wine and chocs even after their error about the occasion :-(",4,2016,03,24
120,Stay in London with Comfort and very well located,"Excellent location, at walking distance to  Southwark Metro station. At walking distance to London Eye and all well known monuments and attractions in the area.
The hotel is very comfortable with all amenities a business or a tourist wish to have in a high standard hotel.
Prices, well it's London!",4,2016,03,24
120,Great Price but with a few drawbacks,"Pros-  Got great price off hotels.com(approx 150/night), close to Tate Modern and Globe and Borough Market, very expansive breakfast and free for gold members!

Cons-  small rooms, badly designed bathroom(shower pressure is weak and need to stand very close to the wall to be under the water), hotel not convenient to tube station(10min walk), area not as vibrant as west end with fewer restaurants in the vicinity",3,2016,03,23
120,Pretty to look at not good to stay,"Stayed here for 1 night whilst working in London. 
Fantastic reception, check in was very below average with the need to ask for upgrade which is rather embarrassing given how quiet the hotel was. 
Frustrating thing is that there's a key required for the lift and staff don't help with your baggage. 
I am a diamond member and got upgraded to a junior suite. It wasn't great. No opening windows instead air con. 
Bed was standard bed. Toilet was a good size new but not practical the door opens straight to the toilet. 
Breakfast was in the exec lounge and it was extremely poor. 
Overall a very average hotel there are other Hilton brands if like me your loyal. ",2,2016,03,23
120,"Great hotel, luxury and attention to detail.","Stayed here overnight. The hotel itself is great, very modern, spotless and very friendly staff. 
We had cocktails in the bar, with waiter very welcoming with just enough chat. 
Breakfast spread was great, plenty of choice with allergies catered for.
Hotel is located well for bankside and is one of the better in Hilton's in the chain.",5,2016,03,23
120,Almost perfect ,"I stayed here recently and enjoyed one of the junior suites. 
On arrival I was met at the desk by a very polite and professional receptionist, was promptly checked in and offered help with my bags.
The suite was on the 1st floor and was incredible: all the comforts one would expect and more. The executive lounge was stunning and the service and food excellent. 
I had a thoroughly restful sleep and my stay at the hilton was only let down by the shower flooding the bathroom unexpectedly which made it rather tricky to safely get out and I had to spend some time drying the floor. 
Breakfast and checkout was a breeze. 

In summary I would thoroughly recommend the hilton at bankside despite the minor inconvenience with the shower. ",4,2016,03,21
120,"Amazing hotel, Conrad style","A true gem in the portfolio of Hilton!! Will make this my first choice of hotels in London. Friendly staff, fabulous room (519, no shard view but stylish, fresh and amazing bathroom. This hotel is even better then most Conrads I've stayed at. Food at executive lounge was not the greatest but the ""fire place"" and friendly staff made up for it! Can't wait to see the penthouse suite in July!!",5,2016,03,20
120,One Of The Best,"Wow what a great hotel the Hilton Bankside is. We have stayed in many Hilton hotels  but this was right up there with the best. Modern comfortable rooms, quality breakfast, superb executive lounge and great service from happy friendly staff. This is a newly opened hotel but I can see it creeping up the rankings on Tripadvisor over the coming months. Wish more Hiltons were run like this one. Looking forward to returning again soon.",5,2016,03,20
120,great hotel for business stay,I checked in late at night for a quick stay on business. Lovely girl on reception trying to make  small talk and wasn't getting the gist that in was tired... I had a twin room but the bed was massive and the hotel was probably one of the nicest well decorated and trendy rooms I have had the pleasure to stay in! I would stay again on a special but wouldn't pay rack rate - because you don't need too! ,4,2016,03,19
120,Impeccable from start to finish,"I stayed on Thursday 17th March with a work colleague. First impressions were fantastic, decor is beautifully finished and lots of fresh flowers in reception. Very stylish throughout. Check in excellent, despite us arriving 2 hours early they had a room available. Good sized rooms, quite masculine in style but very modern and stylish. Breakfast was superb, plenty of options for all tastes. We enjoyed cocktails in the bar; great for gun lovers! I simply cannot fault this hotel and look forward to visiting again.",5,2016,03,19
120,Fantastic,This really is a beautiful hotel with amazing facilities.  my room was perfect and beyond clean upon arrival. the staff were so helpful and friendly too. Ideally located for exploring London too. Our bed was massive and we slept like babies!,5,2016,03,18
120,BEST Hilton Hotel,"Hilton London Bankside is one of the BEST hotel I've stayed in. The decor is excellent - fresh flowers, modern, clean and nice lobby. Service is top notch! Spacious and modern room with the most comfortable bed with comfy slippers and turn down service. Complimentary mini bar and lovely executive lounge. Nice clean gym with modern machines. This hotel should be a sample for other Hilton hotels or simply clone it for future new ones. The GM at this hotel did an excellent job! London is my fave city and Bankside will be my go to hotel from now on.",5,2016,03,18
120,Outstanding,"Now here is a place that loves to give great service.  Being fairly new, it's all very shiny and impressive. 

The lounge bar is stunning, as was the service in there; prompt, positive and delivered with passion.

My room was lovely and comfortable with everything you need to hand.

I didn't have the opportunity to visit the restaurant,  but it looks beautiful and I am planning my return to do so.

Highly recommended. ",5,2016,03,18
120,Good hotel with some service gkitches,"Stayed here for more than a week.  Hotel is relatively new.  Rooms are larger than some other London Hilton brand hotels (like Westminster Doubletree), have large bathrooms with tub, large screen TV with decent channels and good wi-fi. Southwark tube is about two blocks and a good variety of restaurants is same distance. Couple of small food stores very close and rooms have small fridge, so can stock up on drinks and snacks for a long stay.  Breakfast buffet was good, pastries were very good.  Do not know cost/value as it came with Hilton frequent stay status.  Restaurant service was inconsistent.  Sometimes asked if we wanted coffee/tea, sometimes not.  Sometimes plates cleared, sometimes not.  And did not seem tied to number of wait staff.  Sometimes indifferent service with lots of staff standing around, sometimes good service with few staff running to keep up.  Also, over the course of ten or so days, only once recognized as having been there before.  Seemed odd, because it did not look like the hostesses changed that often.  Usually expect to be recognized over that long a stay.  Not a big deal, but seems to reflect, with other service quirks noted below, something less than a well-organized operation.  Tissue dispenser in room was empty on arrival.  Promptly filled in request.  Stayed in a king room, upgraded (again a frequent guest thing) to complimentary mini-bar.  Which sounds great, but the mini-bar was a couple of cokes, couple of fruit drinks, some peanuts and some gummy bears.  Not exactly a great boon.  Would have been very disappointed to have paid for the perk. And, in another service note, after checking the mini-bar, requested some diet drinks.  Which were provided promptly.  But when the mini-bar was restocked, back to regular drinks.  Not sure why it was not noted somewhere to provide diet.  And then there were the sheets.  Like many European hotels, bed linens included sheets and duvet.  We like two sheets (top and bottom) under the duvet to accommodate the different sleep temps my wife and I like.  So pleased when we arrived to see that linen profile.  After a week, the top sheet went away.  So the next day we requested one again. And it was provided.  Two days later, it went away again.  So we requested again, and it was provided.  Next day gone again.  Again requested, again provided.  On request, the explanation was that Hilton (at a chain policy level) went from two sheets to one during our stay.  Which is fine.  But does not explain why guest request for two sheets could not be followed consistently.  So several very specific service glitches that look like systemic issues, with individual requests promptly accommodated when made, but not a consistent approach to overall guest service.

Bottom line is that we will probably stay here again.  It was a good value (your price may differ) for a good room convenient to tube and reasonable tube ride to most of the central city.  And hopefully the service issues will be ironed out over time.",4,2016,03,17
120,Fabulous!,"This hotel is spacious, clean and modern with huge, comfy beds and proper service. We had an executive room so you get the benefit of food and drinks in the executive lounge which is well worth it. 
The main hotel bar is supposed to be super trendy and drinking there comes at a premium but it lacked atmosphere - it was pretty empty on a Friday night and the service wasn't up to the same standard as the rest of the hotel. Great range of gins on offer though and nice bar nibbles.",5,2016,03,15
120,Fabulous,"Just like all the other Hiltons, this hotel has a great entrance with an amazing reception. The rooms were dazzling with the interior and the facilities they provide. Apart from that the breakfast was okay as I am a vegetarian so there weren't many options available. The swimming pool is heated and relaxing during winters.

I would say that this hotel is perfect for couples and families too. I am definitely choosing this hotel next time I visit London.",5,2016,03,15
120,"Fantastic Hotel, we will be back!","Great modern hotel close to Waterloo Station.  Rooms are in great condition, are quiet and have lovely amenities.  We were upgraded on arrival and were impressed with the standard of service in the hotel.  Breakfast was great and the chefs on duty were very friendly and helpful (some of the best poached eggs I have ever had and I'm very particular on how they're done!). We didn't have a chance to check out the leisure facilities but as we plan on returning here in the next couple of months we will get round to it on our return.",5,2016,03,15
120,Excellent hotel,"Really good stay. Staff were very friendly and helpful. Bar staff were great, we spent a good few hours after the theatre having cocktails made for us by their amazing mixologist! 
Clean, spacious and modern room with THE most comfortable bed!
Complimentary mini bar and lovely executive lounge.",5,2016,03,15
120,Too fussy,"This is a new, plush hotel on the south bank. A short walk from Southwark station - not particularly convenient for the tube but perfectly fine for central London for most.

The décor is excellent, I've been in 5* hotels which are worse.  However, there seem to be about 2 members of staff for every guest so it is a bit imposing unless you are a business traveller.  I know it's a good thing to anticipate   needs but you really don't need a member of staff pressing the lift call button for you!  It gets annoying when your plate is whipped away within two seconds of being empty.

Thankfully the rooms are very comfortable and quiet.  You get slow WiFi for free or you can pay rip-off prices for the real deal - a bit like the Premier Inn across the road!  The hotel spa and swimming pool is also great although watch out for the receptionist (who doesn't speak) and cleaning lady in the mens changing rooms (bonus!).

Breakfast was disappointing.  For starters, I do not need a lecture on how a buffet works.  Food was diced up in delicate containers and presented like a posh French delicatessen.  However, practicality had gone out the window - imagine the faff of picking up the bread out of a badly fashioned bread container with plastic tongs onto a slow and inadequately hot toaster,  The hot food (bacon, etc) was greasy and tasteless.

Would I stay again?  Probably .  Would I book breakfast? No.  What do they need to do to make things better? Give up on the pomp and concentrate on being a practical, friendly hotel.",4,2016,03,14
120,Lovely hotel,"Stopped here for 3 nights. Staff very helpful. Room spotless. Maid must have come in twice a day as not only was the room made up in the morning, the beds were also turned down in the evening. Not sure why she took the complimentary water out of the fridge and put it by the bed though. Would have preferred to get it out cold myself. And in case we hadn't noticed the slippers, they were left by the bed.",5,2016,03,14
120,Best experience so far,"Except for some difficulties checking in I really couldn't name any negative thing. Well, the very high price of breakfast if I have to nitpick.  I've been to a lot of countries in stayed in a lot of different type of hotels, also more expensive hotels, but this one is just right for me: spacious nicely designed room, clean, very nice and attentive staff, etc. From now on this is where I stay if I have to go to the center of London.",5,2016,03,14
120,A Little Dissapointing,"I realise I'm in the minority by only giving this hotel 3 out of 5, there are some aspects that are good but these are my reasons:

On line check in the day before arrival only gave me a choice of 2 rooms, 3rd and 7th floor only, I went for 7th floor, my profile states a high room but was surprised by the lack of choice.

Poorly handled at check in. Being a Silver Hilton Honors member, I expect some recognition, that wasn't the case. Early afternoon check in, the room wasn't ready but was offered a 3rd floor room only, no alternatives and no willingness to try and get us into the room with any expediency. Since we wanted a high floor, we decided to wait. No communication to advise when the room was ready, just have to turn up and see!

Entering the room, the view was a wall, seriously, where does it say that on the website!
Surely some decoration on the wall may help but a plain brick wall is not good.

Beds are hard, whilst I like a firm bed this wasn't comfortable, the mattress topper seemed ineffective.

Breakfast was pretty average, we asked for coffee but it never turned up, I waited whilst the chefs finished a conversation before they took my order for an omelette which was probably the worst cooked omelette I've ever had. Choices of fresh fruit were very limited.

There are some good points, the bar was excellent, good choice of drinks, nice staff, efficient service. Rooms are contemporary, very clean and spacious for London. Bathrooms are good with great showers. The location is good too. 

This was a birthday trip and overall disappointing, I may try it again as I seem to be in the minority with this review but need to think about it.",3,2016,03,14
120,Excellant Saty,We stayed in the Hilton Bankside as we were attending an event in the Shakespeare Globe - the hotel was excellent - we could't fault it The warm welcome on arrival the staff in all departments and the factilities were second to none,5,2016,03,14
120,not your ordinary Hilton...service a little lacklustre here and there,"Stayed for 1 night for a business trip in London. Easy to access from Blackfriars station with a 5 mins walk. Hotel is very impressive in style & appearance not your ordinary Hilton. I stay at their hotels a lot and it was more like a Conrad in service - check in was very friendly and helpful. I stayed in a deluxe twin and had access to the executive lounge which was a lovely area with some great snacks and drinks in the evening in a fresh setting with some cool music. My only criticism was that it was very quiet in the exec lounge and they staff didn't clear plates, different offer re-fills of drinks but at the same time didn't appear to like you going up and getting a re-fill yourself. I had to ask for knives and forks as none were out - so service seemed a little lacklustre here & there when they had little to do. Rooms are very well appointed and comfortable. Overall pleased with my stay and would return at the right price for business or leisure stay.",4,2016,03,14
120,Perfect all-around,"Stayed here two days with my wife.  Paid for suite and access to executive lounge.  Hotel is brand new. Everything spotless and in perfect working order.  Room was comfortable and quiet (6th floor a corner room).  Bed was very comfortable. Excellent amenities.  Free stocked mini bar, excluding alcohol.  Staff very friendly and helpful.  Close to the subway and good sites.  Safe and easy walking. Highly recommend.  ",5,2016,03,13
120,"Great base, clean and fresh","Stayed for one night. Nicely placed close to Southwark tube which allowed us to get around easily. A pretty new hotel, nice welcoming reception and bar area. Friendly and helpful staff with slick room.
Would definitely recommend and use again.",5,2016,03,13
120,Very impressed,Loved it perfect in every way fab rooms the bed is to die for with high quality bed linen coffee and tea in rooms and bed turn down at night with beautiful slippers staff excellent Anthony in reception was so friendly and helpful location was what we wanted decor in hotel very tasteful would highly recommend it can't wait to return again ,5,2016,03,11
120,"Beautiful hotel, and genuine nice staff","The staff at this hotel are honestly the most genuinely kind and welcoming I have experienced anywhere the world over.  From the moment we stepped through the doors with our 18 month old, the staff were sure to greet us and to make friendly conversation, and do whatever they could to make us comfortable. Every time we walked past the front desk, we would have multiple staff greeting us and wishing us a nice day.  Made us feel really welcome.

We had a one bedroom corner suite on the 7th level (top floor) that was very comfortable.  The corner suite was nice because our daughter had jetlag and needed to cry a little bit before falling asleep some nights, and we did not receive any noise complaints.  Non alcoholic drinks and snacks in the mini fridge were complimentary, and we took full advantage :)  As diamond HHonors guests, we also had access complimentary scrumptious breakfasts in the OXBO restaurant each morning, and snacks and drinks at the lounge all day, including afternoon tea service and canapes in the evening time.

The overall atmosphere is more sophisticated but nobody batted an eye at our little girl running around (sometimes in socks or in her swimsuit).  The pool was gorgeous and we had to buy bathing suits at Harrods to partake (we had forgotten to pack ours).  Free waters and plentiful towels at the pool/gym as well.

We thoroughly enjoyed our stay and hope to return to this hotel soon.",5,2016,03,11
120,Nice to be Welcomed,"Such a nice change to be in a hotel where you feel valued and that the staff want to serve you
Nice new rooms, well equipped. Free mini bar helps
Best exec lounge, but why stop serving so early
Really good breakfast too, nice fresh porridge and plenty of options",5,2016,03,11
120,explore  bankside,we were new to this up and coming area and the hotel was a superb introduction and base. Welcomed as a Hilton gold member and upgraded to a suite. the executive lounge was the best we had experienced. A cosy warm comfortable room with a realistic log fire. Attentive staff. A superb location behind Tate modern and near lots of tourist 'must see' sites within easy walking distance or a short taxi ride. We will go back as soon as we can.,5,2016,03,11
120,Perfection from check-in to check-out,"Excellent and friendly staff, top notch executive lounge. Clean, modern and fresh rooms. Nothing at all to complain about at this Hilton property. It's almost as good as Hilton Tokyo and on par with Conrad St James",5,2016,03,10
120,Excellent hotel,"We stayed in a one bedroom suite with exec lounge access.   The suite itself was very comfortable with a view of the shard.   All the furnishings were of high quality and the room was very clean and quiet.   We also liked the free soft drinks and snacks in the room, a nice touch.

Exec lounge is superb, spacious and well furnished.   The service in the lounge was excellent, nothing was too much trouble.   Good selection of food and drinks in the evening.

Hotel also has a nice swimming pool which is unusual in London.

The location of this hotel is great.   About 5 mins walk to tube station and river and 10mins to London Bridge overground station.   We even walked to covent garden in about 20mins.

Breakfast buffet was excellent as was Sunday Brunch.

We would stay here again without doubt.",5,2016,03,10
120,Little gem near London Bridge,"Very pleasantly surprised with the quality of this hotel.  Not only great modern rooms, but fab bar and Hawksmoor restaurant. Very nicely greeted.  Hotel is not so huge so feels more intimate and no queues for anything.  My room didn't have much of a view, but that didn't matter to me.  The best part of my room was a very comfy reading chair with ottoman - so much nice to watch TV from and just relax, rather than in the bed (which was great BTW).  I will definitely be back whenever business brings back to London Bridge area.",5,2016,03,10
120,Best Hotel I have stayed in while visiting London,"This is an Amazing Hotel from the moment you arrive Staff are incredible
so friendly and helpful and this is the norm in all Areas of the hotel.
If possible stay in the Executive rooms as the Executive Lounge is really good , very relaxed atmosphere where you can enjoy a drink and snacks. We stayed in a Junior Suite , beautiful room very comfortable bed. Lots of lovely finishing touches , we always stay in 4 - 5 star hotels when in London which is fairly often , but we wont be booking any other hotel .... after our stay in Hilton Bankside.",4,2016,03,08
120,"Perfect, don't look any further","I'm usually only a consumer of Tripadvisor, this is the first time I've actually written a review, but felt I had to. This hotel is a delight, from the friendly and helpful staff to the perfectly appointed rooms to the restaurant and bar. This will be my first choice for any future visits to London. Thank you to all the wonderful staff for making our trip so enjoyable.",5,2016,03,07
120,Great Hilton property in London with excellent Staff and Amenities,"I had been looking forward to staying at this new Hilton in south London since it opened. It is an amazing property with excellent staff (especially in the executive lounge) that go the extra mile for their guests. After staying in several hotels around the area for work, this is my new preferred choice when in town.",5,2016,03,07
120,Doesn't get any better,"Everything and I mean everything (well almost) was just amazing.

1. Check in was a breeze and done with a smile and light conversation that was very welcoming
2. Rooms were spacious, well decorated in a modern atmosphere
3. Service was impeccable, whether it was the concierge or the front desk or even the Porters
4. Breakfast was well laid out, with enough variety. My only comment here would be that it was a bit repetitive after day 3
5. Location was good. Close enough to many attractions in London, yet far enough from the hustle and bustle

the only negative remark I would have was regarding the room service. I ordered a light snack on my last night. I was told it would take 12-15 minutes. After 20 minutes the food did not arrive so I called back. The food was not ready and I was told that the kitchen is very busy and that it would take an additional 15 minutes. I canceled the order and went to bed hungry.

Other than that, I would not hesitate to stay at the Hilton Bankside again...in fact, I would recommend it to anyone who is looking for a nice comfortable place with great service.",5,2016,03,06
120,Excellent  - and much better value alternative to the Tower Hilton nearby.  Fantastic breakfast.,"I normally stay at the Tower Hilton for work, but decided to give the new Bankside a go - it is only a 25 min walk away.  I'm a Hilton Diamond, so not sure whether everyone would get what I got.  Overall a good impression - nice and new and the staff are friendly and go out of their way to make you feel welcome.  Public areas are nice, and the exec lounge is much bigger and nicer than the Tower.  Great pool, and gym facilities, pool is long and warm - changing rooms are lovely - although no sauna/steam room  The bedroom I had was nicer than the Tower - new with big fluffy duvet and a good night's sleep - I was very pleased to find the minibar (soft drinks, nuts and sweets only) was free of charge (I think this might be for upgrades/diamond members -but not sure).  Breakfast in the restaurant was excellent, probably the best I've had in years of staying at Hiltons in London, and hotels worldwide - and sets it apart from other hotels. I particularly liked the prawn cocktail (had 2 they were so good) and the pickled herring (didn't have one but nice to have the choice), also the almond croissant things with icing sugar on.  They also had a good range of gluten free things.  The orange juice was more like the freshly squeezed stuff, not the glutinous 'mix' that you normally get.   I saw another person having eggs benedict, which I might have had if I had not been already sated by the other stuff.  Like all of the staff, the Chef at breakfast was lovely, cooking things to order and being friendly.  
If I had to have a small moan, they finish the exec lounge canapés/drinks early - most Hiltons do 8.30 or 9pm - I arrived at 7.50pm and it was finished, food cleared away and drinks gone - they advertise 8pm, they should really stick to this.  I also think the breakfast (at £25) and the food on the room service menu is a bit overpriced - but there are plenty of other options nearby, so they are not holding a captive market - Tesco and Sainsbury open til 11pm are a 2 minute walk for those who just want a snack.    Very good in summary, and will stay again.",5,2016,03,06
120,We will definitely be coming back!,"We were really impressed with this Hilton, having stayed in a few other Hiltons this comes out at the top. 
We were greeted as soon as we walked through the doors and had our bags taken up to our room. Check in was quick and efficient with the lady at the desk offering several options for things to do in London. 

We had a standard room and it was excellent, it was spacious, clean and really nicely designed. 
The bed was incredibly comfy - which is what you need after a long day walking around London!

The bar at the hotel 'The Distillery' was perfect for an evening drink, it had a great atmosphere combined with knowledgable bar staff recommending drinks. 

We stayed here for two nights and it was thoroughly enjoyable and will be staying again! ",5,2016,03,06
120,Modern design place,"I spent one night in this hotel and a day at the hotel conference center. I was surprised by the modern sleek design, my room was all wood and tiles. It had a shower, ironing board, robe and an umbrella. It also had a charging station that worked with my continental Europe plugs for computer and telephone charger. The breakfast room is very nice if you do not mind a huge dead buffalo stuffed head hanging above your table. The choice of meals for breakfast was perfect. The staff was very friendly. In the conference room at the basement you could here the tube I assume, as from time to time there was this sound which resembled a train going behind the wall. There is small Selfridges within 100 m from the hotel as well as some nice coffee shops. Tate Modern is  5 minutes walk from there. If you travel by tube take the Jubilee line to Southwark, then it is about 10 minutes walk through the neighbourhood, you cannot see the hotel from the tube station. But it was not unconvenient if you travel light for business. With its clean, new and sleek design, I will definately put this place in my memory for next trip, even with family.",5,2016,03,05
120,My new favourite Hilton in London,"I have stayed in a number of Hiltons and Double Tree Hiltons in London and around the UK on business and for breaks with the family and I have to say this is one of the best.

It is in a decent location for visiting he attractions of the South Bank and is situated on a side street with bars, restaurants and a couple of super markets close by.

It is a fairly new hotel with an impressive lobby, spacious well equipped rooms and excellent bathroom.

What makes it stand out is the friendly and helpful nature of the staff. Eveywhere from the concierege, check in staff and at breakfast were superb and an example to the Hilton Group of the standards that can be achieved.

I even had someone check that the mini bar containing soft drinks and snacks in my deluxe room was full and while i was out in the evening there was a turn down service, the bathroom was cleaned and slippers placed by the bed - nice touches on a one night stay.

Breakfast was also very good with a wide selection of hot items, breads and pastries and even smoked salmon and a cheese board!

I will definitely be back if im in that part of town again.",5,2016,03,04
120,Relaxing,"Chose this hotel as the rooms have twin (double) beds which adds to a great nights sleep.

Location is great as it's easy to find parking at the weekend and close to central London and within walking distance of lots of touristy sights.

The staff were super friendly and helpful and aim to please ever customer.

The rooms are spacious modern and the beds extremely comfortable.

",5,2016,03,03
120,If you could have a 6 star hotel - it would be this one ,"I know the title is a bold claim and of course outside of the U.K. you can have a 6 star. 
This Hilton is one of the nicest hotels I've stayed, anywhere around the world (beach front villas excluded ). It's new so everything is sparkling, the attention to detail is apparent everywhere and the rooms are beautifully spacious. 
The ""thing"" that makes this place so special are the staff. I don't know who does the training here but I'd like to employ them. Nothing is too much trouble, everybody has a genuine smile and you are left feeling wanted. 
The bar would be a great bar even if it wasn't part of the hotel - if you like gin then  I imagine it's heaven. 
The restaurant is very good, the food feels like it's cooked with pride - more so than many of the surrounding restaurants actually. However, the real ""piece de resistance "" is if you are lucky enough to upgrade to the Exec rooms. Obviously the rooms are a bit nicer, amazing actually, but it's the Exec lounge that just wins. 
Big enough to host meetings (I do that regularly ) without irritating those who are there to relax. Complimentary drinks and snacks, amazing service and genuinely a real pleasure to hang around in. 

I told you I liked it. ",5,2016,03,03
120,An excellent stay,"I stayed in a delux king room last week for a meeting. Excellent room, very spacious with complimentary soft drinks and snacks- lovely touch! Bathroom spotless and room very well presented. Executive Lounge was lovely for breakfast, however the one downside is my room service was disappointing with the wagu beef burger which was quite tough and cold! Excellent room however and excellent hotel!",5,2016,03,02
120,Great for a pitstop after a show,"Stayed here for one night as we needed somewhere to stay after a show.  Prior to check in our room was upgraded (Hilton Diamond) to a very comfortable King Deluxe room.  Check in was smooth and we were in our room in minutes, room was clean and well thought out - with multiple complimentary bottles of water and a welcome snack.

The Executive Lounge is very good, and one of the newest I have experienced at my stays at various Hiltons.  The food in the lounge was very nice, and the drinks selected was also above my expectations (spirits were also available).

The bed was comfy as always, and our sleep was uninterrupted with no noise from the road outside.  Breakfast in the lounge was an orderly affair, with various selections of breads, pastries, meats, cheeses, fruits and more.  

Staff overall, very attentive and polite.

We enjoyed our stay and would recommend.",5,2016,03,01
120,Great Hotel,"Lots of positives about this hotel, only one negative. Firstly the good, I booked via booking.com and paid a comparatively very good price for our two night weekend stay.
The location is great for ease of access from Waterloo station, just a 10 minute walk.
Check in very easy, the staff are very friendly and helpful. The room itself was very spacious, especially for London hotels, modern and equipped with all you'd expect in a standard hotel.
The hotel is recetly refurbished and this must have included sound proofing, it was one of the quietest nights Ive spent in a hotel.
The only negative was on returning from a night out at five minutes before midnight we went to the bar for a night cap and was asked if we minded ordering a drink asap as last orders were about to be called. We were handed a drinks menu to which I replied its okay we know what we want Ill have a JD and coke and my partner will have a quantro and lemonade. The bar bill was £27 for just two drinks. I expect to pay London prices but I see this as daylight robbery.
In summary I would return to this hotel without hesitation, but will be avoiding the bar.",4,2016,03,01
120,Magnificent,"My previous experiences of London hotels has not been flattering.
London Bankside was a positive suprise in every aspect. Super friendly and nice staff, clean and modern facitilites and a ""to die for"" breakfast! Nothing to complain about. Thank you for making our stay pleasant!",5,2016,02,29
120,Excellent modern hotel ,"Really modern, well designed and clean hotel in a great location less than 5 minutes to Southwark station, supermarkets next door and 10 minutes to the shard where we went for breakfast one day. Staff also very efficient and friendly. Think we've found our new go to hotel when we stay in London as we couldn't have faulted it. ",5,2016,02,28
120,"Fantastic hotel, ","We stayed here for one night, we were out and about most of the time so didn't use the facilities but all in all I was really happy with this hotel.  Very stylish, well fit out, incredible beds and the rooms were perfect.  Only tiny niggle was the water temperature fluctuated a bit, but in saying that I would absolutely stay here again.  Also, staff were very kind and helpful. 

",5,2016,02,28
120,Good modern hotel in central location,I stayed here for a night on a business trip. The hotel is very clean and the staff were all very helpful. I stayed on the 3rd floor and the room was really quiet. The room had a nice decor and I particularly liked the walk in shower. The hotel met all my needs and is in a great location for exploring central London.,5,2016,02,27
120,Short visit to London,"Very good new hotel, not busy streets around and walkable distance to all tourist attractions. Walking distance to Blackfriars railroad station. Food is exceptional but pricy. As everything else in London.",5,2016,02,27
120,Nice new Hotel,"We stayed two nights at this new Hilton hotel, nice lobby with good welcome service.
The room was nice a shame we had a a view to a wall. The housekeeping is as usual in London not really good at 3 pm the room was still not done, but after I complained it was finally for 5 pm equipped with new towels and ready to get dressed for the Royal Albert Hall.
The best part of the Hotel is the fitness with the pool really great.",4,2016,02,27
120,Best Hotel in London!,"I spent two nights here and did not want to leave. This hotel supposedly represents Hilton's ""new style approach"" and it is a great showpiece for it. It's all retro-industrial chic with dim lighting everywhere. Sinde the hotel is only a few months old, everything is immaculate. Even the lobby bathroom is like a spa, with rolled cotton washcloths in place of paper towels.

Staff were wonderful and service is top-notch. The Distillery Bar is chic with sylish furniture and great service. And the Oxbo restaurant has the most sensational breakfast I have seen at any hotel, a bachannalian buffet of every kind of hot and cold item and beverage you can image.

The room was great, with a super-comfortable bed, linens, and pillows and huge wall-mounted TV screen with lots of channels. There was plenty of space especially in the bathroom which was big and had with an amazing shower. 

My only gripes are (1) you cannot use a hairdryer in the bathroom because of the outlet capacity, so you have to dry your hair in the main room without a mirror, and (2) the lighting is so dim in the bathroom I didn't feel I could check my image accurately or put on my makeup precisely, even with the lights as bright as they would go.",5,2016,02,25
120,"New hotel, highly recommended","Good central location, excellent service. The hotel was new in November 2015 and everything was squeaky clean. The rooms are well equipped for business needs. I really enjoyed the bar area, and breakfast was very comprehensive and high quality. Not a cheap stay, but competitively priced. I enjoyed it. ",5,2016,02,24
120,Excellent. ,"A great hotel. Stayed here a few times with work, and would certainly stay again. 

The rooms are great, bathrooms modern. 

The staff in the bar are spot on. 

I would highly recommend a stay here. If y I do, make sure you visit the bar for some of there Gin",5,2016,02,23
120,Outstanding Hotel & First Class Service,"My wife and I have just comeback from a mini break in London and stayed at this hotel. The service was fantastic, the staff were friendly and attentive. It is the first time we have stayed in a hotel where the pictures on the website our an actual representation of real life. Stayed on the 7th floor in a one bedroom suite. Room was spacious, clean and immaculate. This room was recommended by the reception manager Pier (sorry if wrong spelling). Location is very good... Only 3 minutes behind the Tate modern. Highly recommend.... Will go back again. Thank you guys for making our mini moon very special. ",5,2016,02,22
120,"Great Hotel, Staff and Location, Amazing breakfast","stayed for 3 nights and could not fault anything, you can walk to most places, fab breakfast, great rooms and staff, I cannot recommend this hotel highly enough, we got a great price too. 2 minutes from the Thames and Tate Modern and 5 minutes from Southwark Tube",5,2016,02,22
120,Hilton Bankside - highly recommended,"Possibly the best hotel we've stayed at for some time. The facilities are excellent and nothing is too much trouble for the superb staff team. Walking distance from transport links, such as Southwark and Waterloo, and London attractions, St.Pauls, Tower Bridge, Tate Modern & Borough Market..... the list continues. Everyone was very polite, friendly and helpful. Fabulous breakfast and dinner menu, and the Distillery lounge bar which has a great ambiance. Definitely will return.",5,2016,02,22
120,Excellent hotel,The hotel is very well located and easy to get too. It has very friendly staff and we were upgraded to a large suite with additional 20 pounds. The room was big and clean which was perfect for a family. The best feature of this hotel is its executive lounge with its quality food and drinks with very helpful and friendly staff.,5,2016,02,22
120,Best Hilton in London,"The Hilton Bankside is the perfect hotel for a leisure visit to London. Built within the revitalised area of Bankside it is quieter than many central London hotels and yet is only 5-10 minutes walk from either Southwark underground or London Blackfriars making it easy to get out and visit many London sights.
The hotel is appointed to a high standard with luxury fittings, Bose speakers in the room and a luxury feel to the Hotel from the lobby and restaurant through to the rooms and executive lounge.
The restaurant is superb and the food is excellent as is the variety for breakfast.
I will definitely stay here again and is now my favourite hotel in London",5,2016,02,21
120,Not a very impressive welcome ,"The hotel is really nice , modern and new. I must admit that customer service in the bar and restaurant was second to none and breakfast was absolutely delicious. My partner liked the Gym and was very impressed with the swimming pool.

So where did they go wrong ? 

We arrived to the hotel with pre-paid  booking from hotels.com. For some reason our reservation was not in the system ...We all know it does happen that the booking can be missed by reservation, might not drop in to the system automatically etc. It was not a problem as we had booked the room, had the email confirmation, hotel was not full and every if Hilton is big enough to allocate us in a sister hotel. 

I suggested we will wait in the bar till they have a look and find out what went wrong. So we ordered ourselves drinks to start enjoying our night out in London (glass of wine and vodka lime and soda 22 quid) . I assumed we will be called to check in shortly. 

I was soo wrong... We waited in the bar untill a lady arrived  only  to explain to us that hotel doesn't have our booking. We were informed it was not a problem as the booking can be made make at any time but for double of the price we had already paid and 50% more than the website price. 

My partner called hotels.com and I believed that they contacted the hotel . Problem was solved and we were able to check in. 

As an apology from the hotel we were informed we can use complimentary mini bar (complimentary water, juice and nuts are provided as a standard in every bedroom) and we will be given the nicest room in the category we booked ( I am assuming that in a new built modern hotel all rooms in the category would be the same )

The problem with the missing booking aside, the hotel facilities were excellent.

",2,2016,02,21
120,Wonderful hotel,"Everything from check-in to check-out was easy and went smoothly at this hotel. Very efficient and friendly staff, super comfortable bed and linens, modern decoration in rooms, beautiful bathrooms with good quality toiletries. The location was great with easy access to the underground and plenty of restaurants within close walking distance. I will definitely stay at this hotel again.",5,2016,02,21
120,Amazing Hotel,"The hotel is beautiful. The staff is friendly and courteous. The breakfast buffet is exceptional, but I don't know whether it is affordable because it was included free of charge for me. My only criticism is that my room was too hot and then too cold, but the staff was very responsive and immediately sent maintenance to address the problem twice. The Distillery is a wonderfully chic bar in the hotel. The bartender, Ricardo, went out of his way to make delicious drinks catered to my tastes and was very gracious and personable. I would highly recommend this hotel to anyone and would definitely return in the future.",5,2016,02,21
120,Fab new hotel!,"Stayed overnight in town for a dinner.

Had seen this Hilton being built but hadn't realised it had quietly opened.

Really impressed.

Big rooms, modern luxurious furnishings.

Very good breakfast.

Hope to stay again.",5,2016,02,21
120,Excellent ,"As a diamond member since 2002 I have stayed in a few hiltons and have to say my experience with this Hilton with regards to service has been the best I have encountered. Every member of staff I walked past, interacted with or was served by was exceptional. The training or recruitment from the Bankside team is really paying off. My Hilton in London for future visits.

Recommend a high floor with executive lounge access we could see the top of Big Ben and the London eye.

How could the hotel improve? A mirror for the ladies in the bedroom rather than the bathroom or behind the wardrobe door.

I noticed the bar was a little quiet and would suggest the drinks may be over priced £26 for two single rum and cokes even for London was expensive. Tesco and sainsburys 10 yards from the hotel and many appeared to buy drinks for your room. ",5,2016,02,21
120,A new London favourite,"On a recent trip to London for a fairly regular business committment I decided noted the recently (ok, last August) opened Hilton Bankside had a suitable selection of rooms. I was fortunate enough to be in a Twin Executive Room with access to the lounge, having been able to get a good price through the Hilton HHonours App. 

From check in to check out the staff were faultless, courteous and immensely efficient. We did have a king room initially assigned to us, but this mistake was corrected quickly and without quibble and a suitable room with twin beds was found in the time it took us to walk back to the lobby. Both rooms were furnished to an exceptional standard, the beds (at least in our actual room) were very comfortable, and the room was perfectly clean. 

I did note that other reviews have commented on a lack of hairdryer plug in the bathroom and lack of mirror near any plugs, and my female roommate discovered the same frustrations when wanting to do her hair, which is a shame as I imagine a bit of mirror rearrangment would be trivial to accomplish. It would be nice to have an input into the tv/music system too, especially with the nifty feature of having the sound passed through into the bathroom.  

We had both evening drinks/canapes and breakfast in the Executive Lounge and both were of very high quality. Both the accommodation and the refreshments of the lounge were well above the usual standard, and the entire stay was made very much more pleasant by our access. 

The swimming pool in the basement was a welcome surprise (and the reason I'd picked the hotel) as it was a 1.2m deep 20m swimming pool more than adequate to swim some laps in rather than the usual relaxing hotel pools. to find this in London was a major selling point. 

Check out could not have been easier, particularly as a HHonours Silver member so credit cards etc were all on file and we were checked out faster than they could retrieve the bags we'd asked them to mind while we ate breakfast. All very efficient and impressive, with a great focus on customer service and the ""make it right"" policy enacted swiftly in the one small way it was needed. This hotel is likely to become my new go-to place to stay when doing business in London.",5,2016,02,20
120,"Fantastic service & consistent, truly excellent",The staff are excellent throughout the Hotel and are very professional./ I cannot speak highly enough. The room/suite was very spacious/quiet and comfortable. The exec lounge is excellent and the service is very personable & efficient. I have a Hilton Honors Diamond loyalty card & I view this Hotel to be the best for service in a Hilton in London! Breakfast was excellent too & I will now stay here for business & pleasure,5,2016,02,20
120,Amazing,"Have just returned from a three night stay and I was very impressed by: the courteous, efficient staff; the well stocked and atmospheric bar; the lavish choices at breakfast; the twin room with two queen sized beds; the fab rain shower; its position on the South Bank and the good price I got it all for.
Will I return?? Absolutely 😀",5,2016,02,20
120,Amazing hotel close to public transportation,Really enjoyed my stay here for three days. Quick check in. Was glad when my room was ready at 8 am after getting off international flight. Bar is nice and has good drinks. Riccardo went out of his way to make sure we were well taken care of. Room was spacious and well appointed. Would definitely stay again.,5,2016,02,20
120,Gorgeous hotel,"The Hilton London Bankside hotel is in a great location with plenty of amenities on it's doorstep, the Tate gallery being one. The rooms are beautifully decorated and restful. The pool was an added bonus and a perfect temperature for a relaxing swim. The staff were very pleasant and the hotel bar most luxurious. I will be returning!",5,2016,02,20
120,Exceeded expectations,"This newly opened Hilton definitely exceeded all my expectations. The building itself was top quality and really clean. It was located centrally being close to Southwark tube and several bus stops.

We arrived early and were greeted by Anthony at one of the reception desks, he was polite and thorough making conversation. He stored are bags and had them sent to the room for are eventual arrival. When we got into the room the bathroom was one of the best I've seen in a hotel with a huge shower. We headed back out and when we returned the bed had been turned down with fresh towels and slippers left at the bed, this was a very nice touch and more than was expected for a one night stay. We've stayed in a number of hotels in London but this is definitely one that we would visit again and recommend to friends. What makes this hotel even better was the price.",5,2016,02,19
120,"Great,Friendly Hotel","Its a quieter place to stay in London but near a tube station. We stayed here when we were in the audience of The Graham Norton Show.only 5 minutes walk to the studios.The Hotel is very clean, room is a good size, free sweets and soft drinks in the fridge. The staff were very friendly. we had the self-service breakfast which is cereal and full English, They also have a healthy option plus gluten free options

A little tip. If you can wait until the last minute to book then it could be cheaper.  When we first checked the price about 6 month before going the hotel was too expensive but we checked again 1 month before and the price was £300 cheaper, a big saving. If you want to save more money then book through a cashback-site.",5,2016,02,19
120,Very clean but price you bar spoils it,"Went to London for a couple of days with my wife and booked the hotel without any prior knowledge. The reception and book in where excellent, couldn't be more helpful, I lost count of how many people asked to carry our bags. The hotel is quite new and the whole place was neat and tidy, stylish decor. The room albeit not huge (we went for basic double) was more than adequate, plenty of storage, robe, slippers etc, the bed was extremely comfortable with high quality duvet and pillows , too hot for me but ideal for my wife. Fantastic bathroom and everything clean and well presented, the rooms climate control effective.
Can't comment on the restaurants as we ate out, the hotel is in walking distance of everything. 
We did use the pool, which is 17m, a good length to swim and a good temperature, all again well presented and clean.
Our whole stay was really good, the only blot on the copy book being the extortionate prices for drinks at the bar even for London, we all expect to pay more than the norm, but £8 or £9 for a pint of beer is disgusting, we walked away. I would advise folk to bring their own wine for the room (they provide opener and wine glasses) . The sad thing was, that had it been £6 a pint I probably would have had a couple rather than non.",4,2016,02,18
120,Quality hotel in a good location,"Quality hotel at a reasonable price just a few minutes walk to the River Thames and Tate Modern. Clean, nicely decorated rooms and very friendly and efficient staff. Nothing to fault, though would recommend a high floor room for a better view.",5,2016,02,18
120,Valentine Retreat,"Stayed here for 1 night on Valentine's day. As soon as we arrived in the hotel the staff were so friendly and couldn't do enough to help us. As we were only young I thought we could be put in a poorer hotel room but we were put in the top floor over looking the shard and other sights in London. The hotel room was so clean and big. The bathroom was lovely. We had a lady come in as soon as we got there asking if we needed any more drinks for our mini bar. Then had a call in the morning to see if we needed any help with our luggage. The staff couldn't of done enough for us! We decided to have a drink in there bar that night, which was the valentine's special and it really was special!! Our photo was taken and printed which was then given to us in a little envelope with a rose, on a slate with the drinks. In the morning before we checked out we managed to use the pool and gym which was lovely. We were the only ones using it. The pool was lovely to just have a quite swim and was very clean.  Would recommend this hotel to anyone wanting to book! Shame I can't remember the lovely man who checked us in though!! Would of liked the hotel to of known who he was as he was so friendly and helpful! and the lovely lady who worked in the bar!! Thank you so much for a wonderful valentines stay!!",5,2016,02,18
120,Great new addition to the Hilton family,"The hotel only opened back in October 2015 so I understand. It's in a great location, really easy to find and a short walk from Southwark tube station.
The hotel is modern and well designed. The room décor is really good, very clean throughout and the room fridge with complimentary soft drinks and nibbles a nice gesture but very welcome.
Dining options in the hotel are brilliant. The OXBO restaurant has a great selection. I opted for the snails to start and Wagyu Steak Burger...very nice and a good portion size also. The hotel bar is called ""The Distillery"", a great relaxing area and plenty of choices on offer. 
From entering the hotel each member of staff I spoke were very pleasant and welcoming, great to see and it does make such a difference. 
I'll certainly be staying here again when next in London - Well done, excellent stay.",5,2016,02,18
120,Just returned after 3 great nights,"Great quiet location but easy to get to most places. New hotel, great rooms and amazing breakfast and staff, if in London you must stay here. I am a Hilton member and can highly recommend this hotel. You can get great deals to. I will return.",5,2016,02,17
120,Love love love,"Am staying here as I write. Came from the Park Lane Hilton but in my opinion this is much better. Modern funky decor and brand new rooms. As a HHonors diamond member I was upgraded to an executive room which had a lovely little lounge area. A massive unexpected bonus was that the non alcoholic content of the minibar was free - ideal when you have a thirsty child. The check in was very pleasant (thank you to Per who was very welcoming). The highlight of our trip has been the executive lounge. The service is exemplary and the staff are a credit to Hilton. It strikes just the right balance between opulence and comfort. We had canapes one evening from 6pm which were delicious, and the breakfast was very nice and relaxed, with staff happy to accommodate any special requests. Another real plus was the beautiful swimming pool. Spotlessly clean and very chilled atmosphere. Though it was half term my daughter and I had it to ourselves. The gym is also well equipped and open 24h. Though this hotel is a bit of a walk from the tube, Ubers are very cheap into town. It's close to the eye and the South Bank. I have stayed in Hiltons all over the world and I honestly cannot think of one thing this hotel could do better.

PS we loved the valentine chocolates and the turndown with my daughter's teddy tucked in :-)",5,2016,02,17
120,Amazing,"Guest room was decent and felt it was worth the money! I will be back to upgrade suites! perfect location not far from the city, I would definitely recommend this hotel! I have been to a few Hiltons in my time but this hotel will certainty be paid another visit and I will be upgrading my room to a junior suite!  Gym was okay. Pool looked amazing but didn't get the opportunity to take a dip.",5,2016,02,16
120,Great stay at the Hilton again...,"A bit of a fan but this hotel is both modern and well managed.
The usual great service plus the well trained and enthusiastic (smiling) staff; from the front desk to breakfast team....
Well done. Have to come again.
I have to fill up the 200 characters requirements but really everything was great: bed, decor, floor...
I couldn't find a spot of dust in the room.",5,2016,02,16
120,Lovely bar with Ricky! ,"Best cocktails in London, brilliant service, brilliant rooms and more importantly brilliant drinks from Ricky!! You will not find a friendlier staff than this hotel, travelled from Glasgow and it is a home from home. If you want a cocktail just tell them what you want any and it will appear!!",5,2016,02,15
120,"Fresh, new and modern ","Attentive reception staff, take their time to ensure you feel very welcome.

We arrived early, were able to leave our luggage which was delivered to our room - nice touch!

Lovely Bar, staff very friendly - not many places now that allow staff to 'chat' to guests.

Perfect location with easy access to the South Bank.

Highly recommend ",5,2016,02,15
120,Good location,"Reception staff were very charming and efficient....   Room absolutely fine and as expected tho' when I queried the lack of ""complimentary soft drinks and snacks"" per the notification in the room, nothing materialised!?  (We were there for 2 nights).  
Shame about the 'garden' we walked by/viewed from the windows of the corridor to our room...weeds and more weeds - not pretty! (we were on the 4th floor).  Really could/should have made something of that area.
Location was good - just behind Tate modern, so short walk and right into the city/St Pauls (worth a visit at 5pm for Evensong and no entrance fee)..   The excellent Borough market just a 10 min walk.
We chose to eat breakfast very near by (Albion - tho' there are many other options) given the £20+ cost via the hotel seemed more than a little steep.",4,2016,02,15
120,Great Hotel for little money,"I was truly impressed by a seamless experience at the Hilton. Very friendly staff, great lounge, nice rooms, good gym, very good location and everything at a very fair price (for London). Probably one of the best hotel stays I had in a big city such as London.",5,2016,02,15
120,Lovely stay!,"I stayed at this hotel on Saturday 13th Feb for one night. Was a really reasonable price for London hotels and we had a superior room breakfast included. When we checked in the lady on the desk Hannah was very helpful and friendly. Overall the staff at this hotel couldn't do enough for you, when any staff member see you they would say good morning or afternoon which people in the UK aren't normally that friendly! The room was perfect, clean, modern, lovely shower & comfortable bed! We also had a slice of chocolate cake delivered to the room after we arrived which was a nice touch. We went out for dinner nearby and then came back and had some drinks in the bar. The man who served our table in the bar was soo helpful, he recommended cocktails/beers when we wasn't sure which ones to have (he didn't pick the most expensive either like a lot of staff members would of) Also when they didn't have the cocktail my partner liked he asked the bar to make this and they did. Also when we returned to the room someone had been into the room and pulled the bed covers back put slippers next to the bed and a bottle of water on the bedside table which is a nice touch. Breakfast was lovely, so much to choose from! Overall was  a lovely stay and would stay here again.",5,2016,02,15
120,I still don't know how much I paid!,"The hotel it's self if beautiful. The rooms are glorious and the location is great. 
I would however avoid eating here as £18 for a sandwich and £28 for two cocktails is a bit steep and there's places just as great near by. 
The one BIG problem I had here was how much it cost. I still have no idea how much I paid. 
The room was £149 but they took a £100 deposit before I got there. Followed by £49.50 on arrival and another £50 deposit so so far it's cost £199.50 we then had to pay £28 for the TWO cocktails we had (which weren't that great) and somehow they bill when we left was £77 with the £50 deposit returned. This does not make sense at all. Surely my final bill should have only been £28?
This place is probably for those who see their extra £50 deposit as pocket change and not those looking for a special weekend. 
I probably wouldn't stay here again as I think there's other places better suited to my travelling style. ",4,2016,02,14
120,beware on line check in!,"On line looks like a good idea! Check in on your phone , email receipt when you check out - easy!  BUT if they happen to allocate you to the wrong room :you're a no show!
You might use the bar, the gym, even breakfast - but not according to Hilton!
Never mind the obvious security implications but good luck reclaiming on expenses.
Phoned the hotel but didn't reply - guess I'm still an alias!
Hotel does have a great location and rooms are modern , just make sure you check in the old fashioned way!",2,2016,02,14
120,My initial impression day 2,"The customer interaction and passion to satisfy guests were exceptional except with front desk staff I arrived on Friday night at around 1045 when the construction just happened to rope off the street directly in front of the hotel so my taxi was unable to drive me to the front door.  The lady at the concierge desk just stood at the counter and looked at me struggling with my oversized luggage. She never summoned anyone to assist me.  In fact she directed me to her male colleague when I managed to push my luggage forward.  Clerk was quite helpful but he was not very accommodating when I asked to check other options.   Since it had been a long day, I accepted the room.  Pedro took my bags to the room and was very helpful. 

I am staying for few more nights  I am having my Sunday breakfast now in the main dining room and wanted to capture my thoughts from last 2 days.  The Executive lounge staff Angela and Philip were A+.  The housekeeping service had been competent.  The room has been clean and well prepared, but staff not as friendly.  The dining room staff were on top of everything, moving folks along and keeping tables cleared.   The kitchen has been extremely efficient and accurate with the egg orders.  Yesterday, the concierge desk was more helpful and he made sure I got proper help but unfortunately the queue was long thus experienced a long wait.  

The facilities feel awkward but I am getting used to it now. Feng shui is off even in the rooms.  Lobby is beautiful but feels cold and sterile.  The Exec lounge is modern but seem too over furnished. The king deluxe room is comfortably sized but have limited windows so quite dark.  I would have asked to move to another room but did not want the trouble of dealing with front desk again. Finally, the dining room is modern chic with special design touches (white cats) fresh flowers, mixed media.  

I will share my final thoughts about overall experience after I check out this week.  Meanwhile, this is a new Hilton hotel and I can see the Hilton team working very hard to improve the process and the execution.  

To help my fellow travelers, I would say that this hotel is worth trying because the Hilton team is fixing and learning and striving to be top of class staying with Hilton brand. ",4,2016,02,14
120,Such a shame........,"I seldom write reviews. It's usually only when something irks me. Read on.

This is a really good hotel. It opened in Q4 2015. I've stayed a half dozen times so feel reasonably well qualified to comment.

The staff are lovely and efficient with it. Whether you are checking in/out, in the executive lounge, in the bar or in the restaurant you will be impressed with the staff.

The rooms are very well appointed with high specifications. All rooms i've stayed in have been quiet. There are no nice views from any of the rooms and the area works best as a business location (just over Blackfriars or Southwark bridges you're in the City or a 10 minute walk you are in the area of the Shard) rather than a tourist base i would say. However it's always been business stays for me and i'm fine with c40 minute walk to the west end; or a 15 minute walk to the South Bank.

The thing that lets this place down though imho is the security. Firstly I have never seen a hotel so populated by CCTV. Wherever you are in the hotel you are being actively observed ( for fun i have engaged in the occasional bit of non-standard behaviour and seen how quickly things get escalated ). Secondly, the unsmiling, smartly dressed muscle dotted and roaming around the public areas gives the place a sense of low level menace (and please note the hotel is not located in an area where walk-in trouble can be anticipated......you the guests are seen as the potential trouble!). The public areas are pretty small so that their presence is obvious and because they have so little to do, again one is being constantly observed. I have also experienced how the concierge team can also be a little over zealous in security. I could write a thesis on how asset protection detracts from customer satisfaction and customer experience! 

This is all a shame as ( i repeat ) this is a really good hotel.",4,2016,02,12
120,Ticks all the boxes at this price,"Location is spot on. 
The breakfast is one of the best in London. 
Rooms are excellent
Even a cool bar off the bar
The staff are highly attentive. 
I will certainly book this hotel again for biz and pleasure. 
Regardless which station you come it's a bit of a walk. Recommend jubilee 
In the evening you have so much choice in any direction. ",4,2016,02,11
120,sightseeing and relaxing holidays,"new hotel .. wide room( 35 to 45 ft )  .. perfect location (5 min walk to southwark station .. 3 stop from leicester square  ) 10 min walk to london bridge and Camden Market .. nice bar and coffeshop around it (tesco, sainsbury and cost coffee in front of the hotel).",5,2016,02,11
120,My new favourite hotel in London - awesome place,"I have been working and staying in London for years now, so I know a good hotel when I find one - This new Hilton is excellent!
From the initial greeting from the Front desk staff, to the quality of the rooms, to the food in the restaurant at Breakfast - it is all great!
The hotel has an Exec Lounge, but not the 'usual' London Hotel offering; e.g. a small room with a couple of bottles of Becks in a Fridge.  The Bankside has a nice spacious Lounge with good mixture of beverage/snacks and Staff providing lovely service.
It has a decent 24hr Gym and unusually for such a central hotel, it also has a Pool.
Location is good, a 5 minute walk from Southwalk Tube station (Jubilee line), or a short walk to London Bridge.
I'm at a loss to find a bad point about this hotel...probably that it is so good, it's busy and it can be difficult to get a booking some weeks :o(",5,2016,02,10
120,This Hilton has broken the mould,"Let me start of by saying I haven't stayed in a Hilton for years, because I've found them too uniformed and no personality.

I stayed at this hotel on 16th January 2016, it was a weekend away with my husband. I wanted a change of scenery as I normally stay in a Crowne plaza hotels.

This Hilton has stepped up their game, What a awesome hotel.

We decided to drive to London from Hampshire and made use of their valet parking, we booked this in advance, it was £40 for 24hr - which I thought was typical of London parking prices.
When we arrived I was really surprised with the reception area it's has a really urban funk to it - it has a nice open space but not to big where you feel lost.

Hilton have put some real thought into how the receptionist interacts with 'the customer', I loved the individual reception desk (there is 4 inc concierge) this allows the receptionist to come around from the desk and really interact with the customer.
We were checked in my a tall blonde guy, I think from memory his name was Per (please forgive me if i've got that completely wrong) - he was fab, great banter but he kept his professionalism! 

Bedroom - our room was on the 4th floor. Our room was by the lifts which admittedly I was unhappy due to the fact every other hotel I've stayed in near the lifts you'll always hear loads of noise in the mornings by housekeeping.....but this is the first hotel I didn't hear a single thing in the morning....bliss!!
The room decor was minimal chic but all necessities were covered, I liked the funky reading lights. It was a clutter free room.
Now ""The Bed"".....oh my god, it was amazingly comfortable. Great night sleep = happy customer!

Dinner - can't comment we went out

Breakfast - We were welcomed my a lady who was cheerful and informative. Excellent buffet selection, there were 3 chefs behind the hotplate area taking customer specified orders and I must say they worked excellent as a team with a high number of orders, at breakfast everyone wants their orders 'now' and by the time I grabbed a few more cold items my order was done.
The decor was awesome, they've nailed industrial warehouse chic!

Upon check-out, the receptionist (young guy with dark hair) asked us a great question ""As we have recently opened is they any improvements we can make""....it goes to show that they want genuine feedback (some hotels can't even take constructive critique). All new hotels will have teething issues but if a customer doesn't tell the hotel while they are there - the hotel won't have the chance to put things right or improve.

BTW - I loved the fact the hotel has hints of foxes around the hotel, I suppose it reflects the 'urban' side....
Also we walked to Borough Market, which is a must if you stay at this hotel - it's only a 10 min walk

I really hope other Hilton's take a leaf out of this hotels 'book'.
I will definitely be returning in the summer",5,2016,02,10
120,Hilton Bankside London review,"Business trip for 9 days. This Hilton hotel is new, staff were very helpful. Good location very near the city and southbank, next to Tate modern. Rooms are good size and clean. Overall a fantastic stay.",5,2016,02,10
120,Dinner with colleagues,Had a wonderful dinner in the Exbo restaurant.  The food was superb.  We had the fillet steak with the best peppercorn sauce ever slipped down nicely with a Shiraz Malbac.  The service from the Italian waiter was wonderful and he could not do enough for us.  There is a lovely bar for pre-dinner drinks as well. a big thank you to Ben Black the account manager who showed us around the hotel.,5,2016,02,10
120,Brilliant hotel,"Stayed here for 2 nights with my boyfriend. First of all, It is quite hard to park around the area meaning we had to do the valet parking costing a whopping £40 per night! I would definitely recommend the train. That is the only fault I could find. The staff are lovely and very helpful, the breakfast is fantastic and the rooms are amazing. Huge comfy bed, large tv, brilliant shower with a bose speaker meaning you can listen to the tv whilst showering! They also provide robes and slippers which was a nice touch. We ran out of t-bags one night and after 2 minutes of us calling reception, a maid was at our door with several t-bags. Amazing service, would 100% come back here again.",5,2016,02,09
120,A new favorite in London ,"Hotel was opened in November so it had some ""child"" sickness in the start. They have shaped up now and it is a joy staying there, restaurant and bar area is nice, the gym is good and the swimming pool is nice and relaxing. Location is good too. They can still improve but I see difference from week to week  so it is getting really good.",5,2016,02,09
120,Very nice experience ,"Very nice hotel, very very new and polish. Standard rooms are well equipped and very stylish. The personal is very kind. Very nice swimming pool zone and nice fitness centre, even if a bit small. 
The structure is quite near the Tube station. 
If you are lucky you can book this hotel with very accessible prices.",4,2016,02,09
120,Superb hotel,"We stayed at the Hilton whilst attending a family wedding. From the moment we entered the hotel everything was more than could ever be expected.
The hotel is only a few months old, so everywhere is spotless. The staff all appear to be extremely proud to be there. Check in was quick, we managed to get upgraded to a 1 bedroom suite for an extra few quid, well worth the money. The lovely receptionist showed us the executive lounge and then took us to our room to ensure we were happy.
The room was spacious, spotless and had everything you could ever need. The complementary breakfast was good, and again the waiting staff were wonderful.
The icing on the cake is the location, within minutes of Borough market and the millennium bridge.
I would never fail to recommend this hotel to anyone, well worth a visit.",5,2016,02,08
120,Sunday Lunch in Restaurant,"buffet starter & dessert with unlimited Prosecco
roast beef, Yorkshire pudding, Roast Potatoes & Veg

From the minute you enter the restaurant the management and staff cannot do enough for you - although people may think £40 per head is expensive for a roast, if you view the quality on offer and amount you can have starter drink; which does retail in the bar at £10 per glass it is an amazing offer. We spent two hours in here which if we lived closer we would do on a much more regular basis - in fact I loved it so much I have booked next month for a family trip . book it you will not regret!! *NB do not use TFL Map to get there it is very confusing walk along embankment until you get to Bankside turn right and it is opposite Holiday inn Express. Enjoy.",5,2016,02,08
120,"High-quality service, excellent rooms","I stayed here over the New Year and into January for business, but have also stayed here on a few occasions since). Overall, this is a very impressive Hilton with particularly noteworthy service. 

Check-in is quick and smooth. My room was well proportioned and thought through. It had a nice day bed, as well as a comfortable desk and chair for working. The bed was incredibly comfortable and the linen high quality. The TV works well and there are also speakers in the bathroom. The room had a nice shower of the 'waterfall' variety, towels were plush. The AC is perhaps a little sensitive, but works very well indeed.

Breakfast is plentiful, has a good selection and was refilled promptly (hotel was at full capacity over NYE and although the breakfast room was busy, there were no issues). 

So far, so good. However, what stands out for me are the staff in the Distillery Bar/OXBO restaurant. The bartenders seem to really like what they do, make excellent recommendations and know their gin. However, the standout for me has been Aleksandra. Every time I've stayed, she has been incredibly friendly, remembers your order/favourite gins, etc. Once, they dimmed the lights slightly in the bar; upon noticing that I was reading, she brought me an extra candle to ensure I could see properly. Not actually required, but such a nice gesture!

Overall, this has become my new favourite Hilton for London business. ",5,2016,02,07
120,Brand new Hotel,"Nice hotel, well located near the river and brand new. They only opened a few month ago. So the bed feels great and the entire room looks immaculate.
Comfortable all around, and located in a small street, so very quiet as well. Good place to stay in London.",5,2016,02,07
120,Amazing experience,"We had two nights at the Hilton Bankside and we were blown away by the experience.  The staff were all friendly, courteous and professional.  From start to finish we felt that we had been treated to a great time.  The food was perfect every step of the way.  The choice at breakfast was second to none and beautifully presented and tasty.  We had dinner one night during our stay, which was first class.  Next time we are in London we will be making a return visit.",5,2016,02,05
120,Excellent hotel!,"Excellent accommodation, very friendly and helpful staff, breakfast was also very good. Great location, close to Southwark tube station, hence Jubilee Line, meaning just a few stops to central London. Also walking distance to Tate Modern, Millenium bridge, St. Paul's Cathedral etc. We would recommend it.",5,2016,02,05
120,Superb new Hilton!,"We stayed here in November 2015, shortly after it opened and got a special opening rate. At the price we paid I thought that value for money was fantastic. The hotel definitely deserves 5 stars: the decorations throughout the property are beautiful, the rooms are very big for London standards, location is excellent and staff were extremely helpful and polite. 

This Hilton is worlds apart from the older and outdated hotels of the same chain. I loved the design of the place, very different to what you usually find in London.

Southwark Station is less than a 5 minute walk away, from there you can catch the Jubilee Line to take you to City Airport or head to Bond Street for shopping. You can also catch the bus just outside of the hotel that takes you to Covent Garden. 

I would definitely stay here again.",5,2016,02,05
120,Great hotel let down by check-in experience,"Was very much looking forward to staying at this hotel given its location (usually I stay north of the river but increasingly enjoy visiting sights, restaurants on the South Bank). However, things did not get off to a great start...  I had called earlier to request a slightly early check-in (1-2pm) so that I could shower and change after a long haul flight and head off for a meeting at 3pm, and was told that would be no problem.  However, when I did eventually arrive at 2pm, I was told my room wasn't ready but was offered a downgrade (!) if I wanted a room immediately.  I then asked if there was somewhere I could get changed instead and was told that I could use the changing room in the Exec Lounge and so I opted for that rather than the downgraded room.  As it turned out, there was no changing room (or if there was, it was not open) and instead I had to change in the disabled toilet (of course, no shower!). So not a great start but the rest of the stay was v nice: great room with all necessary amenities (but no view really) and courteous, helpful staff (particularly in Exec Lounge at breakfast).  It is also v well located, close to Tate Modern, Millennium Bridge etc.  Notwithstanding check-in experience, I would definitely stay again (and indeed have already booked in a few weeks time)and expect to rate it higher next time.",4,2016,02,05
120,"Fantastic hotel, great value for money",We had a wonderful stay at this brand new hotel over the Christmas holiday.  As Hilton Diamond members we were upgraded to a Deluxe room (from a base room) and received complimentary breakfast and lounge access.  Service at this hotel is absolutely phenomenal - from the front desk staff to the lounge staff - we were so impressed by the sincere enthusiasm and friendliness of many of the employees here.  We also greatly appreciated the complimentary refreshments and snacks in the mini fridge in our room and the beautiful chocolate dessert we received with the turn down service on Christmas Day.  Would highly recommend this hotel and will definitely be staying here on my next visit to London!,5,2016,02,04
120,"Nice, clean, modern rooms, but poor service.","We arrived at 15:00 (check-in time) but at receptionist said that there weren't any ready room. Receptionist suggested to leave baggage and walk around a little bit, when we asked about ETA for room - the answer was ""Leave your phone number, we will call."" 

If you want to celebrate something - don't choose this hotel: in booking notes I wrote, that we celebrate our anniversary and would like some advice about good restaurant. First of all there wasn't any compliment from hotel, secondly - there wasn't any advice I requested for. Poor service for 5-star hotel, isn't it?

About ""free"" wi-fi - it's limited with speed, want unlimited - pay £9.99 per day. The internet speed was awful - it took 10-15 minutes to check email, but if you want to browse social medias or music/video - forget about it. The television (probably because of poor internet) also worked awful: 2 seconds of watching, 5 seconds of waiting to buffer.

About rooms: the rooms are clean, modern looking, but there wasn't soft drinks in refrigerator (our friends had in similar room). At night we set 29° degrees, but it was kinda chilly.

It's almost a week from our stay, but we still waiting deposit to return (£50 per night).

About breakfast: breakfast was really good, no doubts.

Place: 20 minutes from London eye, 5 minutes on cab.

Summary: good rooms, poor service, won't stay again.",3,2016,02,04
120,Enjoyable stay. ,"This is a very nice and modern hotel and the staff are very good and attentive. Good value for money and in a good location. 
 However, the room was not cleaned to a very high standard as others peoples rubbish was still in our room. Overall good hotel. ",4,2016,02,04
120,Good Hotel - But Not Great,"We spent 5 days at this hotel in January.  It does a lot of things right.  But it has a few glaring problems.

Let's start with the good: 
The Executive Lounge staff was outstanding.  Very warm, helpful and generous.  We found the same experience with the staff of OXBO and The Distillery.  So whoever is training these employees should get a gold star. The Executive Lounge was a very comfortable room and environment. The food offerings for pretty good.  
The food and beverage offerings in OXBO and The Distillery were above average for a chain hotel restaurant.
In our Junior Suite room, the bed was very comfortable - on par with Westin's ""Heavenly Beds.""  The room was also very quite with no street or ""room to room"" noise.  The shower had great water pressure and had no problem getting hot water.  Bath tub was a good size for soaking.
The doorman and bellmen were helpful, charming and courteous.
The concierge was very helpful and generous with restaurant advice and reservations.
The hotel feels secure. Room keys are required to get to any floor via the elevator. 

Now the areas that need improvement.
There is no place to plug in the hair dryer (that is provided by the hotel) in the bathroom.  Yes, you heard that correctly. They forgot to put an outlet for a hair dryer in the bathroom.  What is worse, is that where there is an outlet in the writing desk in the room, there is no mirror.  So how are you supposed to do your hair and make up??????  (This is what you get when you let a man design a hotel)  At least they provided a small mirror to our room when we pointed this out.
Our Junior Suite was pretty small.  It looked like just a regular room with a couch.
The reception staff was extremely cold and stiff.  The exact opposite of the staff in food service.  Even the supervisors were very short to their subordinates in front of guests.  Poor training and poor leadership.",4,2016,02,03
120,My new favourite hotel in London,"My first review on tripadvisor, prompted by having such an enjoyable stay - was there for 3 nights for a conference, but my wife was able to join me for 2 nights too.  I booked a king deluxe suite in the winter sale, and would highly recommend it, especially given the more reasonable price than many inferior hotels around London.

Greated at the front desk by Jan, who was lovely.  The décor is more modern than most Hilton's I've been to, which was great.  Its only 3 months old, but it is very clean and tidy.  The suite was fantastic, with a very comfy bed, a large bathroom (with WC, shower, separate bath), separate WC beside door, sofa and armchairs and two TVs, all in separate sleeping/relaxing areas. Minibar had a nice selection, with soft drinks and snacks complimentary.  The TV reception was a bit dodgy at times, and some friends in the hotel at the same time seemed to have worse reception than my room.

Tried out the gym - smallish, but as I was the only one there I had plenty of room.  Different cardio machines to try, some free weights and one or two weights/cable machines.  I didn't get to try the pool unfortunately, but it looked very inviting.

The lounge was fantastic, and I must praise Philippe - he provided the best customer service in a hotel that I can remember.  A great selection of drinks in the evening and snacks, in a very nicely designed and spacious area.

Highly recommend breakfast - great choice, including pancakes, waffles or omelettes made for you, plus selection of hot food, pastries, cereal, bread, fruit, yoghurt, meats and cheese.  I didn't have the same problem a previous review had on a sunday morning - it was busier than the other days, but my food was still hot.

The bar was pleasant for a few drinks, though we were caught out by it closing at midnight on Saturday. Unfortunately we weren't told about this, so missed a chance for last orders.  It also seemed an odd decision, as it was still pretty busy, and more people kept trying to come in, so they seemed to do themselves out of a reasonable amount of business.

The staff were all very polite, and seemed genuinely pleased to hear I had enjoyed myself.  They also seemed rather proud of their hotel, which was very refreshing compared to some of the places I've stayed.

5 mins walk from Southwark on the Jubilee line, various supermarkets within 1-2 mins walk.  I hadn't really stayed in this area of London before, but found it very nice exploring new places.

I am already looking forward to my next stay in May, and am considering booking another stay sooner than that, as my wife also enjoyed it so much.  I might even start staying here for my regular meetings, rather than around Euston, and just getting the tube up.",5,2016,02,02
120,A lot of room for improvement,"I'm usually not too picky about hotels - a year ago I stayed at the CitizenM down the block and thought it was a fantastic hotel - the customer service was superb 

I was really excited about the Hilton Bankside after reading all the positive reviews. Unfortunately my experience was just no where near worth the money. Most of the outlets in the room did not work, there was no hot water, only warm (I confirmed this with my coworker), the room had a funny smell and after being cleaned the smell of cleaning product was just ridiculous. The cleaning staff and front desk staff appeared to  be friendly but were extremely sarcastic in their responses (Maybe this is a UK thing but it was contradictory to my stay at the CitizenM which had the most helpful staff). The first night my phone randomly rang in the middle of the night and someone knocked on my door - my blow dryer took hours to bring...it was not an amazing stay to say the least...

On one plus side - the gym attendant was really nice and I did enjoy having a fitness facility in the hotel 

I would definitely not return here",2,2016,02,02
120,Fantastic Food,"We tend to book hotels not just for their location but also for the menu and we were delighted to find that the quality of the food was outstanding. Thoroughly enjoyed the Casterbridge Steak and the Shoulder of Lamb, the desserts were bliss. Wonderful selection of bread and pastries served with breakfast. Can really recommend.",5,2016,02,02
120,Great for a city break,"The hotel exceeded expectations and really delivered on value for the room booking. It was great in terms of service, comfort and aesthetics. We stayed for one night and were sad to leave. Given it is a fairly new hotel, everything was very high quality and in good condition and I'd like to return to be able to try more of the amenities.",5,2016,02,02
120,Wonderful weekend break,"This brand new hotel is beautifully appointed - fantastic comfortable bed and walk-in shower - room and bathroom larger than is often the case in a London hotel.  Mild problem in that there was no internet/WIFI/TV/radio access Saturday evening or Sunday morning, but we were told this was a teething problem, a one-off (the hotel has only been open a few months).  Not a problem for us as we were on vacation but would be extremely annoying, potentially, for a business traveller.",4,2016,02,02
120,5 star experience ,"The hotel is in an excellent location for sight seeing, a five minute walk from the tube and within walking distance for many London attractions
The hotel is new and the decor is clean and modern. All the staff were very friendly and attentive, giving you the impression that no request would be too much..
We stayed in an executive King room which was very clean and spacious. The bed was huge and the most comfortable one I've ever slept in. 
We dined in the restaurant and the food was delicious. The choices for breakfast were vast and beautifully presented. Again the staff were very attentive and the chefs cooked many extra items to order. 
All in all I had a fantastic stay in this hotel and would highly recommend it.
",5,2016,02,01
120,Excellent hotel few improvements and it would be perfect,"Just got back after a two nights stay and our third London stay in 3 months. This hotel was cheaper than the last two and delivered more. The bed was very comfortable, the room was spacious and the bathroom was luxurious. On the improvement side, there is no mirror in the bedroom so its impossible for women to sit and dry hair. I asked at checkout why and was told that if I had asked for one they could provide one!! The seat at the desk doesnt move easily and comes apart when you lift it. We came back on our first day to relax in our room before going out again in the evening and our room had not been refreshed so it was 2pm before we got back in and could chill out. 
We will definately stay again.",4,2016,01,31
120,A very special stay,"Hilton Bankside
Stayed for 3 nights in January. 5 min walk from Southwark tube station on Jubilee line. The hotel interior decor is quite special.  Recently opened in October 2015, this hotel is modern and luxurious throughout, particularly the lobby, our large shower room & the executive lounge. 
The fabulous Hilton breakfast kept us going all day. However, there seems to be a problem keeping the cooked breakfast items warm as ours were cold on 2 out of 3 mornings. Beautiful pastries and a varied selection of fruit or yogurt meant there was plenty choice. There was a noticeable deterioration on Sunday morning when shelves and baskets etc were not refilled resulting in a far limited choice. We were also shown to a table that had not been cleared or set for us. 
We arrived on Friday afternoon and the pool was unfortunately closed 'for cleaning' not opening again until Saturday afternoon. It was also closed on Sunday at 9:10 pm despite the room information describing it open every day until 10pm.
Many previous reviewers have mentioned the attentive staff and for us this was Ana who secured our pre arrival requests via email and Phillipe & Atajan in the exec lounge during our stay. However, every staff member we were in contact with was polite, helpful and smiling.
There is plenty to do in this area of London within walking distance. Many good eating places and bars very close by. Tesco, Sainsbury's and Costa within a few strides on the same street for those who are not enjoying the Hilton breakfast. It would be easy to remain within the hotel as the restaurant and bar are large, comfortable and very welcoming.
We used complimentary room wifi with no speed or connection issues. All room facilities were modern, very comfortable bed, great fridge and very prompt delivery of different pillows when requested. Plenty toiletries (replenished daily), slippers and dressing gowns.
I will definitely return to this hotel and have already recommended it to friends. Highly recommended despite the few minor issues I have mentioned. Book it - you'll not be disappointed. (Hilton members - free to join - can get a better room rate by booking on Hilton website.)",5,2016,01,31
120,Room for improvements but very nice hotel,"I couldn’t fault the customer service at the hotel and the facilities were very nice. Stayed in one of their suites, I would have expected more accessories in the suite - hair dryer etc. Very nice room nevertheless. Executive access provided nice food and attentive staff. Television didn’t work all night in our room, when called the reception, the lady laughed which didn’t impress me.. I wasn’t asked about my stay on check out so I wasn’t able to voice my opinions unfortunately",4,2016,01,31
120,Wanted to give 5 stars!,"We arrived very early but we were able to check in which was nice and unexpected.  We had an upgrade to a one bedroom suite (£15 extra), but that meant that we had to wait for the bedding to be changed to non-feather, so we were able to wait in the lovely executive lounge with a nice cup of coffee.

The room on the 5th floor was lovely, light and airy but not a great view. We waited for our luggage to be brought up, but when there was no sign of it we rang down to request it.  They phoned us back twice as it appeared that our luggage had gone missing!  They were about to go over the CCTV footage when it arrived at our room.  I do not know exactly what happened but it made the arrival rather stressful!

The room was nice with good facilities however there were very limited supplies of coffee pods, and no decaf pods - I did ask one of the cleaners for some but none arrived.  The design of the room though could do with a little thought - there was nowhere with a plug to use as a dressing table for hair drying/straightening.  You have to open the wardrobe door to use one of the mirrors on the inside of the door and use a plug by the skirting board next to the wardrobe.  This means having to put the straighteners/ hair dryer on the floor.  Not ideal!

Returning to the hotel late at night after the theatre and a meal out we had an accident with a broken glass in the bathroom - housekeeping were quick to respond and dealt with it quickly and without fuss or causing us extra embarrassment.  For that I thank them!

I woke in the morning, on the extremely comfortable bed, wheezing and coughing and  on further investigation, although the duvet and pillows had been changed to feather free, they had neglected to change the mattress topper!!!!  I did mention this at checkout and a promise was made to talk to housekeeping and make sure this didn't happen again.  We will see.

Breakfast in the executive lounge was lovely, plentiful and the staff very helpful.  The pastries were delicious, although the scrambled egg looked very suspect and really not cooked properly so was avoided. 

We didn't get a chance to try the pool, but maybe on the next visit......

Unfortunately, the lost luggage, room design and mainly the feather free bedding error have reduced my rating to 4 stars.",4,2016,01,31
120,Excellent Hotel,"Really great hotel, with lovely staff who were eager to help if needed. Facilities were excellent, and the location is not too far away from the hub of the city. Would definitely stay here again, without any hesitation! And will be recommending it to all family and friends.",5,2016,01,31
120,"Modern, tidy and well organised","A very good hotel for anyone. Customer service is amazing, rooms clean and facilities just fabulous. I found the executive lounge they offered very attractive and a good additional choice; you can eat and drink as much as you want to. The atmosphere is relaxed but prestigious which makes the space great for, e.g., planning your day in London or for winding out for a moment.",5,2016,01,31
120,Perfect in every way,"We spent  3 nights in this fabulous hotel and were very satisfied on every count . We snatched a great deal on the Hilton website points +cash and were able to access the executive lounge for an extra 35£ a day for 2  . This was an excellent choice as breakfast, afternoon tea and pre dinner canapés and drinks are served very generously. There was really no need to eat outside. The minibar in the room was free (non alcoholic) and replenished daily

The room is modern with the Hilton signature bed which is just perfect .  Turndown service is offered in the evening. The staff is excellent and always happy to help. Most of them speak French 

There is a lovely pool 17 meters long and a jaccuzzi which is nice after a day out. The gym is equipped with three treadmills , elliptic machine, bike and weights . Water is available.
We also loved the area especially the borough market and the fact that the banks were a great running ground. 

If you travel with the Eurostar, the 2 for 1 offer for  all museums exhibitions is available. Print the offer on the Eurostar website as most museums are not aware of it.",5,2016,01,29
120,Nice new hilton,"A nice new Hilton staff seem very interested in customer service, lounge is good with plenty of seating, breakfast was good however staff still seem to be learning what to do however that said they could not do more to help you. Pool is good, fitness room a bit small but was ok when I stayed as I was the only one using it. So why not 5 rating, two reasons one is staff are still learning what to do and that shows, and our room overlooked the railway line which kept us awake, also the mini bar made a noise I could not turn it off so with the trains and mini bar it was not a good nights sleep",4,2016,01,27
120,Definitely 5 star,"We stayed in January and only intended staying one night but we were so impressed with the facilities and staff, that we stayed another night. It was a special occasion and Shrina  and Per helped to make my weekend special.  I would highly recommend this hotel and have already.  The rooms are lovely, the leisure facilities excellent, the restaurant and bar great and the staff exceptional.  There is so much to do within walking distance and it makes a good base for a weekend in London.  We will be back.",5,2016,01,27
120,Best London Hotel,"Stayed for a weekend (Sat/Sun night), This hotel from the moment you check-in to when you leave is excellent. On arrival we paid for a upgrade to a 1 bed suite and have to say the room was perfect, large bedroom, bathroom and good size living room with great view of the Shard. The bed was super comfy and the décor was modern and so clean. We also had use of the executive lounge with buffet breakfast and snacks and canopies throughout the day, Staff are super polite and nothing a problem for them. Have to say after quite a lot of overnight and weekend stays in London this is definitely the best hotel we have stayed at for everything, (even stayed at the Waldorf and this is way nicer). Also the best Hilton hotel we have stayed at anywhere in the world. Whatever they are doing here is right and others should take note.

Absolutely awesome hotel and not to far from everything as Southwark tube station a short walk away",5,2016,01,27
120,Hilton London Bankside - brilliant!!,"We stayed here for one Saturday night in January 2016.  

On arrival we were met by Jan who very promptly acknowledged our reservation and then after a short chat explaining the reason for our trip were offered (for a small additional fee) an upgrade for a suite and use of the Executive Lounge.  The suite was not quite ready but no problem as Jan (who was excellent) said we could have an afternoon tea in the Lounge with the upgrade.

Room (suite) was excellent on top (7th floor).  Nice lounge, huge shower, super big (and very comfy) King bed.  Behind the curtains clear views of the Shard! It was so quiet also - no internal or exterior noise at all during our stay.

We used the lounge for pre dinner drinks/canapes.  The waiters were very punctual and nothing was a problem.  Post dinner we had a couple of G&Ts in the hotel bar - what a selection of gins - the barman seemed to know his gins and was very happy to recommend.

Following morning breakfast in lounge was good.  We went for a brief tour and saw the gym/pool which looked great (next time!).  Pool - perfectly big enough for a good swim and the gym had very good quality machines.  All areas were spotless.

The location of this hotel is also very good.  Just over 5 mins walk to the nearest tube, South Bank, Tate Modern and Millenium Bridge (leading straight to St Pauls).  London Bridge/Borough Market/Shard around 15 minute walk east and London Eye/Westminster Bridge/Houses of Parliament 20 minute walk west.

Plenty of shops/restaurants/cafes very near the hotel.

I suspect this hotel is perfectly suitable for business as well as leisure.

Can't rate our visit high enough and hope to return one day.  Thanks to Jan and Hilton London Bankside for a great stay.",5,2016,01,26
120,Cool and fantastic!,"Me and my husband stayed for two nights at Hilton Bankside.
The hotel is well located to nearest subway station with a 5 minute walk.
It has a very cool interior design, fantastic service minded staff and a nice breakfast.
We loved our room and the restaurant, didn't have a chanse to try the bar but we´ll do it the next time we visit. Cause we will visit Hilton Bankside again!
The only thing we could have asked for was a little more light in the room cause it was a little dark but that was not a big thing.
I will highly recommend this to you all!!",5,2016,01,26
120,Weekend stay,"My wife & l stayed here a couple of weeks a go on a weekend theatre break & everything about this place was superb. The staff were very attentive & wanted to make sure our stay was a great experience .We did not have an evening meal in the hotel restaurant but had the breakfast which had a wide range of choices from traditional cooked english breakfast to continental style.
On both mornings there we managed to have a swim before breakfast in the hotel pool & again the facilities were superb & spotlessly clean. We found the hotel to be in a great location with it been only five to ten minute walk from Southwark tube station on the Jubilee Line. Also the Tate Modern is only a short walk away along with the Shard & Globe theatre. We found the Strand on the other side of the Thames to be about a twenty five minute walk.",5,2016,01,25
120,Perfect,"A warm welcome and great service.  Room was very clean with great facilities and very quiet with no noise from other rooms, hallway or outside. Hotel was perfect for our trip to the globe theatre. Recommend the valet parking, so easy and probably cheaper than train tickets in to London.  Breakfast was amazing, with so much choice and realistic serving times (6am to 11am). ",5,2016,01,25
120,Practically perfect in every way!,"Nothing bad to day about this hotel. It looks and feels very posh, modern and stylish. The staff are very polite and helpful. It is perfectly located in the centre of London, close to Southwark tube station which is just a few stops from all major attractions etc. We were very impressed with the price as well. We had breakfast which was lovely.",5,2016,01,25
120,London for Business,The Hilton Bankside is a beautiful new hotel.  The minute you walk in there is a calm and relaxed atmosphere.  The staff have been trained to high standards and are extremely friendly and professional.  Working in Southwark street the hotel is an ideal place to stay.  The internet facilities and desk unit in the room makes it very easy to work in the comfort of your room.  The bathroom and bed are of very good quality and the room is clean and with no excess noises from other rooms or the road.  All in all a very pleasant stay.,4,2016,01,25
120,Fabulous experience,"From our warm welcome in the wonderful lobby, next the fabulous room, its only been open a few months and the attention to detail is great. we had drinks in the bar along with very tasty appetisers, during the evening the bar got busier and busier and the atmosphere was very good.
We slept well on the extremely comfortable bed, the room had everything you need.
A very warm welcome at breakfast and a vast choice. all staff we met were eager to please and very friendly.
Saw the pool but did not use it also saw the executive lounge which we would certainly hope to book next time.
The hotel is in such a convenient place and once London Bridge station re=opens fully in the summer its a few minutes walk from the hotel.
Would not hesitate to stay again.",5,2016,01,25
120,Fantastic comfort,"Last minute booking for work 2 day conference.  Fantastic quality in room, bedding and bathroom recently refurbished so very new and fresh but far superior or former Limdon experience.  Bags to room Nd personal attention showing all room facilities - highly recommended - late night bar at very reasonable cost.  A must reservation wether business or pleasure.",5,2016,01,25
120,Louise,"This hotel offered a great base in which to sightsee around London.It also is a hotel that has fabulous compliment of staff that could not do enough for you.Impeccable cleanliness, beds so comfortable and executive package wonderful if you are looking for the relaxing element after a busy sightseeing day. Highly recommend this hotel😃",5,2016,01,24
120,Ursula,"We stayed in the Hilton London Bankside for the weekend and it was fantastic. The location of the hotel is excellent, it's within walking distance of many local attractions and a short journey in to central London. The staff here are fantastic, very friendly, courteous and helpful and our room was stunning. The hotel itself is modern and extremely stylish and the food was amazing. We'll definitely be coming again, thank you London Hilton Bankside for making our weekend so special. ",5,2016,01,24
120,Great hotel and friendly staff!,"I am staying at this hotel for business for seven days and my stay has been fantastic.  The staff are all very friendly, executive lounge for diamond members is great (they could do a better breakfast) and rooms are new and large for Europe.  I am extremely happy with this hotel.  Oh, and great bar!  I usually stay at the Waldorf when I come to London, but I am pretty sure I have a new hotel.",5,2016,01,23
120,Excellent First Stay,"This was our first time staying in a Hilton, and our first impression was excellent.  The front destk staff remembered our name, and even though we arrived hours before our check in time, they made getting our room ready a priority and phone me to tell me the room was ready, depite still being several hours before check in time.  The rooms were well thought out in terms of design, comortable and had an adequate amount of space for 2 adults.  Excellent service, quality and location.",5,2016,01,23
120,Excellent hotel in brilliant location,"Very modern hotel with classy decor throughout. We stayed in an executive room which lived up to its billing. The restaurant and bar were first class and lively. The Exec Lounge is worth it for a chill out. Very attentive staff, quick to respond to any problem. We were going to The Globe Theatre and doing a long walk on The Thames. Location was perfect for this. This hotel will definitely be our hotel of choice for central London stays.",5,2016,01,22
120,Great service in a London bar Thanks Shrina.,"Nice room with slate shower... BUT the real treat was great service and the staff in the Distillery Bar in the lobby. Three of us arrived around 10 pm and never had to wait for another drink all the way to last call.. Shrina was supper helpful suggesting beers, and made sure we felt welcome.. Thanks Hilton for a great evening and Thanks Shrina for friendly service, you made the evening fun..",4,2016,01,21
120,"Excellent hotel, great faculties, location and staff","We stayed here for two weeks from early January and it was fantastic. Great gym and pool as well as sizeable rooms.  The staff were fantastic, particularly Anthony at reception. Nothing was too much trouble for them.  There are excellent restaurants close by and it is an easy walk to the tube. We will definitely return. Great value for money.",5,2016,01,21
120,My hotel of choice in London,"I cannot simply agree with those who have said they were underwhelmed or unimpressed with this hotel. This is by far the best hotel I have stayed in, not just in London, but across Europe and the USA.

Put simply, these guys care. That's why I return. If something is wrong, they put it right. You just have to let them know. This is now my 10th stay at the hotel since it opened and I have never come across a place where they truly care about you. 

This stay was for a birthday celebration and there were little treats in the room on arrival and even a complimentary upgrade. Rooms are spacious, most with walk in showers, however some do have separate bathrooms as well. I was in a one-bedroom suite - simply stunning with a really comfortable (and separate) lounge and dining area, through a door way into a lovely bedroom with a gorgeous king bed, egyptian cotton bedding and the best sleep I have had (which was comforting when you're suffering with a cold) and one of the biggest bathrooms I have ever seen in London! Wow! 

The hotel comes with a 30m indoor pool and jacuzzi which is luxuriously warm (and often empty). If you stay in a suite or executive room, you have access to the best executive lounge I have come across, with such attentive staff you'd think you were at The Savoy.

If you are staying at the weekend, you have to try the Sunday Lunch Buffet. Simply beautiful food for an amazingly good price of £28 including a glass of prosecco.

Yes there maybe other hotels in London that offer boutique, chic, or tradition, but this hotel surpasses all that I have stayed at. Why - because the staff care, and you feel part of a family here. Can wait to return!",5,2016,01,19
120,Underwhelmed ,"I was really looking forward to trying this hotel as colleagues had recommended it to me; unfortunately I was not impressed at all and left bitterly disappointed. On check-in I asked for a room with a bath which was denied and I was made to feel like a nuisance for even asking - I should mention I'm a Diamond HHonors member. I was upgraded to a Deluxe room but noted better rooms showing available, once again I was refused anything better. The breakfast in the main restaurant was chaotic and clearly understaffed - we were made to wait an age before being seated and the place was only half-full. The food itself was nice but you had to wait for everything as the buffet was depleted. I overheard the staff commenting that it was always like this for Sunday breakfast as 'nobody wants to work'. The Executive Lounge was the saving feature - really good service and a nice space and atmosphere. The final disappointment was that I left comments about my stay and nobody has bother to follow up with me. ",3,2016,01,18
120,"New hotel, fab service","We went on a date night and were looked after. We had a deluxe room which was very comfortable. We had wine and nibbles in the Distillery which was delicious and the staff, especially Ana L, were excellent. Breakfast was of a very high standard. I love the mixture of stone and carpet. We will be back",5,2016,01,18
120,Fab weekend,"just had a fab weekend here and could not find any faults at all.All staff friendly and informative.Shrina in the bar was exceptional as was Per on reception.Breakfast was unbeatable and Dinner was very good.The deluxe room was great and we enjoyed the spa.In a very good location for Borough Market,The Globe Theatre and much more.",5,2016,01,18
120,A real pleasure,"My wife and I stay at Hiltons all around the world. What marks this hotel out is the happy, smiling helpful professional staff team. Nothing was too much trouble and everyone seemed to be enjoying themselves. Clearly a tribute to the staff election and training that has been done on our behalf. 
If there is one small criticism it was that our room, although very well appointed and serviced was dark and  need the lights on even during the day. We did enquire and there are rooms with more windows but it is not something that you would normally ask for.

Well done Hilton Bankside and Thank you",5,2016,01,18
120,Brilliant stay in this great new Hilton!,"We have just enjoyed a lovely weekend staying at the Hilton in Bankside. This is a true 5 star Hilton. Extremely friendly staff from check in until checkout. We used the pool facilities which are incredibly clean and modern, with nice touches such as complimentary water and modern locking lockers. 

Our ""King Guestroom"" was lovely. A comfortable King size bed with beautiful sheets. Modern design and large walk-in shower in the bathroom. Robes included also (5 star touch)

The public areas in the hotel are also incredibly fresh and clean with a stylish bar beside checkin. Prices are steep but this is to be expected at a good London hotel, so no complaint there.

Good location.

I will certainly be back. Other Hilton hotels should learn from this one. A fantastic experience!",5,2016,01,17
120,"New Hotel, Excellent Service","This was a short three night getaway visit.  I usually stay at one of the Hilton brands and most of the other locations were a bit on the expensive side so I thought I would give this new hotel a shot.  And I am glad I did.

Arrived around noon and greeted by a very enthusiastic desk clerk who told me I had been upgraded to a King Deluxe Room which apparently means it is on a higher floor.  The standard and deluxe rooms look to be the same physically apart from location in the hotel.  The rooms are really dark but all very nice.  Beds are extremely comfortable and the chaise lounge by the window is comfortable as well and really nice for relaxing.   Decent selection of TV channels.  Wifi worked fine but I really did not put much demand on it.  Minibar has space for a few items that you may bring into the hotel which is a nice.  The bathrooms are wonderful and the rain shower quite relaxing.  It is all really standard Hilton in a nice, new package.

The service really stood out at the hotel.  Everyone seemed to be very enthusiastic and happy to be working there.   The turndown service and room refresh each evening was a very nice touch and something that you normally don’t find at a Hilton.  I didn’t use the restaurant/lounge or the pool or really ask for much service for that matter.  Service was prompt and friendly the few times I asked for it.

The location is good.  Not as convenient to the West End as a lot of other hotels but fine as long as you allow a little extra time to get where you are going.  On the flip, the location is very convenient to everything on the South Bank and I hit a number of sights simply because they were right there.  The neighborhood used to be sleepy but not so much anymore.  There are a number of decent restaurants and grocery options nearby.  

One final tip – know the address of the hotel if taking a cab.  The hotel is so new that a lot of cab drivers don’t know it exist or at least they didn’t as of November 2015.

If you are fine with staying on the South Bank, this is an very good hotel with excellent service and I highly recommend it.  I know I will be back.",5,2016,01,17
120,"New hotel, comfortable ","This is a hotel that has only been open for a few months. It smells lovely on entry and the check in was quick, several desks and staff are helpful and friendly. The only downside is that the bar was closed after 12 so after we returned from dinner there wasn't an option for a nightcap ",4,2016,01,17
120,"Perfect girlie weekend, special thanks to Pers","This was a wonderful stay. Thanks to my Dismond status we had beautiful rooms with access to the executive lounge.
The hotel is vibrant and new but its greatest asset is its staff.
Smiling, helpful, cheerful, they are great ambassadors for this new Hilton and the Hilton brand.
Bedrooms were clean with comfortable beds and good sized bathrooms. Bed linen was beautiful and we all had a good night's sleep
The executive lounge served a lovely afternoon tea and the evening canapés and prosecco were  fabulous.
Breakfast offered a good choice with cook to order items available
Pers was a delight and very chatty.
Really impressed and we all felt welcomed and pampered.
Lovely lovely lovely.
Thank you",5,2016,01,17
120,Everything as you'd expect at Hilton,"I've stayed twice on business now. This is a new hotel and nicely furnished / finished.  Rates depend on when you stay - very expensive at c 269£ midweek whereas a definite deal at 118£ weekends. Expect these to rise. 

Local area is quiet but you can walk to a selection of chain restaurants / pubs or just stroll along the Thames.  You are five minutes walk from Southwark tube station. 

I'd happily go back if the rates were right.  Oh snd it would be great if wifi was faster - standard version is good enough for email but forget video.  Premium is £10 per day - pity they still charge for a basic service like this.",5,2016,01,16
120,"excellent service, excellent food, great bar, all new facilities","I have been staying with this hotel three times, between October 2015 and January 2016. A colleague recommended this hotel, and I can confirm that this is a great place to stay at, with reasonable pricing also.

The rooms are big enough, including nice gimmicks like international power outlets on the desk, and nice showers in the bathroom. I did not use the pool yet, so cannot comment on this one.

The staff is going to great lengths to fulfill every request you have. The Concierge did a good job helping to retrieve my luggage that had been lost in transit, and obviously all the smaller requests they handle fast and reliable also.
The team is very international, so you will probably find someone who is fluent in your mother tongue among them. You will realize how much they enjoy their jobs there; even if you had a bad day, they will make you smile.

I recommend you check out their Bar ""The Distillery"". They have two very knowledgeable italian Barkeepers, who will surprise you with excellent drinks. I hosted a business guest there one evening, and they kept coming up with excellent recommendations on local and international Gins - which they specialize in, no matter whether it's pure, as a Fizz, with Tonic, or as a crazy Cocktail creation.
Go there and have an amazing evening.
Breakfast at the restaurant is also excellent, and I recommend to get up early to spend a bit more time with this excellent breakfast buffet,

The surroundings offer a couple of Dining options also, so within a 5min walk you have plenty of choice whether you want some Sushi, Pizza or even a custom Burger, it's all around the corner.
Southwark Tube station is a 5min walk from the hotel. From there you get basically everywhere.

This hotel delivers good value for a reasonable amount of money, and they do deliver on high expectations every time. You will want to stay there.",5,2016,01,16
120,Brilliant hotel,Stayed at the Hilton Bankside for New Year and had a brilliant time. The staff were amazing and couldn't do enough for you. You would expect the rooms to be nice as this hotel is new but they were really lovely. Breakfast was great and again staff were so good. You can easily walk into central London in 20 mins.  Can't wait to go back!,5,2016,01,16
120,Good Hotel with Pool,Had a reason to stay in this area and found this hotel by luck.  Chose it due to having a swimming pool.  The room was well furnished and clean with a good sized bathroom (no bath but large wet area).  Do not expect a view but that was fine for us as the inside room was very quiet.  The pool itself was good but not overly big; 3 or 4 swimmers doing lengths would be max although it was only us when we used it so not a problem.  Gym facilities looked pretty good too but no sauna or steam room.  Wifi free for HHonours holders.,4,2016,01,15
120,Excellent Hotel Choice For London 4.5/5,"I'm a little slow in getting a review up, but this hotel is definitely worth saying something good about, especially since finding a decent hotel in London that is also affordable is a challenge. I stayed at the Hilton Bankside for 6 nights on business and thoroughly enjoyed my stay. It's located south of the Thames and within 3 or 4 minutes walk to Southwark Tube Station (Jubilee Line) or a bit longer walk the other way to Millennium Bridge and access to the area around St.Paul's.  The neighbourhood is very nice with plenty of choices for restaurants, pubs, grocery stores, banks etc. The first thing you notice when you enter the hotel is there are staff everywhere-all very friendly and eager to help. The lobby is large with lots of seating and immediately adjacent to a large lounge/bar area. The hotel motif is a bit strange-kind of a modern hunting lodge with lots of wood (which smells nice) and stylized animal head artwork-interesting! Check-in was quick and easy and several lifts are available so there was never any waiting. The room had a king bed and while the bedroom area was not big by North American standards, it was a good size for London. The bathroom though, was huge with a roomy shower and lots of space around the sink for sundries. And face cloths too! The king bed was very comfortable, as were the pillows.  There was a nice work space and good size flatscreen TV along with a fridge and coffee/tea maker. No room for any other chairs or small couch though. The internet was the only thing I was disappointed in. The free wifi was slow, running at about 2 Mbps down and up, and the premium (pay) wifi only ran at between 5 and 6 Mbps down and up. The speed for the free wifi could be tolerated, but the speed for the pay service was unacceptable in this day and age in a new hotel. My only gripe! The very large restaurant and included breakfast were fabulous and the food excellent. Despite my disappointment with the wifi, this really is a very nice hotel and one of my favourite choices so far in London-highly recommended.",4,2016,01,14
120,New year,"Nice hotel.  I spilt a cup of tea on the bed, asked for the bedding to be replaced which was totally ignored.  Expected better house keeping in such an expensive hotel. Disappointing. Check in was easy, and the reception staff were friendly",4,2016,01,14
120,Nice New Hotel,"Would give this place “4.5 stars” if possible, it’s a very good new hotel in a good location. Review based on a one night stay in January (background of spending 80+ nights per year in different hotels around the globe). 

Location:
Due to late arrival I had little time to check out the surroundings but at least a bunch cafés, restaurants and convenience stores are within stone’s throw. And it’s a walking distance to many major sights in London (like Tate, Millennium bridge, Globe and Shard) so I’m sure there’s plenty to do here.  

Multiple railway & tube stations in the area so connecting to the other parts of London (and the rest of UK) is easy. 

Room:
Had a room at 5th floor which had a nice modern stylish décor, almost luxurious. Especially the bathroom resembled me of the high-end Asian hotels. Everything was spotlessly clean with no signs of usage (no surprise there given the age of the hotel). Size of the room was also good, not superbly spacious but certainly more than enough for me.  

Standard equipment such as LCD TV and coffee maker included. A selection of soft drinks & nuts was complimentary, a nice addition!  

Very little noise from either inside or outside the hotel. 

Etc: 
Very good breakfast, one of the best I’ve encountered in London. Large selection of warm and cold offerings, especially the variety of different pastries was impressive. 

Fast and friendly check-in & out

Would I return there?
Yes, for sure. A nice new hotel in a good location. In fact I already have a room booked for my next trip to London!",4,2016,01,14
120,"Its true, the staff are AMAZING.","I stayed at this hotel after a night out in London. This particular establishment was very clean and pleasant. The rooms were relatively small but were very comfortable and relatively beautiful. What stood out to me during my stay was the staff. As other before me have mentioned, the staff in this hotel are genuinely Wonderfull.  I was welcomed and checked in by the lovely receptionist Kiana Cho who was very friendly and helpful. She is one of the, if not THE most friendliest, most welcoming receptionist I have ever come across. At the bar, we were presented with exquisite cocktails by a remarkable bartender (who sounded, I believe Italian). Other staff such as the waiter who served us at the bar, and the concierge were all wonderful and really made our stay that much better. Hats off to the managers at this Hilton branch for picking amazing staff.",5,2016,01,13
120,Celebration Stay,"In November my husband and myself stayed here with friends to celebrate there  40th Wedding Anniversary.
The Hotel was in a very good location to get around London, the room were very clean and had everything we needed.
The package I booked included a free drink, it was lovely to start of the evening with a glass of Champagne before we went out.
The staff were very friendly and booked us a local taxis to get to our boat, which we were booked on the the Saturday evening.
I would definately recommend this Hotel to anyone staying in London.",5,2016,01,13
120,Superbly appointed brand new hotel with great location,"The hotel instantly impressed us with its gorgeous lobby and super friendly staff. Our room was beautifully appointed and the bathroom is modern, edgy and sleek. We were a little surprised though, that in GB there are no power points allowed in the bathroom but unfortunately the hotel has not taken this in consideration, with  two women trying to their hair in the bedroom with no mirror only having the TV reflection to use. There is another mirror inside the wardrobe door but no power plug inside only opposite in the other wall...
The executive lounge is just divine, we loved the open fire and the most comfortable armchairs. Afternoon tea was lovely only to be disappointed with the offerings for cocktail time. Plenty of crudites and dips and nuts but in comparison to many other Hilton lounges nothing substantial enough, considering the extra price tag for the lounge. 
Breakfast though was again a hit, lots of different cold and warm dishes with egg dishes being made a la minute. We had three nights and unfortunately the Sunday morning staff really seemed run off their feet and lots of areas on the buffet nor refilled quick enough and the line up for people being seating way to long. Even there was not enough staff, the customer should not feel that and it seems the girls were  very stressed and it really showed in customer service. On the other hand, service on the other two days were perfect, when Alex, was more than accommodating, also asking us about our stay and it seemed nothing was to much for him to do. 
All in all, I can really recommend this property, the staff seemed genuinely friendly and of course it's only a few months old. I would definitely return.",4,2016,01,13
120,Theatre Trip,Very welcoming helpful and friendly staff.Clean rooms and comfy beds. Ideal for visiting places of interest and Southbank. Waterloo station within walking distance also The Oxo Tower for  pre Theatre drinks or a meal. Would definitely stay here again.,5,2016,01,12
120,"Excellent hotel, Best team serving clients","I stayed in this hotel five nights and followiing are my comments:
- New hotel (3/4 months old) in the reviatalised Southwark side of the Thames. This is quite convenient whether you are on busiiness or leisure. The train Station is rouond the corner and Thames walk, a stone's throw away with St Paul Cathedral, Westminister and Tower of London in walking distance.
- All amenities are new, modern and in working order. For those who visit London would appreciate what it means. All areas f the hotels are clean and fresh.
- The staff (the whole team) is very courteous and effcient which makes this hotel stand out. They make extra efforts to remember your name and speak to you to make you feel comfortable. Mihai and his team from the front office , Michaela from the restaurant and her team from the restaurant, Rahul and Alex, the two duty managers are truly hardworking professionals. Concierge too very helpful and knowledgable.
I must recoemnd this hotel to anyone who is looking for than just the valuue for money.",5,2016,01,12
120,Outstanding - as good as is looks in the photos,"Stayed three nights in a one bedroom suite. First time at this hotel, normally stay at Hilton Tower Bridge but this is my new favourite Hotel in London.

Beautiful reception area, wonderful staff at check-in. The first suite I was allocated was rather dark but they quickly found me another with larger windows and lots more light. Thank you!

Suite was really nice but lighting rather poor - only one lighting circuit in each part of the suite therefore it was case of all lights on or all lights off.

Fantastic bed, very comfortable.  Bathroom superb, great big shower.

Buffet breakfast was excellent and the bar and restaurant are really nicely decorated and very nice for just sitting and chilling.

Didn't use the pool or gym but they certainly looked impressive. 

One minor complaint is the Executive Lounge - service  in the evening was poor even when it was not busy. Slow to top up snacks and drinks which proved quite frustrating. Hopefully this will be improved by the next time I visit.",5,2016,01,11
120,WOW,"What a great addition to Hilton in London.  From start to finish it could not have been better.  The Staff were so helpful and friendly and the hotel is very stylish indeed.

We also used the executive lounge which was also first class.

Well done to all a fantastic stay.",5,2016,01,11
120,Hotel clean and spacious but lacking a bit of professionalism,"Stayed with family between the 24th and the 30th December 2015. On arrival the receptionist wanted us to upgrade our room for £24.00 extra per night which we refused. Then they asked for a deposit of £50.00 per day which is either blocked on your credit card or you leave cash. When we booked our King Juinor suite it was specified on the confirmation that we will have a city view and a high floor, we only obtained a courtyard interior view and on the first floor. We has also reserved to be delivered extra towels every day, request not taken out. Every day I had to go reception to ask for extra towels and that we wer three people in the room. King junior suite problems with the shower on the first day, no pressure and shower head leaking. They only upgraded us on the second day to a one bed suite still without a view as was specified on the reservation. I insisted in asking the receptionist before we entered the room if there is a city view but she just avoided the question in saying that the room is better. In this room problems with the lamp on the desk did not fonction, curtain rack broken. When extra bed is turned out no place to pass between the mini bar and the bed.. In the executive lounge breakfast was okay. Staff friendly. Only cold snacks in the evening. Sofas already with stains on them. Christmas dinner in the restaurant, we thought that a special table would have been reserved as we paid in advance. We were surprised that we could chose a table that was available. We were presented again with a bill at the end of the meal? We just had to pay for the beverages.",3,2016,01,11
120,"Beautiful, luxurious hotel - 30 min walk from central London.","The hotel is really nicely presented with attractive, modern and stylish décor. The staff are very helpful and friendly - they take their position seriously and try hard to ensure you are satisfied. We were upgraded which was lovely and the soft drinks and snacks in the fridge were complimentary. The room was really nicely presented with a lovely bathroom, robe, slippers and toiletries etc. Disappointingly, the hairdryer is on an extremely short, spiraled cable and all plug sockets are low down so trying to dry your hair means the plug keeps coming out of the wall. There is also no vanity mirror or area for use whilst drying hair/applying make up. The only mirrors are in the bathroom and there are no non-bathroom plug sockets (which is obviously key to safety but doesn't allow for styling hair in mirror whilst drying). There were no cotton buds or cotton pads which I feel are standard and means you don't need to pack your own. Plus the only time I've ever needed a sewing kit and non available in the room. I had picked this hotel due to the swimming pool facility, however, the morning I went for a swim, I was told the pool was not for use. I was very disappointed and not given any real answer as to why that was the case.",4,2016,01,11
120,Excellent value for money!,"Came to London for a site seeing weekend and had a lovely stay for 2 nights at the Hilton Bankside. We decided to walk every where,and  it was 20 minute walk to the London Eye and 30 minutes to the west end. 

The hotel had very friendly and helpful staff that made us feel very welcome. It was very clean and had great facilities such as the restaurant and bar.

The room was nicely decorated with a king size bed which was very comfortable! 

Would return to this hotel!

",5,2016,01,10
120,Hilton Bankside,"I stayed at this hotel for business and it's probably the best hotel I've stayed at for some time.  The facilities are excellent and nothing is too much trouble for the superb staff team.  It's only walking distance from transport links, such as Southwark, Waterloo and Blackfriars. I stayed four nights and have already booked to stay again.",5,2016,01,10
120,Wonderful experience!,"We were very impressed with this hotel. It is brand new, clean, spacious and beautiful. The location, near the Tate Modern and the Thames, is perfect. The swimming pool is amazing. What we were most impressed by was the excellent level of customer service. Everyone was very polite, friendly and helpful. The breakfast is incredible with nice chefs who will cook you fantastic pancakes and waffles!  In the evening, we had a drink in the bar which has such a lovely ambiance. We must give special thanks to the barman, Cipriani, who was so friendly and lovely to us. Perfect stay :)",5,2016,01,10
120,"An excellent choice for London, good value for money.","I am a 5 star traveler. This hotel is excellent for the following reasons:

Stuff is their best asset. Really friendly, ready to help you with anything, polite, smiling. 
I was really impressed and congratulations to how they make their visitors feel. 

Location is great. 

I stayed on December on Christmas time and the hotel had organized a couple of things that were really good moves. A chestnuts bench outside the hotel, some choirs singing Christmas songs in the lobby and nice gift on our door with fruits and chocolates when we woke up are some of them. 

Hotel is quiet.

Both rooms and public places are really really clean. 

Mattresses and cushions extremely comfortable. 

The Executive lounge is a nice place to relax, read your book or have a conversation. coffee, water, finger food were good as well. 

Breakfast is rich on products. We loved seeing the cook preparing our omelet and the huge variety of products to chose from. A very good experience overall. 

We tried the restaurant one night and we were so much satisfied that we went for a second night as well. 

Room service was good. 

Add on all this a very good price that was offered for the suit. They said something about upgrading our room but I did not see any difference based on what we have booked plus they gave as compliment the breakfast.

From the negative side, don't expect any view... At all! Our suite (on the second floor) was looking directly to some offices. We had the drapes closed all the time.

We did not try the pool. 

All in all this is a great choice to stay in London and I strongly suggest it.",5,2016,01,09
120,Great Location,the Hotel is just seconds from the RV1 bus that takes you to Tower bridge or covert gardens a few minutes walk to Bough Market and Southwark Cathedral Close to some great restaurants   Southbank is right across the road so you can walk to HMS Belfast or the London Eye if you want a good walk.,5,2016,01,09
120,Excellent,"Lovely brand new hotel, staff are excellent and everything looks great. Only gripe was that the hot water in the shower changed constantly between just a bit too hot and a little too cold. Other than that, would stay again.",5,2016,01,09
120,'Comfortable',"We enjoyed our stay here having a belated New Years celebration with friends. 
A warm welcome from the staff made us feel at home as soon as we arrived. The rooms are larger than you would expect from the location having stayed at other hotel chains in the same area. Loved the bathroom with a large shower and nice toiletries to boot. 

One downside and my wife's gripe was that there was nowhere to plug in the hairdryer near a mirror. She ended up sitting on the floor by the wardrobe to dry her hair, we passed this into the reception when we left.

Great bar area serving nice cocktails and drinks in a modern setting. We will certainly come here again.",4,2016,01,08
120,My new favorite place in London !!!,"Our family just had 3 rooms for 3 nights at this hotel during the Christmas holiday and I could not be happier. 
The fresh atmosphere, their rooms, friendly service for the price they charge is surely one of the best options in London. 
I am a Hilton Gold member, stayed earlier this year at the Conrad London and everything at this hotel pleased me better (except the location). 
I often travel to London and the Hilton Bankside will be certainly one of my top choices in the future.",5,2016,01,06
120,"Fantastic hotel, amazing staff, convenient location","I was very excited about our stay at Hilton Bankside, since I like the area and I knew the hotel was new. I was not disappointed! The design of the hotel really pleases my eye, and from the first moment on every member of staff we encountered was very friendly and welcoming. We felt well looked after. 

I also liked the room: the bed was very comfortable and you could not hear any traffic noise from outside in the room. Result? Nights very well slept! 

The pool is bigger than I have usually seen at hotels, although I was slightly disappointed with the jacuzzi, since it was in conjunction with the pool, and hence had the same cool water temperature as the pool. Didn't feel like a jacuzzi where you can relax for 10 minutes. 

I find the location of the hotel very convenient - the area itself is fairly quiet and not at all crowded with tourists, however the Blackfriars train station with trains to Gatwick airport is just 5-7 -minute walk away, and the Southwark tube station also within 5-minute walking distance, with Jubilee line service to Westminster, Green Park, Bond street etc. Tate Modern is just moments away, as is the Bankside - once you are by the Thames, it is easy to walk up and down to see many of London's landmarks such as the London Eye and Houses of Parliament, or cross the Millennium bridge to get to the City.",5,2016,01,06
120,Super New Hotel,"Really enjoyed our stay here, excellent Hilton with an modern urban feel, great well stocked large bar and yummy restaurant. Nice to have a pool as well.   Just a short walk to the tube - Jubilee line and Tate",4,2016,01,06
120,A new year's day weekend,"Great quality public areas - bars, restaurant and lobby all have great understated character even though the place is brand new - opened less than six months ago. The staff are from very diverse backgrounds all over the world and are all friendly and knowledgeable.",5,2016,01,05
120,lovely weekend stay,everything was perfect and in the right place.the fact that it is a fairly new hotel makes it even made me more comfortable everything was new and pristine the surrounds and hotel decor were modern and great. Didn't try the food or breakfast cos were were out and about most days.,5,2016,01,05
120,Amazing stay with the best hospitality!,"A party of 6 of us stayed at the Hilton Bankside for the New Year celebrations for 2 nights. 

From the time we checked in to the the time we checked out, the whole experience in every way was amazing! The ambience, the food, the staff and I could go on and on were EXCELLENT! Certainly a place we would go back to and recommend friends and family.",5,2016,01,05
120,Definitely stay here again!!,"This Hilton has surpassed our expectations especially with the help of concierge Anastasia Engelhardt.  She's wonderful and I couldn't compliment enough about her.  She's always wiling to help, made numerous recommendations and reservations that suited to our family's needs perfectly.  Best of all, she did it with a smile and a positive attitude.  This is our second trip to London (we stayed at the Royal horse guard last time) but she tipped the scale.  The location is convenient to major tourist spot and close proximity to several convenience stores and Starbucks.  We will definitely stay at this hotel on our next visit.",5,2016,01,05
120,"Great location, great rooms but perfumed air in lobby","Bankside was superbly located and the newness of the property insured the latest in room and bathroom hardware; overall very attractive.  ONLY 3 problems prevented a 5-Star rating: 1. I once stayed at the Bellagio in LV where they pump a perfume into the lobby air, however it is a natural smell not unlike fresh lilies, however @ Bankside the smell was like a cheap perfume  with a raspy musky overtone.  I am not allergic to such things however I can imagine it would be a problem for some. The smell was VERY noticeable, not subtle and overall is NOT a good idea. The smell was not refined or even close to a high-end perfume and Hilton would be well served to figure out what the Bellagio uses to create the fresh, after rainfall, ozone like, floral perfume that seems so natural. 2. They could  not provide access to our room until 3pm 3. At check-in, they tried very hard to sell us a room upgrade. The usual: would you like an upgrade but never mentioning the price until we asked. NOT COOL.",4,2016,01,05
120,Best new year ever!!!,"We stayed at The Hilton Bankside on New Year's Eve. The hotel was clean, airy & well decorated. The reception staff were friendly, efficient & extremely polite. Our room was a king executive  suite, which was tastefully decorated, the bed was so comfy. The free bar was a lovely bonus! 
The executive lounge was again tastefully decorated, the staff were topping our glasses up & making us feel very special. After the New Year's Eve fireworks we joined the partying in the  bar area. Lots of fun. 
Breakfast was good quality & again we couldn't praise how excellent all the staff were. Defiantly one of the best hotels we have ever stayed at. We will defiantly be coming back soon. ",5,2016,01,04
120,Best Hilton ever,"I stay in different Hiltons every week of  every year. This was my first stay at Bankside. It's a Hilton boutique style hotel which is First Class in every respect. The staff every single one were excellent and absolute lined up as a team and brilliant brand advocates.

The cocktail bar team were the best I have experienced in London, very knowledgeable and engaging. 

The wider Hilton group should visit and learn. 

Overall a fantastic experience - I will be back 

Well 
done !!",5,2016,01,04
120,Great new Hilton,"Stayed as the location was near to a conference I was attending. The hotel had only been open for a  few weeks so everything was spanking new  - you could almost smell the paint. I had an opening offer of an exec room which was very spacious with a great walk in shower. Only fault I could find was finding a mirror near to the hair dryer. Staff are very professional but still friendly, and the buffet breakfast was very comprehensive. I'll be back!",5,2016,01,04
120,very comfortable and stunning but let down,"there is no doubt that the hotel is very comfortable and convenient being in a quiet side street a few minutes walk from Tate Modern, Shakespeares Globe and Blackfriars Bridge. We commented on the very friendly reception we received especially from Andrei and the breakfast is amazing, however this was all let down by one silly little avoidable incident. After a long day of trduging around in appalling weather sightseeing we returned to the hotel at 4pm wanting only to have a shower and relax before going out in the evening, but the room had not been touched since we left it at 9am. Why can't they organise for the rooms of guests who are staying more than one night to be serviced first, before the rooms allocated to those who have not yet checked in. This is where the reception staff, who were so friendly the day before, turned into ""robot mode"" and stony faced started quoting policies and conditions at us. The staff refused to acknowledge that it was reasonable to expect one's room to have been serviced by 4pm. During the 30 minutes we had to sit in reception whilst our room was being cleaned we were able to more closely observe the antics of the staff and it became very clear that they were very friendly to the face of guests who had no problems, they were very disrespectful once the guest had moved away. I wouldn't have seen this if I had not had to sit around waiting for my room to be cleaned. It is this one incident which prevents me from given an Excellent rating and there is so much choice in the area that it would prevent me from choosing it again.",3,2016,01,04
120,Lovely New Find - Hilton Bankside,"When we arrived at 15:45 I was not pleased to hear that our room was not ready as check in is at 15:00 and I already checked in for that time online as a HH member. Otherwise, all was fairly nice. One huge mistake in the otherwise thoughtful modern design of the rooms is that there are no mirrors anywhere near electrical outlets. ( If you have to ask why then this does not apply to you so no worries) I requested a desk mirror and it was delivered promptly. The rooms are clean. The breakfast buffet has quite a nice selection. The pool area could do with some ambiance but it was clean and the seating was comfortable. The staff were friendly and helpful. I will say that this hotel has a few small kinks to iron out as they are meant to be a luxury hotel which is why they received 4 rather than 5.",4,2016,01,03
120,"New hotel, exceptional service","I stayed in a King Deluxe room on New Year's Eve, which was spacious, clean and comfortable. The bedding was superb and it really helped me get a good night's sleep. The complimentary bar was a nice touch. There is no view from the room but I didn't expect one. In the morning, I made use of the mini gym and swimming pool, which was lovely after a night of celebrations. Afterwards, I spent the afternoon in the Lounge, which was a relaxing place to sip endless lattes and do a bit of work. The staff in the Lounge were friendly and attentive. Also, a special thank you to front desk receptionist, Kiana Cho, for welcoming me and making my stay so exceptional. Keep up the good work.",5,2016,01,03
120,Such a shame,"We arrived on December 16th in the evening. We were checked in by a lovely gentleman who showed us up to the room and showed us pretty much every amenity in the room. Shortly after he left the room, we realised the rooms lights had been wired up wrong and you couldn't turn on the bathroom light from the appropriate switches, which was annoying. 

We'd booked the hotel to go and see Star Wars: The Force Awakens at the IMAX. We were seeing the 3am showing on opening night, and had specifically booked this hotel as it was close, and within decent walking distance to the cinema. We'd actually told all the staff we had spoken to that we were seeing the film, and they seemed quite excited.

We left around 2:20am and arrived back at the hotel around 6:45am, and settled down to sleep around 7am. Then, at about 9am this loud banging starts above our room. My boyfriend goes down to reception to find out what's going on, only to be told that there was nothing that could be done about the noise. We then asked to be moved rooms, we were told there were no other rooms available, I didn't believe this and asked to speak to the duty manager in charge. He came out to tell us he would move us to another room in the next hour. We finally get moved into the other room at 4:45pm!! (Nearly seven hours after being told it would be an hour!!) I had to leave to meet my partners sister in Bank, so didn't have a spare key to the room. 

I got my partner to text me the room we'd been moved to and was told by the woman on the desk ""your boyfriend is in the old room, the room isn't ready yet..."" after he had just told me he was in the new room, I told her this and she went to the staff room in the back - she came back with an annoyed look on her face (like she'd been told off by someone) swiped a new key card through... But gave me the wrong room number... Luckily, I had the number otherwise I'd have walked into someone else's room!! My partner came and got the door for me. Another manager came up to apologise for everything that had happened. They took off the charge for the first night, and gave us lounge access. We were promised that the noise wouldn't be on this side of the building. We looked around the new room, we found used, dirty sanitary towels in the bin in the toilet, there was a razor box in the bedroom and a load of bags stuffed in the bin. I did mention this to reception, but nothing came of it. We visited the lounge which was very nice. At this point we stayed up till about 9pm (no point in sleeping then) - then surprise surprise the noise started early in the morning again. Luckily, we'd well and truly slept, but at that point we packed up and left the hotel. We want to come back and do hope for a better stay in the future, as the majority of the staff were lovely, and the hotel is gorgeous. It was such a shame.",3,2016,01,03
120,"Great bar, brilliant hotel","We have just had a fantastic few days staying at the Hilton Bankside, it's only been open a few months and I think is one of the best hotels I have stayed in in London. The staff are especially friendly and helpful with a special note to all the brilliant bar tenders, Ricky, Manon, Matteo and Laurentio who made my wife birthday celebration even more memorable. I highly recommend this hotel",5,2016,01,03
120,Excellent!,"What a great hotel, sadly just for one night. As others have mentioned, nothing is too much trouble for anyone working there and all the staff seemed to be friendly and smiling. The gym is well equipped and breakfast has almost everything (and if they don't have it, remember nothing is too much trouble!). Lastly I would have to note that the room service we ordered was some of the nicest I've ever had, and I wouldn't normally say that unless it was exceptional! Would definitely stay again.",5,2016,01,03
120,Dreadful experience,"We arrived and had previously asked for interconnecting rooms for us and our son I even phoned the previous day to confirm and they told us yes we had interconnecting rooms. We arrived and checked in and went up to our rooms and the were three doors apart and on the opposite side of the corridor from each other so complained at reception to some bewildered receptionist who could barely speak English . The ex lounge was a waste of time with very few stale nibbles and few drinks , we had a very average evening meal which was very over priced then went to bed in a room that looked twenty years old not months with stained carpets etc , we checked out at 6 am without breakfast and were to,d we couldn't even have a cup of tea as nothing was set up 😢 The next day we received an email and they'd charged us twice for the rooms . Disgusting Hilton get your act together .",2,2016,01,02
120,Service makes the hotel,"Great service throughout from check-in, breakfast and the bar. Professional, friendly and efficient. We enjoyed a great stay, beautiful large room with very comfortable bed. Nice touch from hotel with birthday cake. Location in quieter location of London but still close to Waterloo station and we walked 25 min into Covent gardens. Recommend",5,2016,01,02
120,Best New Years Eve ever !,"Just returned from a most wonderful stay at the Hilton Bankside Hotel which was by all accounts magnificent in every way.
Right from the greeting from Per on reception, the excellent Anthony later on, the Staff and overall service is excellent.
The Junior Suite was spotless, and had everything one would ask for, and the executive lounge was worth every penny.
The convenience of the Tate Modern and St Pauls is also noted as was the short walk to Blackfriars Bridge and the Fireworks spectacle. Well done Hilton, this particular Hotel must be the shining example in the chain. Happy New year and keep up the great work,",5,2016,01,01
120,Nye in London,"Lovely hotel, very comfortable beds and nice a quiet. T.v in room is really good plenty of choice, massive shower head in bathroom. Getting around London was easy with taxi apps.plenty of information in the room about the hotel and facilities. Would of preferred big brand tea bags in room bit really can't complain. There's 2 local supermarkets on the same street as the hotel including a coffee shop.  ",5,2016,01,01
120,"Great hotel, excellent staff.","Stayed for 2 nights with my family in a king suite, fabulous room in a great hotel in a good location in easy walking distance to the Tate, south bank & Southwark tube station. 5 mins around the corner is also a bus stop that will take you straight into the west end in about 5 minutes. Pretty much ticks all the boxes for me, though the complimentary mini bar sealed the deal :)

The service from the staff was second to none, I've stayed in a fair few hiltons up & down the country and the staff here are amongst the best I've come across.
",5,2015,12,31
120,Perfect,"Greeted at door with offers to help with suitcase twice - this level of personal service is difficult to find these days.  Was able to check in early with a room upgrade and offer of full buffet breakfast as two benefits of being a Gold member.  Nice to see this level of recognition.  The guy on check in was very friendly and chatty - asking about our stay then leaving his desk to give direction to the lifts. 
Room on sixth floor (614) with a partial view of St Pauls Cathedral.  Room was beautifully furnished with a free soft drinks bar which was replenished whilst out to dinner as well as a turn down service,
Breakfast until 11 am was really helpful as it was a late night - again friendly service and good traditional Hilton buffet.  Check out was efficient and friendly.
Highly recommended - would definitely return.",5,2015,12,31
120,Treat yourself in the heart of London,"I stayed overnight in Hilton Bankside with my partner, friends and family on the occasion of my 40th birthday party. I couldn't ask for a better treat! We had a fantastic party in one of the rooms next to the ballroom downstairs. The food and drinks were great - the steak I've been served was to die for and my drinks had a generous amount of ingredients :)
Staff has been very helpful and discreet. We simply had a fabulous evening.
For the night we were staying in one of the hotel suites - spacious bathroom, very comfortable bed and modern interiors. I loved it.  Should you stay in this hotel you will notice that management took a really good care of every detail and rooms are finished to a very high standard. 
I also recommend having a breakfast there - you'll be spoiled for choice of pastry, bread, hot food, different meats, fish, tea and coffee...anything you like. 
Fantastic interiors and lovely staff will make anyone day on a special occasion. Higly recommended.",5,2015,12,31
120,Hilton Bankside London trip,this is a fine hotel with a great staff. Close to several tube stops. Good taxi service. Walking distance to the Shard and the Thames. Approx 20 min walk to Covent Garden. The room we had on the 3rd floor was quiet and quite large for London. We were very happy here and would go back.,5,2015,12,31
120,Wonderful stay in the heart of London,"This very new and modern Hilton hotel is well located in the heart of Central London; it is easily reached via either one of these Underground stops - Southwark, Waterloo and London Bridge. My sister and I stayed in a twin room, which was furnished with extremely comfortable beds, a good shower and all the necessary amenities, despite the view being that of a wall. Its surrounding area are filled with supermarkets, bars, cafes, restaurants and shops. Highly recommended and it is definitely ones of best hotels in the Hilton chain I've stayed in.",4,2015,12,30
120,Amazing hotel,"Stayed in this hotel with my fiancé as an engagement treat on Tuesday 29th December and it was brilliant. Brand new and well designed with outstanding service! Room was great and very comfortable with great shower and plenty of complimentary treats.
Would 100% recommend and we will be back.",5,2015,12,30
120,3.5 rating,"The Hilton London Bankside was pretty good. the room was spacious and the bed was super comfortable, but no real place to unpack and our room faced a brick wall on the 7th floor. Breakfast was delicious and worth the extra money since it wasn't included. A close walk to the tube, the Tate modern and other attractions. I would stay here again next time I'm in London. ",4,2015,12,30
120,Great cossy atmosphere,"In London, nearby the centre. Lovely and friendly staff. Clean rooms with all the comfort you need including airco and refridgerator. Nice swimmingpool and last but not least: great breakfast. I hope I'll get  back some day...",5,2015,12,30
120,Best Bartenders in London,"Most of the staff in the Hotel are nice, but some of them at reception were not kind enough for the quality a Hilton Hotel is known.
What I liked most was the bartenders from the bar (Ricky and Matteo). Really nice, funny and very professionals.",3,2015,12,29
120,Perfect Birthday Stay,"My partner and I arrived at London Hilton Bankside on Sunday 27th December 2015 for my birthday. As soon as we pulled up to the hotel we were instantly impressed. The outside of the hotel is beautiful. The concierge met us and took our cases from us straight away. 

We then went into the reception area, what can I say.....the Christmas decorations were great and the atmosphere of the place was fantastic. The decor was beautiful, clean and modern, with a touch of luxury. What more could we want! We went up to our room and it was stunning; the nicest bed and shower I have ever seen in a hotel. 

In the evening a birthday cheesecake was delivered to our door, which was so nice, and a 'turn-down' service is give. Our bed sheets were rearranged, as well as slippers put on the floor for us - again a real luxury.

We went for drinks at 'The Distillery' bar which is a great place to go.

The hotel staff throughout were friendly, polite and couldn't offer you any more assistance; I haven't stayed at a hotel like this before I don't think - a perfect compliment. My partner and I both agreed that it is the best hotel we have ever stayed at; and we regularly travel and stay in London. 

Perfect hotel - and we cannot wait to go back!!",5,2015,12,28
120,Great birthday weekend!!,"It was my girlfriends birthday over the period of our stay and instantly when mentioning we were upgraded free of charge to a deluxe room with free drinks and refreshments. Most of the local area was closed as it was after the Christmas period but we enjoyed what we paid for by relaxing in the hotel and mostly ordered takeaways, enjoyed drinks at the bar and swam in the pool. Very refreshing and the staff were lovely, every member of staff signed a birthday card and a manager personally came to our room and gave it to us with a birthday cake. I have stayed with the Hilton hotels a lot with business and this was the first time as a paying customer and again they went over and above to deliver excellent service. I will always stay with the Hilton when available wherever I go as I know I will always be looked after. HIGHLY RECOMMEND IT!!",5,2015,12,27
120,"Great hotel, great location","Stayed with sisters for a celebration weekend in December. Reservation staff were very helpful and ensured we had an inter-connecting room and also added access to Executive Lounge as a treat.

Rooms very comfortable and very clean. Beds very comfy. My room was missing a hairdryer so ask at reception  Wifi access was good.

All staff were really helpful and friendly. Kept an eye on you without being obtrusive.

Hotel bar was very cosy and had amazing gin selection.

Location great - just behind Tate Modern. Easy walk to Borough Market, Globe, Southwark, Southbank.

Would have given 5 stars but there are some little teething troubles. We never got a teaspoon with our hot drinks in bar or restaurant. I paid for my rooms upfront and got an inexperienced staff member so some confusion ensued. No hairdryer in room. Little things, easily sorted. Would definitely go back as the atmospehere and service was great and the rooms lovely.",4,2015,12,23
120,Family Christmas break,The hotel is really lovely and the effort made with the festive decorations is superb. All the staff were helpful the rooms were great and the breakfast is the best displayed we have ever encountered in a Hilton. The exec lounge is a good size with lovely decor the food on offer was very minimal but that's the only negative!,5,2015,12,22
120,"Staff great, veggie foot awful","Nice, modern, friendly - the staff especially. The food however is terrible, roast potatoes that are raw inside and the less said about the vegetarian option then better - in the day time pop around the corner to Frank's for a jacket and cheese.

The service is fantastic, but really let down by terrible kitchen - it can only improve.",2,2015,12,21
120,"Avoid Hilton Bankside, the Premier Inn or Mecure Hotel are a couple of steps away - Stay there instead","Treated like a common criminal at check in by the Guest Relations Manager and check in staff.

Hilton Bankside could not find my reservation, despite me making one through Hotelopia and therefore, the Guest Relations Manger wanted to charge me for a room again which was £180, despite the fact I had already having paid for a room.

Since logging a complaint with Hilton Bankside the Room Director at Bankside has emailed me with this excuse ""Yours is a very rare incident as Hotelopia sent your booking to an incorrect email address therefore we were unable to trace your reservation"". 

At check in I provided proof of the Hotelopia charge to my bank card and Hotelopia reservation (but no reservation number) but this was not good enough for the Guest Relations Manger, who said ""this doesn't prove you have a reservation"". She would not deviate from the Hilton Hotel processes and procedures. She wanted to charge me for a room again, and then sort the fiasco in the morning with Hotelopia. i.e. call Hotelopia to see if my booking was genuine. Hence, why I felt as though I was being treated like a criminal. My view is why charge me for the room? Why not check me in and then check with Hotelopia in the morning and then if I were lying, charge me for the room. It was too late at 8:00pm in the evening to call Hoptelopia as their call centre was closed.

I raised a complaint with the Room Director at Bankside and the email communications I had dismissed my complaint - the Room Director despite not being present that evening in the conversations has a very different version of events. Her version goes something like this - the Guest Relations Manager only wanted to place a hold on my credit card for incidentals. However, I completely disagree I've stayed at enough hotels to know the difference between being charged £180 for a hotel room and a £50 hold being placed on my card for incidentals which is released on checkout. 

Despite the Room Director informing me the hotelopia room charge would be refunded after 3 weeks of no refund I had to chase Hotelopia myself - they couldn't have been more helpful and apologetic.

The staff at Hilton Bankside are nicey nicey, smily smily as soon as you walk in and all over you, this doesn't last long though - they soon close ranks. 

The Premier Inn or Mecure Hotel are a couple of steps away from the Hilton Bankside and are much better options than the Hilton Bankside, three words for the Hilton Bankside - avoid, avoid, avoid!!!",1,2015,12,21
120,Christmas break,"Great location to reach the South Bank and access to London by tube. Great rooms spacious with all you need. Be careful as the bar prices are shown in pence and at a glance you can mistake pricing easily. Almost bought a £55 G&T but thankfully the barman questioned my choice. Quiet location with lots of places for breakfast nearby. Don't be swayed by the hefty price for breakfast at the hotel. 
 ",4,2015,12,20
120,Excellent luxury hotel,"The hotel staff was very eager to help. The room had a boring view of a brick wall, but was very nice inside. The pool facility was a very nice way to start the morning, before the fantastic hotel brunch. Both the gin-bar and grill restaurant were very nice.",5,2015,12,20
120,Truly exceptional!,"I visited the hotel last night with group of friends. We started from drinks in The Destillery bar, which has got extraordinary collection of gins. Riccardo the Head Bartender created truly amazing cocktails for us. He explained in detail the origin of the ingredients and the inspiration behind the cocktails. I must say the cocktails were one the best I've ever had. Afterwards we moved to the restaurant where we had 3 course dinner. Marius who looked after us provided us with exeptional service. Beautifully executed food was exquisite and sublime prepared to perfection from starter to dessert. What makes this impressive hotel stands out from the crowd apart of course from well designed, pleasing interiors is the staff who is discreet, profesional, consize and makes you feel very special.",5,2015,12,19
120,Hooray for Hilton,"Exceptionally good hotel close to Borough Market and Thames South bank. All the usual bits you would expect from Hilton including fabulous beds, black out curtains, fluffy robes and fantastic bathroom. Brilliant staff, great bar. Good price includes pool and gym too which we didn't use.",5,2015,12,19
120,Genuinely THE best city hotel I've stayed in so far,"As a Gold Honors member, we tend to stay at a Hilton when we travel, so we figured we would crash here for the night as we were having dinner and drinks at the nearby Oxo Tower with close friends for a Christmas gathering

The check in was easy and smooth and the guest relations manager quite simply made us feel so welcome it automatically relaxed us after a long working day

The room itself was extremely spacious (which surprised me for a city hotel) and the decor was modern but relaxed
The bathroom mirror is so awesome, I want one!!

Breakfast was another surprise
The staff in this hotel are clearly well trained as they make a big effort to ensure you are OK
From the welcome at the entrance to the restaurant to the waiting staff and the chefs - extremely impressed 

Food itself was also spot on - wide choice from their buffet, but it's how the food is presented and laid out is what I liked
And the decor of the restaurant was relaxing and quirky enough to grab attention, particularly the mounted animal heads made from recycled paper (look better than it sounds - trust me)

Would happily stay here again",5,2015,12,19
120,Great spot for a weekend break,"Travelled here for only a day & night recently and it was perfect and exactly what we wanted! If you fly to Gatwick, you can get the train direct to a nearby stop and the hotel is a 2 minute walk away. 
After that when you get in the place is very clean, very neat and looks really nice. The staff were very friendly and the rooms were fantastic! Really open spaced and tidy. Not a fantastic view but still...
The location was great you can walk out the door and you are pretty much on the Thames and can stroll up and down it and try to various restaurants, coffee shops and even the Tate Modern. It is a great spot and really accessible for a weekend break.",5,2015,12,17
120,Best Hilton I have been in in over 5 years!,"Dear Hilton, if you read these reviews I recommend you send all your staff and managers in London to this Hilton to see how a hotel should be run!

Absolutely perfect experience from the minute I walked in the front door to the minute I left, the staff are excellent, the standard and quality of the rooms, corridors, lifts and restaurants are first class. The beds are awesome and so comfy 

I cannot fault anything about this hotel and it has restored my faith in Hilton as so many of their hotels are looking really tired",5,2015,12,16
120,Great new hotel between Southwark and Borough,"Excellent hotel with the best staff and service I have received in London for years. Bar is lively and the restaurant looks good, however I haven't tried it yet. Good position within walking distance (10 mins) of Borough Market and Southwark tube.",5,2015,12,16
120,Excellent new Hilton,"I stayed in the Hilton Bankside for one night last week. I had one of the King rooms with access to the executive lounge. Very central convenient location for access to the City and there are local Tesco / Sainsburys stores within two minutes of the hotel if required.  Complimentary soft drink/snacks the in mini bar. Had room service and the burger was very good. 
Two minor gripes were that the view from the room was limited and the telephone did not work.  
    ",4,2015,12,14
120,Dinner Date,"Once we had found somewhere to park we finally reached the hotel which was very nice indeed. We went straight to the restaurant  (as only dinned here), and was seated at our table. We ordered from the set menu and was given a glass of bubbly each. As with most set menus there was not a great choice but what we did have was fantastic. Crab & Salmon croquet and the Potato truffle to start , followed buy the Sea Bass & Duck. To finish we had Cheesecake & chocolate slice with popcorn.Simply delicious.  Atmosphere, ambience and the service was all very good. We shall defiantly being going back and defiantly recommend eating or perhaps staying here too.",4,2015,12,13
120,Nothing special,"Bankside's marketing team have done a brilliant job of marketing this new hotel as something special. I believed the hype. Until I got there.  Went to one of four unmarked desks and was sent away as it was the Concierge desk. Joined a queue to check in; check in was unremarkable. The room had a brilliant view of a brick wall. Nothing more, just a brick wall. Mentioned on check-out and tweeted the hotel - no response. This hotel charges a premium - in my view it's not work it.",3,2015,12,13
120,Excellent Hilton ,"One of the best 5 star business hotels I've stayed in. Friendly staff, very friendly reception team, excellent food, brand new facilities, clean rooms, great location. I recommend the hotel to any business or leisure traveler and definitely will go there again.",5,2015,12,13
120,Well located and comfortable hotel,"I stayed here mid week on a business trip and was pleasantly surprised as this was not a standard Hilton. It reminded me a bit of the Hilton Vienna Plaza (previously reviewed), small, friendly clean lines with well thought out room design and spacious bathroom. Staff were accessible and friendly. In the room all the space is used- just on the left of the entry there is a wall panel which discreetly opens to reveal the iron, board and safe. 
Bed comfort was good curtains were thick and kept out any light from the street.
The area is really convenient for the Globe, Tate, Shard and St Pauls.
 My only complaint was the breakfast where there was a standard buffet rate for a continental (18UKP) but really nothing on the a la carte menu for those who just wanted cereal and toast. The only appealing continental option available was a mix of berries and yoghurt. I suggest that Hilton looks at providing those who  want a minimal breakfast with some simple options. For value I score the hotel as 3.5 due to the above",4,2015,12,11
120,Great addition to Hilton's London portfolio,"Quietly situated in the now thriving and eclectic Southbank, 3 minutes walk from the Tate modern, this new Hilton is a very good hotel.

The industrial nature of the area has been maintained in the hotel design, which adds to it's charm.

The rooms are extremely comfortable and unusually decorated using natural wood etc. lack of plugs close to mirrors (or vice versa) is a bad design flaw though as is the lack of USB ports in rooms (strange for a new hotel).

The executive lounge is large and comfortable.

The breakfast restaurant is large and spacious and the food selection although typically Hilton seemed greater and better presented than usual

The Bar is well lit and provides a great place to relax though drinks aren't cheap.

The gym facilities and pool add to the attraction of the hotel

Overall the staff are the greatest asset of the Hilton Bankside - whether the check-in guys, the exec lounge hosts, the bar staff etc - all were excellent........

Great restaurants in the area (eg Hixter), lots to do, Tesco Metro and M&S food close by. This area retains a completely different feel to the west End - again this adds to the appeal.

Will definitely stay here again",4,2015,12,11
120,"Absolutely amazing stay, thanks for looking after us!","Stayed here for 2 nights with my mum over the weekend. The hotel was fantastic, really lovely room especially the bathroom with huge walk in shower. The toiletries they have there are also really nice. Used the gym both mornings and all the facilities were top notch! Also had a swim in the pool/jacuzzi and was really relaxing! Nice big fluffy towels, bottles of water, fruit, magazines - perfect! Breakfast was to die for, best I have ever had in any hotel. The selection was incredible and everything was amazing quality. We also used the bar there which had a great atmosphere and would definitely go back here for a drink as I live in London.

The one thing though that made our stay so brilliant was the staff. Everyone was so friendly and helpful and nothing was too much trouble. Especially Neil at the concierge and his team, ensuring we were looked after from start to finish, providing recommendations for where to eat and giving a real 5 star service. When we got there he told us to grab some lunch at Table across the road and the food there was so delicious and all locally sourced (which my mum loved), so great start to the stay. All the waiters, receptionists, laundry maids etc. were so friendly, remembered you and made you feel really looked after and relaxed which is exactly what we needed. 

It's a great location for walks along the South Bank, either heading left towards the South Bank centre (we went to a concert at the Royal Festival Hall), a visit to the Tate Modern (2 mins walk from hotel) or right along the river towards Borough Market, The Globe, Southwark Castle, London Bridge and The Shard etc. Especially good in Winter at this time as all the christmas markets are in full swing. 

I would recommend the hotel to all my friends and family and hope to visit again soon, thanks for such a great time!!",5,2015,12,11
120,Fantastic stay in London!,"New hotel in a great location (very close to Tube stop or even a short walk to the  Millennium Bridge).  I absolutely loved the decor and design of the rooms, very modern and ultra-cool but also comfortable and practical.  The staff is probably one of the friendliest I've ever had the pleasure of dealing with in all of my travels.  They go out of their way to make sure your stay is enjoyable.  Well, thanks everyone.  It absolutely was!",5,2015,12,10
120,A very cosy and comfy option ,"I stayed here for the first time this week for three nights and would happily have not come home. 

The hotel feels exceptionally homely and I echo all the other adulations in the other reviews about the fantastic breakfast, the friendly omelette chef and for that matter all the staff at the hotel particularly Rachel at reception and the Italian cocktail barman! 

Rooms were pretty comfy. I had a view of a brick wall but it was one of the nicer brick walls I've look out at in London hotel rooms! Bathrooms were great l. Loved the stone floor in the shower area. Interesting there doesn't appear to be any baths in the bedrooms...fine by me but might be a dealbreaker to others 

We are in the restaurant one night and the wagu burger was great. 

The location isn't as handy to tube stations as others but if you like the walk it's only about a ten minute walk to either Blackfriars , St. Paul's and London Bridge. If you choose St. Paul's the walk across millennium bridge particularly at night is something else.

All in all I loved this hotel and would consider it again next time I'm in London ",5,2015,12,10
120,Great contemporary hotel ,Stayed here for 1 night and really impressed with the hotel and the staff . They moved and arranged a room for us for an early check in as we needed to get ready for a wedding and this was very much appreciated . The hotel is very modern and luxurious with very comfortable beds . We had a great stay and room service and breakfast in the morning was great . We will be staying here again for sure in the future . ,5,2015,12,09
120,55 Days Young,"I stayed here yesterday on a business trip to London. 
I've often stayed at the Premier Inn over the road but this hotel is a much classier operation altogether.
It has been open for precisely 55 days (as one of the staff proudly told me) so it's all bright eyed and bushy tailed. 
There's plenty of staff and all of them seem very excited to work here and are trying super hard to impress (which they did).
The public areas are all large and well thought out, modern and reassuringly comfortable - somehow pulling off being cozy on a big scale.
My room had a huge comfy bed, a chaise, large desk area, great bathroom and a mini bar with complimentary treats.
The breakfast restaurant was enormous and the choice impressive - I'd be interested to see how the chef coped with the bespoke egg orders at the busiest times though! 
All in all a really impressive set up and I look forward to coming back.",5,2015,12,09
120,Not as we expected.,"Stayed for 3 nights, really not impressed
rooms are ok but only had english teabags the first day, never restocked although milk and sugar was
had dinner first night in the restaurant, the fumes and smoke from the kitchen area were terrible, really ruined the experience as it was an important meeting with family.
Next morning fire alarm went off and we were evacuated for a few minutes, strange that it didnt happen the night before when it was obvious
Really disapointing  breakfast, ordered eggs benedict, was really cold
scrambled eggs had a terrible texture like minced and grainy, bacon was also cold and hard
overall not a great experience for the price",2,2015,12,09
120,I would use this hotel again and again and again,"very comfortable reception staff extremely welcoming reception was beautifully decorated as it is December room upgraded at no cost clean and new looking hotel very central hotel - 10 - 15 minute walk to the shard, London Bridge breakfast - wide array of choices",5,2015,12,09
120,Stunning brand new hotel!,"What a surprise for a Hilton brand - this amazing new hotel is absolutely lovely. Brand spanking new, shining in every way, with a delightful staff of really happy, friendly and efficient hospitality professionals. Comfy room, super bed, gorgeous surroundings and a fabulous bar and restaurant with a great breakfast spread. Well worth a visit, and close to Southwalk tube station.",5,2015,12,08
120,Great,Just returned from a two night stay that we booked via lastminute.com and we absolutely loved it. The only issue with booking with lastminute.com is that you are only offered a room with twin beds and it is £45 extra to upgrade to a king-size bed. The location was for us was ideal as we walk everywhere it was a good base and there are some really nice bars and restaurants close by. Check in was quick and easy we declined the breakfast which was an extra £25 per person per day which seems silly when there is a café next door. The room was a fantastic size as was the bathroom and it really did feel like luxury! We would definitely stay here again especially if we got the same deal on last minute as it was a bargain!,5,2015,12,08
120,Excellent new Hilton,"Really enjoyed this Hilton property. Easy tube access via Southwark stop about 3-5 minutes away. One can walk too across a number of close bridges. Nice easy walk to Burroughs Market. The staff is excellent from front desk check-in, lobby help to the wonderful hard-working executive lounge staff (ohh..maybe more variety of eggs for breakfast in lounge). And praise to housekeeping. We stayed in nice Junior suite that was very spacious. One niggle in that room was the extra toilet room which was very tight with regard to toilet and not well placed. Also, need a towel for the sink in that room. Overall, an excellent property with very comfortable rooms and highly recommend.",5,2015,12,07
120,Top class hotel.,"Stayed here with my daughter for two nights this weekend. What a fantastic place! From the moment we arrived we were made to feel special and were really well looked after by all the staff. The concierge Neil gave us a great local recommendation for lunch which we wouldn't have found on our own. 
We loved the décor and the bar was a great place for a drink with friends in the evening. We also had a relaxing swim in the pool. The breakfast in the restaurant was amazing, with something to suit every possible taste.
It is also ideally situated for a visit to Tate Modern, the Southbank Centre and the fantastic sights of the Southbank.",5,2015,12,07
120,One of my best Hilton experiences - wonderful staff,"Stayed for weekend . A beautifully apponted hotel with extremely friendly and professional staff. From moment of arrival its was a joy. I am a HH Diamond member and was treated very well at check in with recognition upgrade ( I think ) and advice on dining option - in particular the amazing 50% off food at their OxBo restaurant. The room was very nicely appointed , a little bit dark however. Bathrooom was excellent - great spacious shower. The food at OxBo was amazing - great selection , very generous portions and very very tasty - the sdtaff were extremely attentitive and paerticularly helpful . I cannot fault this new Hilton - and wish them every success - I am staying again next weekend :) ! Lucky me .",5,2015,12,07
120,One Night,Excellent quality of service and accommodation if a little off the beaten track. The bed was uncommonly comfortable. The staff could not have been more helpful and attentive. It was a shame that I was only there for one night.,5,2015,12,07
120,First class !,"My husband and I came down to London this weekend for a ceremony that we were attending .
We had booked in to the London Hilton Bankside, we knew nothing about this hotel except that the location was perfect for our needs.
From the moment that we arrived we were treated like royalty.
The doorman opened the door for us , our bags were taken by a very polite attendant, our checkin at reception was very warm and welcoming.
We were shown to our room where the attendant explained the workings of the electrics etc , 
We had a beautifully decorated room and we were very surprised to find the fridge was stocked with various items for us to use at no charge ! 
I had booked a hair appointment locally and the desk staff drew where I needed to be on a map for me.
We came downstairs ready to meet our friends and the reception staff made a point of telling us how lovely we looked tonight ! 
The bar area was very welcoming and our drinks were served to us in beautiful glasses, we were also given mulled wine for the season by a lovely lady at the entrance to the bar.
On our return at 0130 in the morning , doors were opened for us , in our room our bed linen had been turned down , fresh towels had been placed in the bathroom , slippers placed by our bedside and a bottle of water on our bedside tables! What a wonderful service. We had a great nights sleep in a truly darkened room.
In the morning we were greeted again by staff asking us if we slept comfortably and wishing us a lovely day ahead.
Our breakfast was first class , the man making the fresh eggs in all kinds of ways was really pleasant , my only criticism was that I am vegetarian and when I asked if there were veggie sausages etc I was told there were none  ! 
Our checkout was smooth and professional, it was a delight to stay at this hotel , we would certainly return without doubt .
Hotel Bankside , be proud of your staff , they are a credit to your hotel !!!",5,2015,12,07
120,Fun to be in at brand new hotel,"This property really felt more like a boutique property than a traditional Hilton.  It is designed in a ""V"" shape which means that my room in the inside of the V was so totally quiet.  It was wonderful.  Rooms were very comfortable and it had a cool, modern bathroom.  My only complaint was that the bathroom must have been designed by a man in that there was no perch for your legs to shave in the shower.  Staff was terrific.  Wifi flawless.  It was a great location with several nice pubs, markets nearby.  Easy walk to the tube.  Very safe feel to the area.",4,2015,12,06
120,Treated like VIP's by EVERYONE!,"My partner and I are well travelled, both home and abroad as we spend every penny we earn on it. We have also worked for many years as Mystery Shoppers so have a natural talent for noticing service levels.
This hotel is right at the top, amongst the best of them.
As a hotel, the interior and facilities are pretty plush (for those people who regularly stay at Hilton hotels, it seemed to be quite a step up from the usual style). 
Choice and quality at breakfast could not be bettered by any other hotel we have stayed in.
But what really makes the difference (which is true for any area of the service industry) is the staff. We could not walk past any member of staff, from the housekeepers to the doormen to the waiters to reception staff or any body else without them interacting with us in the most genuine manner. They were all, without exception, warm, welcoming, funny, efficient and helpful. Never in the commen 'robotic' manner you so often come across, but genuine and interested in us as individuals, like we were part of their family.
We were in London for a weekend visit to 'see the sights' and returning to this hotel at the end of each day and receiving the various welcomes, became one of the highlights.
To make our top notch stay even better, when the receptionist discovered it was my birthday treat, she upgraded us to a better room that included a free, basic minibar each day, issued vouchers for a free drink each in the bar and arranged a small birthday cake to be delivered to our room when we returned at the end of our first day.
Would we return in the future? You bet your life!",5,2015,12,06
120,Wonderful luxurious beautiful place!,"This is an absolutely fantastic hotel! Just about as good as it gets in London. Newly opened, we got a great opening offer including breakfast and a welcome drink. All staff were very helpful, the room was suberb, the bathroom luxurious, the bed big and comfy and the decor very tasteful. A great spot in London too with so much going on. We had a wonderful break - thank you Hilton!",5,2015,12,06
120,Very good service from the staff,"Hotel generally was ok, the thing that impresed me most was staff service from the door man to the funny lady that was preparing pancakes for breakfast. I was feeling good and pampered during all my staying there. ",4,2015,12,05
120,5 Stat Hotel,"Hotel located middle of Central London, walking distance from tube station.   One of the best hotel I stayed in. very clean and modern, friendly staff and helpful. The quality of breakfast with excellent.  At a price of £250 per night, I expect this quality and service.",4,2015,12,05
120,Brilliant,"You always expect functional quality at a Hilton Hotel. But this brand new build (3 months open they said) is a beauty. 

Lovely reception, bar and restaurant and the rooms (at least ours 244) was fantastic. 

If I had to complain then I'd ask for a mirror in the suite area for my wife to do make up and hair. But that is the only issue I could offer. 

Well played Hilton. Refurbish the others to this standard please. ",4,2015,12,05
120,"One of the best hotels I've stayed in, especially in London. Service was awesome.","Checked in by Ashley. Very nice and helpful chap! In fact just about all staff were individually very polite, considerate and helpful. 

Room was large and clean, view less desirable but it's London, and perfectly quiet. I slept very well in a big comfy bed.

Bar and staff were great. Breakfast was fantastic and again the Hilton team were attentive and helpful all round.

Thoroughly recommended.",5,2015,12,03
120,Great hotel near city of London,"Spent a fantastic 3 nights here which we enjoyed thoroughly - extremely comfortable rooms and beds, outstanding breakfast, classy bar and nice pool and gym.  Staff helpful and keen to please - what more could you ask for? Oh and they have decent wifi free : )",5,2015,12,02
120,"Great hotel, service and location!","Nice clean and comfortable large room with great service and friendly staff. Excellent location with nice cafès, bars and shops just paces away, and the station connecting you to anywhere in London just 3 mins away.",4,2015,12,01
120,Luxury design hotel,"Stayed in an executive twin room with access to the lounge. The room was big and beds very comfortable. The breakfast buffe had many choices and the hot food was freshly prepared by the chef.
Staff was very friendly and welcoming. My only negative comment is that hilton hotels don't award and recognize their loyal customers. I am a gold member and never get an upgrade. I will definately come back though as this is my new favourite London hotel.",5,2015,12,01
120,A really wonderful hotel in Watreloo area,"The hotel service was excellent and you felt immediately taken care of and welcome. They helped me with my luggaged up to the room. And the room was really nice and modern, clean and quite large. Felt luxurious. The breakfast was absolutely wonderful! Can really recommend this!",5,2015,12,01
120,very nice hotel,Brand new hotel with plenty of amenities. Room kind of small and window facing another building's wall. Besides that excellent for price paid through British Airways as a package.  Location not the best in London but 3 blocks away from underground.,5,2015,12,01
120,Fantastic hotel,This is a fantastic new Hilton in a great location. The service is right up there with the likes of Ritz Carlton. Best of any Hilton I have stayed in. Rooms are done in a minimalist style with a great walk in raindrop shower. The executive lounge on the ground floor is particularly good with a great selection of food and drink and again magic service. Well done Hilton. Your best hotel in London. ,5,2015,12,01
120,Great service in the bar !,"I went to the bar last saturday, for the first time. It's a very nice place ! As I was on my own I sat at the bar, and a bartender welcome me and gave me the drink list. 
After few minutes, a young lady bartender came to take my order, she was very friendly. 
I didn't know what to take so she asked me about my taste and finally she offered me to make a cocktail creation, based on gin, not too sweet and very refreshing. 
The cocktail was great, exactly what I expected, Manon, the bartender, was very friendly and professional, she told me about her life. 
I had a second cocktail and it was as good as the first one ! 
Great experience, amazing cocktail, friendly bartender, I will come back for sure !!",5,2015,11,30
120,Great location,"I visited with my sister for a weekend of London fun. The hotel staff are happy, friendly and appear genuine (not staged). We had some delicious cocktails in the bar, which had a relaxed buzzy atmosphere. The hotel is impeccably clean. The pool was very relaxing but slightly on the chilly side. There is a jet pool next to the swimming pool but the seats are a little high so not very comfortable. It's a shame there isn't a steam room as that would top it off! The pool staff were very friendly. The complimentary coffee in the room was instant and not particularly nice. I would have hoped for filter coffee cups. We were disturbed at 8am by housekeeping. Luckily we were awake, this seemed a little early for an occupied room. The lady was very apologetic and we probably should have had the do not disturb hanger on the door. Later we hung a hanger on the door asking for our room to be freshened but unfortunately we were overlooked. It was too late to follow up when we got back. The toiletries were really nice and smelt lovely. The hotel is in a great location, cool, friendly, clean and comfortable. We will definitely be back. Thanks for a great stay (please get better coffee) xx",4,2015,11,30
120,First stay,"The Hilton Bankside is a nice hotel situated next to Tate Modern with good transportation options.
What makes this hotel really special is the staff. I had to arrange a business dinner for my clients, I asked the help of the concierge Karolis Aleksandravicius for a excellent restaurant. Needles to stay it was a great success. Definitely coming back to stay in the near future.",4,2015,11,30
120,Overnight stay,"We needed a hotel near the Shard and this was about 15 minutes away by walking. This is a new hotel in the Hilton range. I have used the Hiktons in the past and not always found them to be as good as the original brand name. This hotel returns to the original. It is new, the bedroom was a standar room, with king sized bed, and a room bigg enough to move without tripping over. The air con worked, the tv worked, and the shower in the bathroom I wanted to bring home. The room came with standard twoesl etc, including large dressing gowns and 'slippers'. There was no external noise to disturb your sleep, and the only small thing was our room was an inside room overlooking the courtyard facing the other wing, so no view of London. But apart from that, and really on an overnight stay it was not a problem, a really comfortable noght. Breakfast was as good as anywhere, you could have as miuch or as little, cold or hot, very good.
The service is excellent. From the reception at the door, to the checkin, taxi ordering, room cleanliness, and checkout. All very good.",5,2015,11,30
120,Bankside sets the Standard for Hilton,"The brand new Hilton Bankside (just over a month old) is located 5 minutes walk away from Southwark Underground Station on the Jubilee Line.    Having read rave reviews on Tripadvisor prior to my visit, Bankside had a lot to live up to; it did not disappoint!

Check-in: 
I checked-in early and my room was not yet ready.  However, the very pleasant receptionist completed the formalities and advised that she would telephone me as soon as the room was ready, and arranged for my left luggage to be sent up to the room when ready.  As promised, she telephoned later in the afternoon.

Room:
Good size for London and very comfortable, quite, cosy and nicely furnished with a small chez-long.   Rather than having a main ceiling light, light is provided from a number of lamps around the room, though I did struggle a little to the end of the room where the TV is located opening a combination lock on my bag as it was quite dim even with all the lights on.  

Minor Improvements would be option to turn-on further concealed lighting possibly in ceiling recess or behind woodwork of the television area.  Also, another very minor point is the air-conditioning LCD could briefly illuminate when pressing a button at night to be able to clearly read the display, rather than having to turn on the light.

Wardrobe, ironingboard, deposit box etc. cupboards are well concealed in the wood panelling of wide room entrance hallway.  Looks good.

Bathroom:
Spotless as expected, with very nice walk-in shower, with overhead and handheld shower hose.  There is also the option of listening to television audio within the bathroom.  Nightlight is controlled from bedside, so you are not dazzled if you need to get up.

Breakfast/Oxbro Restaurant:
Breakfast is served in the Oxbro restaurant, again staff are outstanding, very polite and ever so helpful, a true credit to the hotel.  Super choice of quality food.  I was a little surprised to find that baked beans are cooked to order, even though there is a huge amount of empty space on the serving hot plate.  A gentleman behind me also asked requested beans, so not really sure what the issue is.  

Interior well designed, with breakfast coffee machines etc. concealed out the way in the evening.

Pool/Gym:
There is a long lap pool along with a small gym in the basement and it was good to see that it was open until 10:00pm during the week.

Security:
When using the lift, you need to present your room-card to the sensor prior to selecting your floor.  

Wi-Fi:
In room wi-fi available but log-in screen did not show tariff, just stated it would be charged to room.  Used mobile data.

Overall:
Hilton have raised the standard with Bankside.  Staff thoughout are charming and the hotel is largely very well designed with quality interiors.

Highly Recommend.",5,2015,11,29
120,Excellent new hotel,"I stayed the week it opened and found it to be an excellent new hotel.
Check-in and check-out were problem free. The staff were all very friendly and couldn't do enough to help.
A king room is an excellent size and beautifully finished. The bathroom is very well appointed too.
I didn't eat dinner at the hotel so cannot comment but I did have a drink in the bar - a vast array of gin to choose from and very knowledgable bar staff to provide advice or make small talk with.
Breakfast was very good - a huge choice of hot and cold foods to suit all requirements.",5,2015,11,29
120,Stunning!,"Myself and my boyfriend have just returned from a fabulous night at this sparkling brand new hotel in London and to say we were impressed would be a massive understatement! When we checked in we were greeted by Ashley (think his last name was Legg) and he was so charming, we have not stayed in a Hilton for a while and our hhonors membership wasn't found on the system so Ashley sighed us back up and also upgraded our room which was very nice of him.  He then took us to the restaurant to introduce us to the reception to book our table for that evening. We then went into the executive lounge for some drinks and canapés to relax before dinner. We have been to a great deal of exec lounges and this has the edge over all the others, the room was very large and homely and beautifully designed. We were looked after so well by Phillipe, he topped up our drinks without us ever needing to ask and chatted with us and he made us feel very pampered. We had dinner at Oxbo which was just WOW, we absolutely LOVED the design and layout of this beautiful restaurant, all the staff were delightful especially Borja who was our waiter, he was wonderful!! We had the bulls head steak for 2 and it was very good, prepared just how we like it and the service throughout from Borja was faultless. We also got chatting to a lovley girl at the front of house (we didn't get her name but was south African) she was very helpful. After dinner we went to the bar for some cocktails, we were only going to stay for 1 but was drawn in by the fabulous decor and service, not to mention the delish cocktails so we had three each! They were prepared by 2 very entertaining Italian guys and we really loved watching them expertly make cocktails and drinks and again service was excellent, we sat up at the bar and everyone around us seemed to be really enjoying themselves. The room was very nice with a really comfy bed and very plush bathroom, we didn't hear anything from inside the room so the soundproofing seems to be very good (there's nothing worse in a hotel than being in a room and hearing other guests in corridors and other rooms!) The breakfast in Oxbo was very good, again, great service and a large selection all beautifully laid out and prepared ( the coffee was also great!!) I know this is a very long review but we really wanted to mention all the very lovley staff who looked after us as well as comment on how beautiful the hotel is! We have stayed in hundreds of hotels over 60 countries and really wanted to give a special mention to this, now one of our favourite hotels in London, if not the world! Can't wait to come back, which will be very soon.",5,2015,11,29
120,Beware room description!,"We stayed for a birthday celebration. We had paid extra for a deluxe room with city view so we were disappointed and surprised to be given a room on 3rd floor looking into an office block opposite. not a city view by any stretch of the imagination! We spoke to reception and were told that in this area we could only expect courtyard views. So why advertise such rooms? It's a gross misrepresentation. We were moved to a 4th floor room which also looked into offices.
This was a great shame as the experience blighted what was in other respects a very enjoyable stay.  Room was very quiet. The pool was lovely - though needs a spin dryer and plastic bags in changing rooms - we had to carry dripping costumes back to the room.
Staff were polite and friendly. Breakfast superb. Had dinner in restaurant which was 
excellent.  Complimentary birthday cake and bubbly much appreciated. Would stay again but would not pay the extra for a city view.",4,2015,11,29
120,Thanksgiving in London,Exceptional new property with staff exceeding all standards for warmth and welcome. Also a very central location for London. The Southwark station is a short walk and easy to connect to any transit line you need to travel around the city. Breakfast was wonderful.,5,2015,11,28
120,Birthday weekend ,"Stayed here for two nights to celebrate a birthday and they did a great job, rang up before hand to tell them it's a birthday and they made it so welcome and nice with the birthday cake and roses on the bed. Fantastic hotel, new build, the interior design is different but clean sharp and modern, which works really well! Loved the hotel, the staff we amazing, everything was spot on and I'll be back to stay here again. Lovely Location as London eye is only 10minute walk from the hotel. Thank you for the stay. ",5,2015,11,28
120,Fabulous,"Our stay was a birthday gift from our daughter.  The hotel is well situated and all the staff were friendly, helpful and chatty :)  Our room was spacious, spotless and quiet. a complimenatry bottle of champagne (for my birthday) with a handwritten card showed the care the staff gave.  We could not fault our stay....will definitely return!",5,2015,11,28
120,"Best manager of reception.., ever!","Family visit in London this past week. Per Granstrom, the manager of reception couldn't have been nicer!! From the moment we arrived, he anticipated our needs and was thorough in his execution. For example, I mentioned that we were planning to take a weekend trip to Cambridge, and when we returned to the hotel later that day, he had an itinerary waiting for us! Per has a true "" can do"" attitude and made us feel welcome and consistently went above and beyond...showing us that he was eager for us to have a wonderful time. He was sociable and such a sweet person.. Attending to every detail to try yi make out trip great. 

This brand new hotel has large rooms, a GREAT breakfast with delicious options, a very nice concierge lounge, gym, comfy bar, and plenty of restaurants with in walking distance. ( avoid the Gordon Ramsay tourist trap Union street cafe, but go to delicious Indian restaurant Mango!) 

Bankside Hilton is a terrific addition to this neighborhood and our family thoroughly enjoyed staying there.. You will too! If you go, please say hi to Per for us!!

120,Overall very good,"Nice new hotel, good staff overall very pleasant. Bar closes very early which is a new one for me in a hotel but would definitely recommend this place. Rooms spacious, comfy beds, good TVs all what you'd expect from a brand new place, it still smells new!",4,2015,11,26
120,Great Hotel,"beautiful new Hotel with a great Bar, Restaurant and Staff. Only thing to mentioned, Reception Staff needs to provide more information on check-in if you have booked a package and on check out to make sure everything has been charged correctly. Minor issues which can be resolved easily and we will definitely stay at your place again.",5,2015,11,25
120,Outstanding new Hilton hotel in London !,You will not be disappointed staying in this great new Hilton hotel. All staff starting with the doorman up to the General Manager are amazingly friendly and attentive. The hotel rooms are very modern and spotless cleaned by housekeeping. Breakfast offers everything you wish for and the service is just amazing. The Executive lounge and Distillery bar are very cozy and great to have a drink with friends. All in all we had an amazing long weekend in this hotel and will definitely come back. Thanks to the Front of House manager Cem for sorting out such a nice room for this special occasion.,5,2015,11,24
120,What a gem!,"Took advantage of one of the opening offers for a 1-night stay. Damn was I glad I did!

What a breath of fresh air to the Hilton portfolio in London. Not only is the hotel very modern, well laid-out, comfortable and stylish furnishings, divine bed etc. ... 100% of the staff is friendly, helpful, proactive, courteous. (Should I go on? - you probably get what I mean by now).

As HHonors Diamond member received access to Exec Lounge AND a voucher for drink at the bar. Breakfast in the lounge was very nice and again personnel more helpful than I ever encountered in any other London hotel. Where did you find those people?

Stayed in a deluxe room that still smelled very new. Was probably just released to the inventory as I learnt the are still adding rooms on a weekly basis.

And yes, probably builders in all countries use the bathtub to get rid of stuff when finishing the rooms and the drain was fairly slow. Or was that just British plumbing?
When I mentioned this to front desk staff, immediate action was taken.

Would I return? Absolutely, most likely making use of HHonors points as I am afraid that the popularity of this hotel will rise rapidly and the rates will go higher than my company would allow.",5,2015,11,24
120,Wo9nderful hotel let down by Reception policy,"We had a one night stay as we both had different events in London last weekend so fancied having a crash pad close by. Our stay nearly didn't happen however! the room was booked in my partner's name, but he was stuck in a client meeting at work so I checked in alone with a friend to get ready for our awards ceremony night out. We got utterly grilled by the receptionist as my partner wasn't present, which I've never experienced before. Despite me confirming his name, address, email address and phone number, the receptionist still kept me waiting and made a phone call - to him in his meeting! was he happy to let me check in?! (of course he was!) she didn't ask my consent nor allow me to warn him by text, it was extremely embarrassing for me, and irritating for him to be interrupted in an important work meeting. I may not share his surname, but why was I still being treated like I didn't know him after confirming all his personal details?

Even more strangely, when he arrived to check in later after his sports event, but before I'd returned from my awards ceremony, he got a similar grilling as he only had a credit card and football season ticket as ID, but no photo ID. they did eventually let him in! 

now I don't mean to seem unreasonable here. this is the week after the Paris attacks, but Hilton Bankside if you need guests to show photo ID, or give full names of guests staying in advance, please warn us in advance. our advance check in email made no mention of this, and the treatment we received really took the edge off an otherwise wonderful stay. 

So onto the positives, which were numerous. Firstly, this is brand new in a exciting area of London by the South Bank and two mins from Tate Modern. The architect is a genius, reflecting Bankside in the style of this hotel giving an industrial chic young look, very different to the more classic Hilton London properties.  Rooms were quiet and comfortable. The cocktails in the Distillery bar memorably good and breakfast simply stunning with a great set up of buffet items and the charismatic Irish lady chef, a real gem. 

My final annoyance was on the day, the website said the pool was not yet open, so I didn't bring swimming gear. however, when I went to look at the pool and gym area, people were swimming in there! it looks lovely though, a good size in an underground level with a good gym, a rare bonus",4,2015,11,23
120,Excellent hotel with attentive Staff,"Stayed here for 1 night recently with Son & His Partner. Excellent service throughout from check in to Executive lounge to Bar to Breakfast. Room was very comfortable with plenty of bathroom amenities & water & soft drinks/nuts in fridge.
Only downside was an otherwise enjoyable meal (with excellent food) was spoilt by some obviously drunken ""Oiks"" who arrived on the next table & who insisted on shouting & swearing amongst themselves for the duration of our meal, without any intervention from the hotel Staff.
Breakfast the following morning was supererb.
Wifi in room very slow. No mobile signal in room.",5,2015,11,22
120,New spot in London,"London has its new spot. Fabulous new hotel, latest generation from Hilton. Expect nothing but convenient, trendy and modern, well thought product. 
Add on that a lovely well trained team who is eager to make you feel under good hands. They are warm and know what you need a step ahead, without ""over"" doing it.
The location has changed so much and is worth coming along. Will definitely come back....",5,2015,11,22
120,"Sunday Lunch, wonderful atmosphere, excellent food and superb value for money, who could ask for more?","Following a recomendation from a friend I took my parents for Sunday lunch at the Bankside Hilton Hotel near Blackfriars Bridge. Stepping into the hotel, the staff were welcoming and genuine. The restaurant itself had a warm, lively atmosphere with live music which added to the vibe without being too intrusive. The sunday lunch was a traditional 3 course roast dinner buffet style, but this wasn t your usual buffet, the food was fantastic, starters included tuna and salmon cerviche which was delicious. The roast beef was to die for, my mother said it was the best roast beef she d tasted (and trust me she's not easily pleased!), There was a wide selection of puddings, from fruit to cheese's to indulgent offerings such as vanilla bean cheesecake and creme brulee, all of which were divine. I don t know how they do it for £28 per person, the quality of the food really was outstanding. Service was excellent, Yacinne, the manager and his team were attentive and helpful, explaining each dish available. Special thanks to our waitress, Fantasia and the Sommelier who recommended a lovely Malbec to accompany our meal. We will definitely be back.

120,Excellent quiet base,"faultless stay frim start to finish.  my sis and I wanted somewhere to chill and catch up so booked a twin room. room is large with big beds, v cool facilities like thick floor length dressing gowns, fluffy slippers and top notch toiletries.  has a v comfortable night. tv is fab, decor is minimalist but not like a stale business hotel. 
fav was bathroom with slate floor in shower,  2 shower heads and v easy access in and out of shower. we had a very quiet room 104.
we ate rather a lot and drank quite a few cocktails in the swanky distillery bar.  There is an on site restaurant but we preferred the extensive range of tapaa snacks in bar.
buttermilk chicken still making my mouth water. crab also v good. 
only small feedback is that a mirror wld have been handy in the room. There is are 2 mirrors in bathroom incl a cosmetic one but need one in room by power switch to be able to do hair.  There are long length mirrors inside wardrobe but this is far from power switches. 
enjoyed using the deep drawer fridge. lots of space and no fiddling abt. sainsburys local and Costa next to hotel and a c nice place called The Table if you turn left out of hotel and right again.
v friendly staff who kindly let us check out an hr later. 
will be back. ",5,2015,11,21
120,"Attended an event nearby, a very enjoyable stay","The hotel was located 10 minutes away from the underground station and I can go to bond street via jubilee line which is quite convenient.

Pool is not opened yet. Gym was okay. Wifi was a bit slow.

I arrived the hotel at 10 pm at night so the doorman was not present when i arrive. I have to take all my luggages to my room myself. Otherwise the other staff are very friendly always a smile on their face, and they are very efficient too.",4,2015,11,21
120,A very enjoyable stay,"Got an advance booking deal and were the first to stay in the room.  Good location.  Friendly, helpful staff.  Quiet room, corporate decor.  The complimentary birthday dessert in our room was a lovely personal touch.  A very enjoyable stay.",5,2015,11,20
120,"Fantastic Hotel, Even Better Staff!","I stayed in this new hotel for a business trip 12-14 November and thoroughly enjoyed the experience. As a new hotel you expect the rooms, facilities and general decor to be first rate and it certainly doesn't disappoint. What really stands out is the performance of the staff. Without exception, everyone I came into contact with was friendly, helpful, professional and keen to go the extra yard to make my stay more pleasant. It seems unfair to single out individuals but I have to reserve special praise for Antony at Reception, Ramatin in the restaurant, head bartender Riccardo and especially the chef at breakfast when I stayed - Rachel, a teddy bear of an Irishwoman from County Clare. Top marks to the HR and training manager at this Hilton hotel - whatever criteria you use to hire and train is clearly working.",5,2015,11,19
120,"Great property, Fantastic staff, Good location","The hotel is immaculate - as expecte from a brand new property

Room upgrade, as HHonors diamond, to a deluxe room and had free water/soft drinks and peanuts/gummi-bears in mini-bar - not sure if this related to the room category or was a diamond amenity. Very nice gesture!

Exec Lounge is very nice - and also quiet, perhaps as hotel not yet fully operational. Staff very attentive and keen on serving drinks for you...though I prefer to serve myself. Evening snacks in the lounge were limited compared to other hiltons, but all nicely put together. Breakfast in the lounge was, by comparison, quite comprehensive. Have some of the house-roasted granola!

This hotel is well worth a visit if the location suits. I will certainly return.",5,2015,11,18
120,Great Service,"This hotel is fairly new, good décor and wonderful staff. The ambience was relaxing and the bar staff were extremely attentive. Service with a smile and welcoming which you don't often see in London hotels. The bar man who served us ""Ciprian"" really knew his cocktails well. The manager came over and spent some time talking to us which made us feel even more welcomed. Definitely worth a visit, I would like to stay here the next time. ",5,2015,11,18
120,Fantastic weekend experience - will definitely stay again!,"Myself and my 8 year old son stayed at the Hilton Bankside on Sat 14th November to Sun 15th November. On arrival we were greeted by Anthony on Reception who was extremely friendly and professional. He checked us in and was very helpful in giving us directions to where we wanted to go providing me with a map. 

The room we stayed in (twin) was spacious, very clean (hotel is brand new!) and modern. Our beds were very comfortable and the room perfect for us. When we arrived back to our room in the evening, there was a cake waiting for my son saying 'Happy birthday' which my husband had arranged with the hotel. It was a lovely touch. 

The following morning I enquired about breakfast being free for children as that was what I'd read in the guest room information. The lady I spoke to said their policy had recently changed to being half price but of course she would honour it and not charge for my son's breakfast. We were welcomed into the restaurant by a very friendly Waiter called Alex who set about serving us immediately. He was so helpful in preparing my breakfast (from the A La Carte menu) how I wanted it and was very attentive. My son enjoyed the hot buffet and the Chef (a lovely friendly lady) set about making my son waffles to try with all 3 sauces! 

After our breakfast our Waiter Alex asked about our stay and was helpful advising us re museums and recommended the 'duck bus tour'. I had mentioned we wanted to do a bus tour but wasn't keen on the long running time and Alex told us how the duck bus only takes approximately an hour and goes on both road and river! Naturally my son's face lit up at this idea! He said if I wanted to book, the Concierge would be happy to do this for us - which we agreed to. 

Bill (Concierge) was very proficient in phoning up and booking the tour for us at the time we wanted, we were able to pay him directly and he printed the tickets for us there and then. He too was very kind and helpful and engaged with my son - told us about the 'foxes' the Architect had hidden around the hotel as a little design quirk!
That day we left our luggage at the hotel until late that evening when we collected it for the journey back home. 

I can not praise this hotel enough for the fantastic and friendly service given all round, and for the lovely facilities. I will definitely use this hotel again when staying in London!",5,2015,11,17
120,Fabulous Friday Night Stay,"This is a gorgeous hotel, it's really on trend and is furnished in a very contemporary way. We had dinner in the hotels restaurant, which was a real treat for my partners Birthday. The restaurant setting with open kitchen was lovely and the food was top notch! We walked off our fullness with a late night stroll along the Thames. The rooms were comfortable and offered everything you'd need. We also had a Hilton breakfast in the morning, which offered us endless choice and this set us up for our day of London shopping! The staff couldn't do enough for us, so thank you to everyone at the Hilton London Bankside for making my partners Birthday so special. ",5,2015,11,17
120,Fabulous hotel,"I stayed 2 nights with a friend and had a fantastic time.  ALL the staff couldn't have been nicer.  They were extremely helpful, well mannered, well presented,  courteous and pleasant.  The room accommodation was excellent- clean, fresh, excellent beds along with quality bedding and towels and we had a lovely meal in the restaurant on one of the evenings.  Breakfast was also great with lots of variety.  I could not recommend this hotel higher.  Well done to all concerned and thank you for a great stay.",5,2015,11,16
120,First class service and comfortable.,"From the moment we arrived to the moment we left, we experienced first class service from ALL of the staff and were made to feel very welcome-nothing appeared to be too much trouble.
The hotel is extremely well and comfortably appointed with tasteful decor and furnishings and very comfortable beds.
Overall, I could not fault it and would very happily stay again.

I",5,2015,11,16
120,Brand New!,"I stayed here for 1 night and walked into the inauguration party in full swing - what a welcome!! The hotel had only been open for 1 month and you could feel the quality in all the fixture and fittings.  The staff were very attentive and I was pleased with the (for me, unxpected!) touches... Whilst out for dinner (in the delicious OXBO Hotel Restaurant) someone came in prepared my room for sleeping and turned down the bed! 
The next day we used the conference center for the day and everything went smoothly.",5,2015,11,15
120,Overall good - but  a couple of niggles,"On the positive side the place is immaculately clean and well appointed. The staff encounted were very helpful and seemed genuinely interested in their guests comfort.  I was surprised that a 5* hotel did not have a hair-dryer in the rooms?  It’s clear the hotel is still suffering a few teething problems, for example, the fire alarms had been triggered due to smoke from the kitchen which meant that the lifts were out of action on our arrival.  However we were offered a drink in the bar if we had elected not to use the stairs. Overall, when the teething issues have been sorted and the pool opened, the hotel will be well worth of their 5* rating.",4,2015,11,15
120,Exceptional new hotel,"I stayed at this hotel last week on a business trip to London and was made to feel very welcome by the front of house and restaurant staff. The hotel is very new and it is in a nice location quite near to the Thames waterfront, although it is a little walk from Southwark tube station. As I was catching the train the next morning at Waterloo, it was easier to take a taxi to the station which cost £7. I thought the breakfast menu was exceptionally good and I would rate this as one of the best Hilton Hotels I have stayed in. I will definitely return on my next visit to London.",5,2015,11,14
120,Brand New but has some teething problems,"Great check in - very friendly and very personal.  Looked after a bag for me during the day without fuss. Very stylish public areas.
Received upgrade due to status and also had access to lounge.
Lounge is fantastic, probably one of the smartest and largest I have seen in a Hilton (certainly in the UK anyhow).  Unfortunately staff perhaps are perhaps a bit new - asked for a porridge at breakfast and first of all they said it wasnt possible, then said it was, then waited 20 mins for it but gave up and left. Mentioned at reception but just a short sorry, will let the manager know type response.
Unfortunately pool is not open as yet - nobody knew how long it would be to sort out.
Bar area looks good but it was very quiet and didnt venture in.
There is apparently a very concealed cupboard in the room - contains a safe and hair dryer but it is so well disguised I couldnt find it.
Will go back for sure - hopefully teething problems are fixed by then.
No great views from the lower floor (stayed on 3). Lots of restaurants nearby also.",4,2015,11,14
120,Stunning hotel room 204 ,"Stayed in a spacious twin room with my mum in November. Hotel staff very friendly and efficient. bar is lovely. 

Room was spotless with plenty of plug sockets, maid service fantastic. Lovely tv in room with sound linked into the bathroom. Rooms large in comparison to usual 5* London hotels. 

Plenty of wardrobe space. 

Gordon Ramsey Union street cafe just around the corner for nice drinks lunch or dinner. Borough market walking distance. 

Breakfast in hotel is expensive so take a walk out where there are plenty of cafes hidden away. 

Having used to live in London, staying in this area managed to see a different side of the city. 

Looks just like the pics. Brand new. Fresh and modern. 

The nicest Hilton hotel I have stayed in. ",5,2015,11,14
120,Amazing party!,We were recently invited to a party at the hotel. It's a gorgeous venue. More stylish and modern than I would normally expect from a Hilton. The entrance and the space for the party were all really impressive. The food was fantastic and the service staff could not have done a better job at taking care of us! I would definitely recommend having a party here!!!,5,2015,11,12
120,Comfortable business accommodation with great service,"I stayed at the Hilton Bankside as I was at a conference there. The staff were very welcoming and went out of there way to be helpful. I was upgraded on arrival to a deluxe room which was very comfortable with luxury toiletries in the bathroom. The mini bar was well stocked. Overall a very pleasant stay - I would certainly stay there again as it is very central and as a new hotel it was modern, clean and well designed.",4,2015,11,11
120,"Great location, tasty food, wonderful service!","I've been invited to celebrate a surprise birthday party of a friend of mine and let me tell you - I had such an amazing time! It's always great to see your friends but surroundings can make it even more exceptional. I can't stop praising the staff, so tentative, polite, helpful, charming with a big smile on their faces! The hotel itself is brand new, smells like a promise of a great adventure and I love its location. Thank you for making me a part of this experience. Big thumb up :-)",5,2015,11,11
120,"Brilliant location, extremely professional and attentive staff!","Great hotel, in a very nice location. Really liked the décor, it is modern but in a very warm way. The rooms are really nicely decorated and bathroom was good size and super clean! Dinner was very tasty and staff extremely helpful and very professional. Awesome experience overall! Definitely recommend it.",5,2015,11,11
120,Great night out,Recently had the pleasure of going to a 'surprise' 40th party here. The service staff were very attentive and friendly. The hotel itself has great design - modern and trendy fitting into the local area well. The function rooms for parties downstairs are equipped with everything you could need. Food was amazing!!! Would definitely recommend staying this hotel and throwing a party!!!,5,2015,11,10
120,The Location is very good,"The Location of this is very good. You are in the City of London an. Everything is in walking distance. When you take the gatwick express you can walk from victoria station to this hotel.The Borough Market, London Eyes, Big Ben, Westminster Abbey is very closed to this hotel.",3,2015,11,10
120,Hilton Lond Bankside - Southwark,"Great Hilton Hotel, fabulous attentive staff, especially Neil (concierge), great décor, breakfast wow!!  I would definitely recommend and would consider returning not on business, what a fab experience that everyone should have a little taste of.  Oh and the lobby smells divine.",5,2015,11,10
120,Great new hotel in London!,"Hilton is facing fierce competition in London from boutique hotels and its great to see they have stepped up their game with this new one! Hotel is great, more up to date than most classic Hiltons l've been too. We have attended private party in the bar downstairs. Very attentive staff. Great food. Full professionalism. I would definitely recommend it for corporate & private events. The building is brand new so you get to treat yourself with unused amenities :)",4,2015,11,10
120,Outstanding Service,"What an amazing hotel, I have never stayed in a hotel with such impeccable service and attention to detail. Normally you would find one or too staff members who would shine, but not in this hotel, all members of staff I interacted with during my four night stay could not do enough for you, customer service was key and you can certainly see each member of staff has been trained exceptionally well. A nice located hotel,bedroom was clean big and very well fitted with some nice touches such a hidden fridge in a draw. Bathroom was lovely, nice hot shower each morning. Breakfast was great, with a really good choice, a nice chef cooked me an omelette each morning and I was greeted with a huge smile, wish I had got his name. Restaurant manager was really nice, polite and helpful on the first morning, especially as it was an early start due to fog!. 
We ate in the restaurant just once during our stay, very good service with attention to detail again with napkins on your lap and wine served, felt more like a upper class restaurant than a hotel one.
Concierge were the best I have dealt with in a long time, especially Xavier who was so helpful and polite in arranging Taxi's .
Not to mention housekeeping who were so friendly and happy in their job when I interacted with them.
One final comment would be the story regarding the foxes, don't want to spoil it for others, but ask about them when you get to the hotel, and look out for them!  A nice touch which makes this Hilton unique in its own right.

My one and only criticism, would be the bar, it closes at 11.00 even to residents, as I understand the hotel has not yet gained a full licence . Please tell people this up front, don't hide it, tell them upfront on the website, you have a magnificent hotel and this is a minor detail which could affect you.

I will 100 per cent stay at this hotel again should I be in the area again, I hope it's soon !
 ",5,2015,11,09
120,Conrad miles better ,"Wish I had gone for my usual choice @ Conrad, small suite, rubbish executive lounge with one hot item that I couldn't even eat (am vego) and cheap wine. Expected better for £250/night, would not recommend 

Local area is ghastly and run down miles to anywhere decent unless you want a nandos!",2,2015,11,09
120,Excellent hotel on the South Bank of the Thames,"I stayed at the Hilton London Bankside in the 30th October - 1st November weekend and I can sum it up as excellent.
The hotel is on the South Bank of the Thames, a five minute walk from the Southwark Underground Station (Jubilee Line) and from the Tate Modern and the Millennium Bridge.
I stayed in a King Deluxe Room with View, but the view was the only thing faulty in it. Infact the room was obviously new, as the hotel has recently opened, very large by London standard and beautifully appointed, while the view was very underwhelming, pointing west and showing only a recognizable 5% slice of London Eye.
The only defect in the room (and it was a very minor one) was that there was too many pieces of furniture around for its size.
As a HHonors diamond guest I was given access to the Executive Lounge at ground floor and found it a pretty one, large and never busy, even if the food offering at the Hilton Canary Wharf were better.

All in all it has been a beautiful experience and I can recommend a stay in this hotel to everyone, especially at weekends with the lower rates (mine was £ 152 per night).",5,2015,11,09
120,Very good considering its just opened,"Stayed at this hotel at the end of October and I think it had only been opened 3 weeks at that point. The receptionist that checked me in was amazing and I am so annoyed at myself for not remembering her name. All the staff were nice, but the lady in question was super sweet...PJ was also very nice when I was checking out (yes I remember PJ but not the lady that gave me a free drinks voucher for getting stuck in the lift and was just an all round awesome receptionist!)

Anyhoo, the room was nice with that lovely new smell (I like) although I was facing the AC units/extractors that were nicely disguised, there was still enough sunlight coming into the room  and as I was only staying for a day, the view did not really bother me. I love the pull out fridge but as a previous reviewer has pointed out where the ironing board is kept is too discreet to the point that one does not even realise there is a door there. It was only upon asking housekeeping for my slippers they said to look in the cupboard and it took a good 5 mins to find this ""secret"" door! 

I like the idea of going an making your tea/coffee for yourself, as I really do get quite tired of waiting for staff to bring it, and 99%of the time it is never piping hot, so the set up they have works well for me, BUT how well that would work if they are at say 70% capacity for breakfast remains to be seen as I suspect there would be a queue.

The middle lift needs looking at as myself and another guest (on separate occasions) sort of got stuck in the lift (it closed but then would not go up from the basement) 

The hotel is listed as a 5* but other than the turn down service I honestly cant see how it is any different to the 4* Hiltons I have stayed in, such as Wembley, Canary Wharf, Reading, or London Bridge, maybe its the turn down service that classifies it a 5 star?? 

My only real issue with this hotel was the AC unit and restaurant , they have the AC set on the auto thing that has been centrally set, it was annoying as I just want to be able to adjust my temperature to what I feel like without all the palava. 

The restaurant, I get is new so still finding their feet, BUT if the menu says bread and butter pudding with toffee sauce, I expect that, and if it has been substituted inform guests before they order as what I ended up getting was a blueberry bread n butter pudding (bread and butter pudding does not traditionally contain blueberries!) and it was some sort of cream and nothing even resembling toffee and the quality in general was not great. On the kids menu it states ""make your own sundae"" no such option was offered to my son to choose his toppings etc, what was presented  was an overly rich, summer fruits ice cream concoction.. so again if you are offering xxx please be sure to deliver xxx and if one cant deliver xxx, be sure to inform diners of this beforehand.

On my stay it was apparent someone that worked within the hotel came in for dinner with his girlfriend (I was sat next to them) he did not appear to be an executive board level employee, but whomever he was, the waiters attentions were focused on him to the point where before he sat down my plate was whipped away in a timely fashion and once this other person came in, my plate was left there longer than it should and my bill took longer than it should given there were only about 10 diners as they were all so busy making small talk with this person.

Now I am all for making a good impression for your boss etc, however the hotel is in it infancy and gaining and retaining (PAYING) guests should be your priority right now and making a fuss over staff members at the expense of fellow diners, even at management level is not going to win you any favours.

Other than the couple issues it was a nice stay, and I would certainly return but only once the pool has opened",4,2015,11,07
120,Love the new boutique style!,"Stayed last night in an executive room. Fabulous all round for a brand new hotel which isn't fully open. Lovely check in staff, brilliant bar staff, wonderful waiting staff. Not your usual Hilton - much better style, rooms are very chic (only criticism there is no mirror in bedroom for drying your hair or putting your makeup on - only full length mirror in wardrobe). The executive lounge is fantastic as was the breakfast - so much choice! Ideally situated for borough market, the Tate, south bank etc. All round stunner - we will return",5,2015,11,07
120,My new favorite hotel,"I took a chance and booked a room at this brand new property in an area of London I wasn't familiar with, and I'm glad I did. As a Gold Honors member, I know that all Hiltons are not created equal, but this one exceeded all my expectations.  The location turned out to be perfect. The rooms were very modern and spotless. The staff was wonderful and accommodating, especially when I wasn't happy with my first night's room.  Not only did they offer to change my room, but they gave me the opportunity to view and select my new room.  A special shout out to the bartenders in the Distillery Bar.  If my travels bring me back to London, I will definitely return.",5,2015,11,04
120,Best Hilton in London,"Stayed in this hotel last weekend, for me this is the best London hotel I have stayed in. Great service and very friendly staff. I am coming back to London next month and I have already booked a room :)",5,2015,11,04
120,Great new hotel - and great staff - good combination!,"As others have mentioned, this hotel is very new and therefore it does feel quite a special place to be, because everything is clean and the team are very motivated! 

The Exec room I am in is big, with a huge comfortable bed and all standard Hilton bathroom amenities. Nice, classy wood panelling and very quiet even though it's on the first floor - can't hear a thing from downstairs or outside. Oh, and enough power sockets by the bed - two on each side - so no annoyances about having to charge your phone on the other side of the room as happens in some hotels!

At the moment the upper floors aren't available (I expect they are still being completed) and that's a shame as the view from floor 1 isn't quite the cityscape suggested by the marketing! Also the pool isn't open yet but that's made clear in advance on the Hilton website and app.

The hotel is quirky, with lots of interesting features - so it's not just a corporate copy of a ""standard"" Hilton.   I didn't get to see the bar which was a shame - it closes at 11pm, even for residents - I think they are trying to extend the licence - just teething problems with a brand new hotel I suspect.

I'll look forward to coming back when the pool and the upper floors are open - as it's so close to my London base, I think this hotel could become my regular !",4,2015,11,04
120,Not nearly the best Hilton...,"A disappointing visit. Check in was slow, when finally we got to room it was four dark walls with no window; light came from small window in passage to bathroom only. Dismal and dark - requested a room change and received a better room with a window! Highpoint was the Distillery Bar; high class cocktail bar with skilled and knowledgeable bar staff - who knew so many brands of gin existed! Breakfast was very 'self-service' not even tea and coffee brought to table - a coffee machine was pointed out to us - dreadful coffee! I would not stay again - prefer Tower of London or London Bridge Hilton Hoteld",2,2015,11,03
120,The Distillery Bar is ideal for post-work drinks,Checked out the hotel's bar after work last week and was really impressed by the service and drinks made by two knowledgeable barmen. Worth a visit if you're looking for a cosy place for drinks around Bankside.,4,2015,11,03
120,Fabulous new hotel !,"Stayed here last week for the first time ....hotel location is great - only 5 mins walk from Southwark tube station so easy to find.  Great welcome from the doorman and receptionist.  Stunning features around the building emulating the whole ""bank"" history of the building and the area.  Our room was clean and had great features, large bathroom and subtle classy décor.  We had dinner in the restaurant and the food was superb....catering well for children (not always seen in corporate style hotels midweek) and the restaurant and bar were buzzing with atmosphere (unusual as the hotel has only just opened so obviously word as spread fast !!!).  Great breakfast next day, meticulous attention to detail in the food layout and quality.   Loved this hotel and we will definetly be back !!",5,2015,11,02
120,Stunning hotel,"Stayed for one night with my wife and son and had a wonderful time in a beautiful hotel. Located just behind the Tate Modern, it's obvious upon walking into the spacious reception area that this hotel is special. Check in was dealt with swiftly by a very friendly member of staff. We were lucky enough to have a suite in the corner of the building, which was fitted out with enormous attention to detail and luxury. We had dinner in the restaurant and again, the service was very good and the food was superb. I would describe the atmosphere as very modern and chic. Breakfast the following morning was also excellent and the choice of food on offer was extensive. I would definitely recommend this hotel!",5,2015,11,02
120,Brand New Hilton London Bankside Delights,"The hotel was four days old when I got there. Yet they already had their act together because staff are mostly seasoned pros from other hotels. 

Room service called to tell me that my breakfast would be a few minutes late as they were baking my scones fresh! What??? The Distillery bar is a fascinating spot for a cocktail preferably from one of the vintage gins no longer available! The gin list is incredible. And the head bartender is a snappy Italian star who makes lovely infusions and syrups for his cocktails.

Location is great. Just a short wander to The Tate or Borough Market and several really good restaurants. The tube is nearby too.",4,2015,10,30
120,My new favourite London Hilton,"I am a Hilton diamond member as a result of spending far too much of my time in hotels, usually in London.  I do like the Canary Wharf Hilton as that is a short walk from my office but I think the style of the Bankside just edges it out as my favourite.  The executive lounge is like a gentleman's club (in the sense of style, not exclusivity!) and the rooms are stylish and well appointed.  I had a first floor room, which can be a problem, but I heard no sound from the ground floor.

The staff couldn't be nicer - they are clearly delighted to be a part of the hotel and aim to please at all times, though not in an intrusive way.

If I was asked for potential improvements I would suggest two things.  Firstly provide a walking route map on the website.  I had looked the location up on Google maps but still managed to arrive via a roundabout route (though my sense of direction is not the best).

Secondly, put a card on the desk pointing out where the iron and ironing board are.  I couldn't find them anywhere and a phone call downstairs revealed that they were actually behind a door which was so well engineered that I hadn't even noticed it.

In short a great experience which I hope doesn't get diluted as more rooms are made available.",5,2015,10,30
120,Refreshingly different!,"Having spent more nights than I can remember in various Hilton Group hotels in and around London (and farther afield), I nervously booked this brand new Hilton property to try somewhere new.
What a hugely pleasant surprise I got! This is more like a boutique hotel but with Hilton levels of service and I was made to feel very special during my stay. Being a HH Diamond level, I had access to the wonderful executive lounge, which has loads of character and art installations. Talking of art, the restaurant has its own art work. I won't spoil the surprise but just look at the walls on the way in!

The bedrooms are well appointed, with lots of wood panelling, making it feel very cozy. The bed, for me, was perfect in both size and hardness.

The staff are more than helpful, and most remember your name after a couple of meetings.

Anything I requested was dealt with in a professional and swift manner.

Breakfast was excellent and eggs are made to order, with the exception of scrambled.

There is still some construction work going on around the hotel but this has minimal impact on the guests.

All in all, it was a wonderful stay, and I look forward to revisiting this wonderful property.

James and his staff should be justifiably proud of this property! Special thanks to Ana the Guest Services manager.",5,2015,10,30
120,Great team working at this stylish new hotel,"Two weeks after it opened, we found the hotel stylish and comfortable and the staff eager to please and working well as a team.
On arrival the concierge was friendly and parked the car in their secure car park on site. Check in was equally pleasant. There seemed to be a very large number of staff around all the time and I could n't fault any of them.

The immediate environs of the hotel are not the most stimulating- there are a few restaurants and cafes quite close, not really any shopping around here. The Tate Modern is minutes away, the City of London with St Paul's Cathedral is an easy walk across the Millennium foot bridge, and there is a tube stop quite close. Taxi to the west end is £15 to £20. The room rates were very reasonable when we stayed, maybe some promotional rates on Hilton site at opening, so the costs worked out fine but if you want to be in the midst of things, this is slightly off the beaten track. The plus side is that it was very quiet at night.

The room was stylish and well appointed. Big comfortable bed and nice linen. Excellent shower.

The restaurant for breakfast was very nice- lots of variety. I would have preferred tea and coffee pots to be served, rather than having to keep replenishing from a machine. Lots of interesting cocktails in the attractive bar in the evening before we went out but it was a bit disappointing to find on our return that it had closed at 11.00 pm.
The pool hadn't yet been completed when we stayed, but judging by the standard of the rest of the hotel I am sure it will be impressive and we look forward to trying it on a return visit, which is definitely on the cards. Oh I forgot to say that Shakespeare's Globe Theatre is very nearby, on the riverside, and there are various other bars and restaurants around there too.",4,2015,10,29
120,Excellent business hotel,Excellent business hotel; modern but very stylish! Well done by the designers. Very professional and friendly staff. Five minutes walk to southwark underground station and waterloo railway station. Tate Modern and Shakespeare's Globe are close by. Southwark has been very much revitalised and this hotel is one of the great additions.,5,2015,10,29
120,Top class hotel,Really enjoyed this hotel. As a Hilton Gold member I've stayed in a lot of Hiltons but this one is very unique. The interior design is akin to a boutique hotel and no expense has been spared on the fixtures and fittings in the rooms. You could tell the hotel has been newly opened as the staff were still a little unsure of systems and it was obvious they hadn't had a chance to build up relationships with each other yet. That will come as any new staff team needs time to gel and bond. I had left my jacket in the executive lounge and the hotel went above and beyond the call of duty to find it for me. Thanks and I will definitely be back next time I'm in London.,5,2015,10,27
120,It will be excellent once it gets established,"This is a new hotel and I am sure that once it gets properly up and running it will be fantastic. There is nothing that can be faulted about the quality of the rooms, beds, pillows and bathroom facilities. And the location is excellent - 3 minutes walk from Tate Modern, 10 minutes from Waterloo and about 15 from the Covent Garden area. It's just that nothing seemed to go smoothly when dealing with the staff. Whether that was because there is a lack of experience amongst them or whether the hotel has opened before it is ready, something was not quite right. The staff were all very friendly and trying to be helpful but they did seem a bit lost. My case was taken off me when I arrived and I was told it would be taken straight to my room but it never arrived and 40 minutes later I rang reception to find out what had happened to it. A few minutes later there were two members of staff at my door but no case. They were not sure who I was. Once they knew, one of them returned with my case. But it did seem a bit chaotic. Had I known, I would have just carried it up the stairs myself. There were similar mini-dramas around getting key cards to work to open doors in the public areas. Even when my cards were re-programmed, they would not open the door to the stairs but nobody ever seemed to understand quite what I was talking about. So it's fine, just be tolerant of the poor staff who did seem to be trying their best but seemed a bit lost.",4,2015,10,27
120,Amazing property with franchise owners that need to teach the rest.,"Whilst this is a new property I hope they keep the service levels up. The franchise owners know what they are doing and I wished their quality would rub off on others in the Hilton family. Fantastic decor, amazing staff across all parts of the hotel. Classy, stylish and modern with a zen Scandinavian vibe in the room.",5,2015,10,27
120,Superb New Hilton,"Had the pleasure of staying here for one night midweek. 
On arrival we were greeted by concierge staff, we were welcomed to the hotel, all luggage was carried  from the car, the keys were signed for and the car was parked and of course duly returned at the end of our stay.
We then made our way to reception where we were greeted warmly, checked in and all details of the hotel explained.
During our stay we used the hotel bar both day time and evening and the restaurant both for breakfast and an evening meal.  
The restaurant meal was excellent as was the service.  
The breakfast was probably one of the best hotel breakfasts I have experienced again the level of service is to be commended.  
The ambience of the hotel in all areas including the restaurant is pitched at the right level of  interesting and quirkiness.  With an eclectic mix of modern and some traditional items of decor.
The bedroom was a pleasant size, very nicely furnished, plenty of towels and toiletries,  complimentary bar and one of the most comfortable beds I have slept on ! It was immaculate ( maybe to be expected considering the hotel was only two weeks old )

The staff throughout our stay were very helpful, they seemed to be a high ratio of staff , all trained to a consistently high level.
A man who I assume is the manager was visibly present within areas of the hotel ,  conversing with both staff and guests, which was refreshing.

All reception staff, in particular the concierge staff , Neil Cowan and his team greeted us when ever we were passing through reception and took an interest in our day and were incredibly helpful. So many thanks to them! 

Overall an extremely enjoyable hotel and one which I will look forward to returning to soon.",5,2015,10,26
120,Warm and welcoming hotel,"We spent just one night and this Newly opened hotel and were so sorry we hadn't booked another night. The hotel is lovely, but the staff are what made it very special, they got the balance of unobstrusive helpful just right, there when you needed them and not when you didn't. 
The bed and particularly the pillows were very comfortable. The room we had was spacious and well-equipped. 
Breakfast was plentiful and of a high standard, they will even cook pancakes to order. 
The leisure centre was not yet open, but hopefully it will be next time. 
The location is in a quiet rather non descript area but is so close to the Tate Modern and South Bank that there are plenty of restaurants and bars just a few minutes away.
An excellent hotel. ",5,2015,10,26
120,Fabulous in every way!,"Stayed for 1 night for my birthday. Staff couldn't have been more friendly and couldn't do enough for you. 5 minute walk from Southwark and close the Southbank.  The rooms are spacious and the bathroom was stunning. The bed was so comfy didn't want to get up!  The Restaurant was amazing, relaxed atmosphere, fabulous food and very attentive, friendly staff. Because it was my birthday I was given a complementary bottle of Lanson with our meal. Such a lovely thoughtful touch. The bar does some amazing innovative cocktails.  Can't fault the hotel in any way! Would definitely recommend this hotel and we will return.",5,2015,10,25
120,Superb short break in the city,Superb stay - hotel is brand new and staff are so friendly and proud of the property.  Location is great - 5 minutes from tube great rooms great restaurant.  So impressed I am back next week and this is my new go to hotel in London!  Special thanks to Kiana (sorry if I spelt that wrong!) super friendly and always took time to say hello,5,2015,10,23
120,Absolutely fantastic in every way,"This hotel has very quickly become my favorite. it is a very unique Hilton and the concept and design is simply stunning. 

The rooms are lovely, with simple and comfort written all over them, the bed was super comfy and the shower was so good I didn't want to get out.

Following on from this, I had lunch in OXBO which was outstanding, the staff were very helpful and took the time to talk to us and recommend dishes from the menu.",5,2015,10,23
120,Service from a Hilton Hotel at the Highest Level,"Stayed for three nights during October, 2 weeks after they opened.

I count myself very lucky as the hotel originally said they were opening at the end of October and I needed a stay mid-October .... and as fate would have it they opened early ... what a find.

The first thing I have to say, and I notice commented in previous reviews, is the level of service by all the staff throughout the hotel ... and I mean all ... it is stunning.... if all Hiltons could be the same!!!!

The hotel itself feels a little like the Conrad St James in its styling and I was told during the stay that they are both owned by the same people.

I was surprised by the closeness of Southwark tube station (at most 5 mins walk) on one side or if you want the RV1 bus to either Tower Bridge/Tower of London or Southbank/Waterloo and Covent Garden on the other side (all within 10 mins ride).

The Executive Lounge is one of the best I have used in London .... a great size but with a nice Club feel. Next door to it is the restaurant which doubles for breakfast. Another great space with a lot of options in the morning from freshly cooked pancakes and omelettes by the chef to a great array of continental choice.

The bar looked great but did not have time to actually use it. Around the area the hotel is sited there is also a Gordon Ramsay restaurant.

Bottom line ...... already planning to revisit in the next month and making it a regular stay.",5,2015,10,21
120,"One word, Amazing!","Stayed at the newly opened Hilton Bankside and was blown away by the high standards of the hotel.

The lobby area is beautiful as is the amazing executive lounge. The suite we stayed in was furnished to a very high standard and the complimentary soft drinks and snacks in the minibar is definitely a very nice touch.

The staff are fantastic, really helpful especially the staff in the Executive Lounge.

The food at breakfast is good quality and there is plenty of choice.

So far, i have stayed here twice since it opened and cant wait to go back a third time.",5,2015,10,20
120,weekend break,"absolutey fantastic hotel, the staff were top class, the accomadation 5 star, the breakfast excellent, location perfect. The only negative is the bar, they automatically assume you want double measures and as the drinks are  expensive to start with, it was a bit of a shock.I t didn't spoil our stay we just didn't use the bar again.",5,2015,10,19
120,Excellent Hotel / Brilliant Staff,"I recently stayed at this hotel for two nights. It's a brand new hotel that has just opened! And is only a few minutes’ walk from SouthWark Station. The staff are all very friendly and helpful. 
I stayed in the Executive King Room which included Free Drinks & Snacks. The Hotel being brand new is very modern. The room was brand new! I was surprised the hotel offered a turn down service at night where the room is also cleaned again. The room had a very good bathroom with a powerful rainfall shower and bose speaker integration!  The room also had a 47"" Smart TV which had youtube apps etc. The Wi-Fi Speed using speedtest.net was 2.5mb/s using the free in room wi-fi service. The rooms are well insulated and very quiet. The climate control system is excellent and keeps the room at a good temperature. Outside the hotel you have a tesco express, Sainsbury’s and costa coffee on the door step. 
I would definitely stay here again and would give it a rating of 10/10.",5,2015,10,18
120,This was a rare pleasure......,"A brand new hotel, with happy and excited staff and very good facilities in a great part of London. Nearly made up for very disappointing stay in Hilton Park Lane the previous week: so bad I almost cancelled here. Glad I didn't.  It is a lovely place to stay. Staff were just great.",5,2015,10,18
120,"Lovely hotel, new and modern","Room was smart and modern, staff attentive, lovely breakfast. Turn down service had our room ready for us to jump straight into bed after a night on the town. 
Worth having a few cocktails in the bar, ask about the free cocktail voucher. Would highly recommend. 😀",5,2015,10,18
120,5 Star Luxury in the Heart of London,"Excellent brand new Hilton close to the London Bridge with excellent amenities, service and food.  Excellent value for the money, however the lodging and food expense was reduced based on just opening.  The cuisine is some of the best I have experienced in London.",5,2015,10,17
120,My new favourite hotel!,"Just stayed one night and was hugely impressed
The hotel is as you would expect from a brand new Hilton with lovely decor
The room was spacious with a great bathroom but what really made it great was the exceptional service from every single member of staff I came into contact with

Would highly recommend",5,2015,10,16
120,Very New Hotel with Great Service,"The hotel opened just last week so it was great that room was super clean. They didn't open the entire hotel however, staffs, especially at the reception, were absolutely fantastic. It was very helpful, knowledgeable and passionate about their products. It was great!",5,2015,10,15
120,Best hotel in London,"The hotel just opened a week ago and it looks exactly as the photographs on the website do we didn't bother posting any of our own.  The hotel is excellent and surpassed all our expectations. The service staff (every one of them we've come across) from front desk, restaurant, concierge is very friendly, enthusiastic, knowledgeable, professional and made us feel perfectly at home. The Assistant Head Concierge, Mr Cowen, provided excellent information and recommendations on interesting places to visit and eat around the hotel. He is one of the best we've met. 
The room is fantastic. Cozy, comfortable and has everything you need. It is within short walking distance from Southwark tube station and has convenient supermarkets just downstairs. We highly recommend this wonderful hotel. And we will definitely be back again when we visit London next.",5,2015,10,15
120,Hilton Bankside,"Brand new hotel just behind Tate Modern.  Stayed for business a week after it opened, so everything was new and everyone trying hard.  Great location, great staff and thoroughly recommended, although got a deal which meant price was reduced by 25%.",5,2015,10,15
120,Fabulous,"Crucial Location, Amazing brand new property and staff willing to go beyond the extra mile :).  I was mostly impressed with the design of the hotel at the beggining of the stay and despite the hotel being open for just a few days, the staff was willing to go above and beyond to make my stay better.",5,2015,10,14
120,A wonderful new addition to the Hilton group in London.,"Stayed Friday night. The hotel has only been open a few days. Very modern and trendy inside; understated from the outside.  All staff were amazing - helpful, friendly and couldn't do enough for us. 
We used the lovely Executive Lounge, which has 3 'fires' burning (with steam instead of smoke) which is a focal point. Lovely cakes in the afternoon, and canapes in the evening. 
The Oxbo restaurant is very modern. Lots of art on the walls to look at. Great Ribeye steak for a main course.  
Lovely breakfast in the same restaurant, with a totally different vibe.  Ask for the fresh pancakes. Delicious.",5,2015,10,11
120,"A very pleasant, hassle free stay - service and quality both perfect!","Had a really great stay at the Hilton Bankside, the hotel is presented beautifully and the service really is first class. 

The hotel is a short walk from Southwark station and easy to locate.

When I arrived they already had my check in details to hand and I was escorted to my room despite having a piece of light luggage I was asked 2/3 times if I needed help. I was given a little tour of my room by a kind lady called Pattrawana who look after me throughout my stay. Little things really stood out for example they answer the phone quickly and. if staff see you struggling with something they come and see you straightaway.

The room itself was lovely - I didn't take any  pictures but the ones on their website is a fair representation of the rooms. As a gold member I was given an upgrade to a King Deluxe which was spacious, clean with contemporary decor.

I was offered breakfast in either the exec lounge or OXBO restaurant, I ate at the restaurant and was most impressed - they have the widest selection of breakfast options I have ever seen and the restaurant itself is very nice - I had an omelette made to order which was delicious . The restaurant staff were extremely attentive and like staff in the rest of the hotel they looked like they wanted to be there and enjoyed taking care of their guests.

Overall one of my best stays at a Hilton Hotel - I have already booked to stay again!",5,2015,10,11
120,Terrific,"Exceptionally good service, the staff in the executive lounge are very polite, considerate and courteous, they are on the move. All requests were fulfilled immediately. We felt very comfortable. Thank you Terence for your service.",5,2024,06,09
120,Simply recommendable,Staff very courteous and great service.... Food and drinks are in the right proportions and everything is absolutely perfect. You are greeted with a glass of champagne and they keep asking if everything is OK and OK. Simply very good,5,2024,06,06
120,Modern and central,"I was in London for 5 days with my son and the Hilton chain hotels are always a guarantee, a new and modern structure. At the reception all young people were willing and available. The breakfast buffet was quite varied, especially for those who love a savory breakfast in the morning. The only flaw is the half board (we had dinner included), dedicated menu with limited and repetitive choice. I would go back but only with breakfast.",4,2024,05,02
120,Great,"With my family we participated in the ""Bottomless Brunch"" we had the opportunity to enjoy good food in a very relaxed but at the same time very elegant atmosphere. The staff were very helpful and professional in explaining to us how the food we were eating was prepared. Finally, as it was the anniversary of our wedding, I and my wife were offered a birthday cake. They were very nice.

Anthony",5,2024,04,24
120,The beautiful experience with Mursal and Jefferson,"My experience at the Hotel was made unforgettable thanks to the exceptional hospitality of Jefferson and Mursal. As soon as we arrived, Mursal kindly offered to help us with our bags, making us feel immediately at ease.
Jefferson's contribution was equally valuable. In addition to assisting with check-in in an efficient and friendly manner, he provided us with valuable information on what to do and see in London. His recommendations were impeccable and greatly enriched our experience in the city.
Thanks to Jefferson and Mursal, our stay at the Hotel was more than just an overnight stay: it was a genuinely welcoming and enriching experience. I can't wait to return and enjoy their thoughtful hospitality once again.",4,2024,03,12
120,Very pleasant,"Highly recommended if you are staying at the Hilton Bankside.
Very courteous service, very good quality of food. Pleasantly quiet atmosphere. Attentive and professional staff. The extra cost is worth it! We will be back",5,2024,01,05
120,A hotel that impresses in every respect….,"The hotel is characterized by a very good location and exceptionally friendly service - everything is furnished in a contemporary and modern style; the rooms lack nothing - enough space, beautiful bathrooms and very good beds ensure great satisfaction. The breakfast buffet leaves nothing to be desired and is one of the best of all the Hilton hotels we have visited. But in the end, the very friendly and courteous staff in the service, at the reception and the concierge are great - we will be back!",4,2023,10,02
120,NIENTE MALE !,"Sito in buona  e strategica posizione ( centrale , vicino rispetto alla maggior parte delle più importanti locations )

120,Ottima Struttura moderna,Ottimo hotel dal buon design moderno. Ha una buona posizione a soli 5 minuti a piedi dalla Jubilee line. Bellissima l'executive lounge con tanta varieta' di drinks. La sala colazione e' molto spaziosa e la varieta' e qualita' del cibo e' molto buona. La camera e' molto spaziosa e specialmente la doccia e' veramente top.

120,Giusto un po' di rumore bianco,"Questo bellissimo hotel si trova a quindici minuti a piedi dal mio ufficio quindi, quando mi capita di tornare a Londra, se in budget, lo prediligo molto. Stavolta mi sono fermato una sola notte e a parte dormire non ho approfittato di nessun servizio (nemmeno la colazione avendo mangiato troppo la sera prima).
La camera è spaziosa e bella, si vede che non è molto che l'hotel è stato ristrutturato. Se devo trovare una pecca in camera si sentiva un ronzio fastidioso anche con l'impianto di riscaldamento spento. Per fortuna la notte ha smesso e non mi ha creato problemi a dormire.",5,2022,02,27
120,Das Hotel werde ich nicht mehr buchen,"Dadurch das man kein Fenster im Zimmer öffnen kann ist es ein no go!!!

Die Bar lädt zum Verweilen ein. Bei sanfter Musik ein Drink, bevor man in die Stadt hinaus flattert - warum nicht? Links und rechts plätschern die Gespräche der anderen Gäste in Arabisch, Chinesisch oder Amerikanischem Englisch und du atmest durch. Fehlt nur noch Scott Fitzgerald, der mit Zelda am Arm plötzlich an Deinen Tisch steht und sich zum Plaudern dazu setzt. 
Der Service ist makellos. Wir kommen wieder.",5,2021,05,24

120,Una prima impressione eccellente confermata per tutto il soggiorno,"In comodissima zona per l'ufficio ho soggiornato in questo hotel per 4 notti. L'hotel già entrando fa un'ottima impressione di modernità e benessere, con degli ambienti comuni molto curati e ricercati.
La camera che mi hanno dato, al terzo piano, è molto grande soprattutto se considero gli standard di Londra dove gli spazi sono solitamente ridotti all'osso.
Ingresso con ampio bagno con una enorme doccia a parete, camera con letto king dotata di moquette. Vista sul cortile interno che assicura una pace ed una quiete eccezionale (non si sentono rumori esterni ma nemmeno gli impianti di condizionamento).
Per la camera non so proprio cosa avrei potuto chiedere di più.
Colazione al ristorante con una discreta varietà di scelte dolci più la classica colazione all'inglese.
Colazione nella lounge meno fornita del ristorante ma comunque con tutto quello di cui avevo bisogno per fare una bella colazione. Lounge tra l'altro bellissima anche solamente da visitare.",5,2020,01,26

Servicepersonal war überall vorbildlich.

The staff was so friendly and helpful, the room was clean, breakfast was awesome and the breakfast room so comfortable! Absolutely recommendable. 

Das Hotel ist spitze! Traumhafte Lage, toller Pool zum Erholen, das Frühstück war mega, super schön angerichtet mit tollem und extrem vielen frisch zubereiteten Sachen auch auf Anfrage, Zimmer sauber und das Personal war überaus freundlich.

120,Muy caro y no lo vale,"Relación precio calidad no lo vale. Pagamos más de 430 libras la noche (más de 1.300 libras por solo 3 noches) y no hay chance en este ni en el próximo mundo de que este hotel y mucho menos la habitación que me dieron (la 111) valga esta cantidad de dinero. Lo más triste es que lo compre por la app del Hilton esperando obtener algún beneficio y creo que lo pagué más caro que en ningún lado. Lo increíble que a la mañana me cobraron además el desayuno de lo que ya me debitaron de la tarjeta por solo la habitación que dicho sea de paso no tiene ni una ventilación para que entre aire natural. Es un encierro total.

Abbiamo mangiato anche al ristorante a cena: buona la carne, scarse le porzioni del pesce. La colazione è “commovente”: c’è ogni ben di Dio, dolce e salato. Camere pulite ma non gli do la quinta stella perché su 3 notti di soggiorno per due volte siamo rientrati (stanchi) tra le 15 e le 16 e le stanze non erano rifatte!

120,Excelente estadía,"Hotel con muchas comodidades y muy bien ubicado. Las habitaciones eran grandes y 
agradables. La estancia fue muy cómoda, así también los desayunos buffet fueron muy ricos. La atención por parte de Juan Vásquez en el sector del buffet fue espectacular, siempre atento y preocupado de las personas.",5,2019,05,21
120,Un gran hotel,"Nos quedamos una noche y la verdad, es que todo estuvo fenomenal. Es un hotel bastante céntrico y bien comunicado. La habitacion era amplia y la cama muy cómoda. El desayuno era muy completo y el personal super amable. El bar que tiene para tomar algo, tambien lo recomiendo. En general la estancia fue de de10! ",5,2019,05,07
120,"Schön, zentral aber kleine Mängel bei der Sauberkeit","Wir waren über Ostern für 4 Tage im Hilton Bankside. 
Die Lage ist super, sehr zentral und trotzdem ruhig. Es sind Max. 5 Gehminuten zur nächsten U-Bahn Station (Southwark) und das Hotel liegt direkt hinter dem Tate Modern und somit nur 2 Minuten bis zur Themse. 
In der Umgebung sind mehrere gute Restaurants (zb Wagamama) und 3 Supermärkte. 
Zur St. Pauls Cathedral läuft man ca. 10 Minuten und zum Borough Food Market sind es ca. 15 Minuten und dieser ist auf jeden Fall ein Besuch wert :)

Wir hatten ein sehr schönes Zimmer (704) im 7. Stock mit schönem Ausblick und toller Größe. Das Bett war super bequem, das Zimmer hatte einen Kühlschrank und genügend Stauraum. 
Das Bad hatte eine tolle Größe und war schön ausgestattet, leider muss ich wegen der Sauberkeit aber einen dicken Punkt abziehen:(
Von der An- bis Abreise lagen neben und hinter der Toilette dunkle lange Haare am Boden... ich bin blond, mein Mann trägt Glatze, also nicht von uns!
Die selben Haare lagen auch im Abfluss in der Dusche. Der Duschkopf war verkalkt und wurde während der 4 Tage auch nicht gereinigt. 
Die Sauberkeit im restlichen Zimmer war gut. 
Leider gibt es im Badezimmer auch keine Möglichkeit die Haare zu föhnen, da es keinen Anschluss gibt, außerdem sollte dringend eine Klobürste „nachgerüstet“ werden!

Sonst gibt es nur positive Dinge zu berichten, der Empfang war sehr freundlich und obwohl wir bereits um 10:30 Uhr angereist sind, konnten wir gleich ein Zimmer beziehen. Das Frühstück war gut und abwechslungsreich, hier sollte wirklich jeder was finden. :)
Ganz besonders süß fanden wir die Candy-Bar im Eingangsbereich vom Hotel, tolle Idee! 

Das Restaurant, die Bar und den Pool haben wir nicht getestet.

Trotz der Defizite im Bereich der Sauberkeit würden wir das Hotel nochmal buchen, da die Lage einfach super ist. ",4,2019,04,25
120,Grundsätzlich ein sehr gutes Hotel,"Jedenfalls mit Zugang zur Businesslounch, aber nicht die Businesszimmer buchen! Die sind alle in den Innenhof und nicht besonders ansprechend gestaltet. Sonst passt alles. Nettes und sehr höffliches Personal.",5,2019,04,13
120,Super Hotel ,"Das Frühstück lässt keine Wünsche offen. Super lecker. Die Zimmer sind schön und geräumig und sehr sauber. Die Mitarbeiter sind zu jederzeit darum bemüht, dass man sich wohlfühlen. Und das ganze zu einem vernünftigen Preis. Wir kommen sicher wieder. ",5,2019,04,08
120,London Trip,"Das Hotel hat eine sehr gute Lage und bietet ein guten Frühstück um gut in den Tag zu starten, Kaffe ist top,
gleich in der Nähe befinden sich die Tube Stationen
es ist nicht weit von der Tower Bridge",5,2019,04,08
120,Simply the best,"Tutto perfetto!un servizio eccezionale, attento e curato.
Un team giovane che sa lavorare.
La lounge è stellare, le camere hanno un comfort estremo.
Letti comodissimi, silenzio e pace a 2 passi dal centro.

120,Ausgezeichnet,Perfekte Unterkunft sehr schönes Zimmer und Sauber Personal sehr zuvorkommend Frühstücksbufette sehr reichhaltig und frisch auch das Hallenbad hat uns sehr zu gesagt der Weg zur Tube war nur 5 Minuten perfekt gelegen ,5,2019,03,11
120,Absurda e innecesariamente caro,"Viaje de negocios con gala nocturna para un evento internacional. Tres noches, 700 libras, precio con descuento. La habitación era grande, pero no inmensa. La cama cómoda, pero sin excesos. El aseo sin bañera ni bidé. El precio no incluye desayuno, que cuesta 25 libras más por día y persona. Estaba incluido el gasto del mini bar, que solo tenía agua. Lo único verdaderamente excepcional es la ubicación, pero hay otro hotel por más de la mitad de precio a 50 metros.
Este tipo de hoteles venden lujo por encima de la media. Creo que no es porque en realidad lo ofrezcan, porque todo es correcto sin más. Es porque algunos a veces se lo compramos. Nunca más voy a un hotel así en un país civilizado.",3,2019,03,07
120,No merece la pena,"El alojamiento está muy bien situado entre las estaciones de Southwark y London Bridge, muy cerca del museo Tate.
Las habitaciones son de buen tamaño. La cama es cómoda, aunque no es la mejor en la que haya dormido en un hotel
El personal del hotel es muy amable y servicial.
Por lo demás, creo que es un establecimiento sobrevalorado, la relación calidad-precio no es buena, ya que es caro para lo que ofrece. La cama es buena, pero no excepcional. Además, la alarma sonó a las 4 a.m. y ya no pudimos dormirnos. No nos dieron ninguna explicación convincente. La wifi no va muy bien.

El desayuno es bueno, pero muy caro.",3,2019,03,06
120,Das Hotel !!! auf der Bankside,"Das Hilton London Bankside ist schon seit Jahren meine erste Wahl, wenn ich nach London komme. Das Tate Modern und die St Pauls Kathedrale sind nur einige Gehminuten entfernt. Weiter weg sind das Tower of London und die Tower Bridge. Wenn man als Tourist nach London kommt eignet sich dieses Hotel wunderbar als geeignete Bleibe, wenn man ein paar Tage mit seiner Familie verbringen möchte. Besonders gefallen hat mir die hiesige Bar, die mich an die Anfänge der 30er Jahre erinnert. Im Vordergrund stehen hier zahlreiche Gin Sorten, die je nach Geschmack des Kunden neu kreiert werden. Ein Cocktail auf den Gast persönlich abgestimmt. Angeblich gibt es auch Gin & Cocktail Schulungen, was ich definitiv demnächst ausprobieren möchte. Was auch auf meiner To Do Liste steht ist das Ausprobieren der neuen Vegan Suite. Diese wurde vor Kurzem in dem Hilton London Bankside eingerichtet und scheint auch ein voller Erfolg zu sein. 
Überhaupt liebe ich dieses Hotel auch, weil es sich so sehr in die Umgebung von Southwark einbindet. Sei es architektonisch, wie auch vom inneren Design. Man findet dort ein Ausschnitt der Fassade eines früheren Teehauses, alte Kachel, die beim U-Bahnbau verwendet wurden usw. Alles in allem ein Konzept was aufgegangen ist und Gäste wie mich weiterhin anziehen wird.",5,2019,03,03
120,Weekend romantico Londra,"Ci siamo trovati benissimo,ci hanno coccolato dall'inizio alla fine del nostro soggiorno,

Pulizia eccellente,ottima colazione ,molto assortita,
Piscina e servizi Spa top.",5,2019,02,19
120,Gute Lage ... konsequente Gestaltung,"Lage ist natürlich klasse, sehr ruhig, bestens angebunden ... 
Angenehme Hotelgröße.
Ein riesiges Plus: die liebenswerten Menschen im Service! Aus aller Damen und Herren Länder und sehr aufmerksam und freundlich. Mein Mann hatte sich fies mit dem Brotmesser in den Finger geschnitten und wurde bestens und unaufgeregt vom Kellner verarztet. 
Wirklich schönes Frühstücks-Buffet! Als eher vegetarisch und glutenfrei orientierter Mensch habe ich eine große Auswahl vorgefunden.
Zimmer: Wie so häufig viiiiel zu wenig Möglichkeiten, Handtücher aufzuhängen; ich werde das nie begreifen. Dusche in der Badewanne, ohne Vorhang oder dgl., so dass man nicht umhin kam, das Badezimmer zu fluten. Im Flur gab es ein penetrantes grünes Deckenlicht, das sich nicht ausschalten ließ. Wir erfuhren, dass unser Zimmer behindertengerecht ausgestattet war, und das Licht eine Alarmvorrichtung für hörbehinderte/gehörlose Menschen ist. Uns wurde ein anderes Zimmer angeboten - vielleicht ist das Thema ""Handtuchhalter"" in anderen Räumen ja anders gelöst...  Wir haben das grelle Licht für die zweite Nacht überklebt. 
Angenehmes Bett.
Das ""Styling"" ist Geschmackssache ... dunkel gehalten mit ""ironischen Details"" ... durchaus nicht ungemütlich...",4,2019,02,11
120,"Piccolo Hotel, ma con tutti confort","Hotel di buon livello, anche se un po' decentrato. Arredamento moderno con spunti di originalità e con alcuni comfort di qualità. Unica pecca, i bambini all'interno della lounge che creano solo confusione.",4,2019,02,06
120,Sehr gute Lage,"Dieses Hotel ist von seiner Lage und von der Umgebung sehr zu empfehlen, man hat die UBahn in der Nähe und man ist zu Fuß auch sehr schnell z.B. Beim London Eye! Das Hotel hat ein wunderbares Frühstück, sehr, sehr freundliches, hilfsbereites Personal, schöne Zimmer, schönes Bad! Eigentlich alles, was man braucht! Für London fast unglaublich, ich kenne es normal nicht so!",5,2019,01,15

120,Excelente!! Ahora es nuestro favorito para visitar Londres.,"Desde la llegada el personal fue super amable, muy lindo y agradable el hotel. 
La habitación muy amplia y bastante limpia, lo único es que la cama nos pareció un poco incómoda. El desayuno muy bueno, con muy buena calidad de productos.
La ubicación del hotel es fantástica.
Seguro regresaremos pronto.",5,2019,01,08
120,"Sehr schön, aber nicht perfekt","Wir haben in diesem Hotel für unseren fünftägigen Städtetrip durch London einen Executive Room gebucht.
Das Zimmer ist groß, verschenkt jedoch Platz durch den Schreibtisch-bereich, der hinterm Bett gelegen ist (das Kopfteil des Bettes fungiert als Raumteiler). Dieser hintere Bereich wirkt dunkel, ist nicht sehr einladend und verschenkt viel Platz.
Sollte man hier wirklich arbeiten wollen, sieht das Ganze mit Sicherheit natürlich anders aus.
An den Betten und im gesamten Raum sind an vielen Orten Steckdosen platziert, was viele Hotels leider immer noch nicht schaffen. Auch lässt sich die gesamte Beleuchtung des Zimmers vom Bett aus steuern. Klasse!
Das Bett selbst ist in Ordnung, wie haben jedoch in anderen 5 Sterne Hotels bereits bedeutend besser geschlafen. Hinweis an Allergiker: Das Hotel verwendet noch Daunenbettwäsche! Das ist sicher vom hygienischem Standpunkt aus nicht mehr zeitgemäß.
Im sehr großen Badezimmer finden sich eine separate Dusche und eine Badewanne. Ich konnte in jeder Ecke schauen und habe nirgendwo Schimmel oder ähnliches gefunden.
Die Reinlichkeit ist wirklich herausragend! Selten hatte ich so wenig bedenken auf Socken oder gar barfuß durch das Zimmer zu laufen. 
Zu erwähnen sei auch noch die Minibar, die zwar nicht mit klassischen Getränken wie Cola oder Chips gefüllt ist (hier wird der Ansatz ""healthy food"" vertreten), die Getränke haben uns aber allesamt sehr positiv überrascht. Alles (wirklich alles) aus der Minibar kostet keinen Aufpreis und wird täglich aufgefüllt. Das habe ich so noch nicht erlebt und ist wirklich klasse!
Das Frühstück ist sehr gut. Die Auswahl ist groß und lässt keine Wünsche offen. Zusammen mit der Buchung des Executive Rooms / Suiten etc. erhält man Zugang zur Business Lounge. Wahlweise kann man sich aussuchen, ob man im Restaurant frühstücken möchte, oder die kleinere (und wesentlich ruhigere) Lounge bevorzugt.
Die Lounge hat übrigens von 06:30 - 22:00 Uhr geöffnet und es werden in dieser Zeit Getränke und Snacks angeboten (inklusive). Das Ganze lässt sich ganz gut mit einer abgespeckten Variante einer Business-Lounge am Flughafen vergleichen.
Auch ist das WLAN im ganzen Hotel ausreichend schnell und ohne Aufpreis 24/7 nutzbar.
Zu guter Letzt sei noch die tolle Lage des Hotels erwähnt: In wenigen Minuten ist man an der Milleniums-Bridge oder an der U-Bahn Station ""Blackfriars"". Nur wenige Meter vom Hotel entfernt befindet sich auch ein kleiner Coop, der bis 23:00 Uhr geöffnet hat.
Grundsätzlich ist die akustische Dämmung zu den anderen Zimmern sehr gut, leider fallen jedoch die Türen so laut in die Schlösser, dass wir davon sehr oft geweckt wurden (das liegt nicht an rücksichtslosen Gästen, sondern an der Türmechanik selbst).
Die Belüftungsanlage (Klima / Heizung) ist eher mau. 24 °C eingestellt fühlen sich wie 20 °C oder kälter an. Bis wir das verstanden haben, haben wir öfter gefroren. 
Im Badezimmer befindet sich weder ein Heizkörper, noch Fußbodenheizung. Das Bad ist dadurch immer sehr kalt und leider etwas ungemütlich.
Auch ist die Belüftung im Badezimmer quasi nicht vorhanden. Handtücher werden über den Tag nur selten trocken und auch Gerüche halten sich lange.
Der zur Verfügung gestellte Heißluftfön lässt sich nicht im Badezimmer nutzen (im Bad befindet sich nur eine Steckdose für Rasierer). Um die Haare zu fönen muss man also eine der Steckdosen in der Nähe des Bettes nutzen. Das ist wirklich nervig, da kein Spiegel zur Verfügung steht.
Es existiert keine Garderobe im Eingangsbereich und nur ein Stuhl im Zimmer (vom Schreibtischstuhl in der dunklen Ecke hinterm Bett einmal abgesehen). Unsere Winterjacken landetet also die meiste Zeit auf dem Boden. Das muss wirklich nicht sein!
Das Personal war durchweg sehr professionell und freundlich.
Ich würde gerne fünf Sterne geben, jedoch sind die Negativpunkte für uns zu gravierend. Besonders die lauten Türen haben uns viele Stunden Schlaf gekostet und uns morgens des öfteren geweckt.
Trotz allem ist das Hotel empfehlenswert. Wir würden uns, bei den Preisen, jedoch sicher bei unserem nächsten Städtetrip durch London für ein anderes Hotel begeistern.",4,2019,01,03
120,Eine schöne Weihnachtszeit im Hilton,"Eind empfehlenswertes Hotel für London-Aufenthalt. Ruhige Lage, obwohl Zentrumsnähe (direkt bei Tate Modern) und ca. 20 min zu Fuß bis Tower Bridge (schöner Spazierweg entlang der Themse). Das Frühstück war sehr gut und am 25. Dezember wurden wir mit einem Geschenkstiefel an der Zimmertür überrascht:)) das war sehr lieb:)",5,2018,12,28
120,Muy bueno!!!!Muy bien ubicado!!!!,"El Hotel Hilton es uno de los mejores que he estado. Su diseño es muy acorde con el barrio donde está tipo industrial. El desayuno es impresionante, y el servicio también es muy bueno en todos los puntos, y también en la recepción. Es un Hotel que calidad precio, vale la pena, está muy bien situado. Muy recomendable el Market que hay cerca del Hotel para comer.",5,2018,11,25

120,Excelente Servicio ,"Es un hotel 5 estrellas, muy cómodo y completo:
Está muy bien ubicado muy cerca de la estación Southwark del metro (tube) y del tren (estación Blackfriars) de la línea Thameslink que es la que otorga el servicio directo desde St Pancras.
Muy buen acceso si ustedes quieren caminar desde las estaciones para ahorrar el taxi desde St Pancras o desde los aeropuertos ya que ambas estaciones tienen ascensores.
Respecto a la habitación grande con 2 armarios (cosa rara en Londres)
El desayuno (mi favorito) mucha variedad y con cosas que nosotros (los latinos) comemos.
Desde el portero hasta las niñas de aseo todos se portaron increíbles con nosotras. Como celebrábamos nuestro aniversario de matrimonio incluso de bienvenida nos tenían un hermoso trozo de pastel.
Nada malo que decir de este hotel y seguramente se volvió mi hotel favorito de Londres y cuando vuelva volveré a hospedarme con ellos.",5,2018,10,31

120,Top-Hotel in sehr guter Lage,"Wir hatten einen tollen Aufenthalt während unserer Englandrundreise in diesem Hotel. Die Lage ist sehr gut, da man viele Sehenswürdigkeiten direkt zu Fuß erreichen kann. Bus- und U-Bahnstation (Southwark) sind aber auch ganz in der Nähe. Das Hotel ist noch ziemlich neu und hat sehr schöne, moderne Zimmer. Das Bett war sehr bequem und Bad sowie Dusche geräumig. Manche Zimmer gehen in einen Innenhof und somit haben die unteren Stockwerke vermutlich weniger Tageslicht bzw. keine Aussicht. Darum würde ich ein Zimmer ab dem 6. Stock oder zur Straßenseite empfehlen. Das Frühstück bietet eine sehr große Auswahl und lässt keine Wünsche offen. Individuelle Omelettes und Pancakes werden für jeden Gast auf Wunsch zubereitet. Das Personal war insgesamt sehr freundlich, besonders Dylan H. hat beim Frühstück immer gute Laune verbreitet, war sehr hilfsbreit und zuvorkommend. Auch John K., der Chef-Concierge, hat uns mit seiner herzlichen und professionellen Art empfangen und war sehr beliebt bei unserem Sohn (Thank you again! :-)).
Der Pool war sehr modern, sauber und immerhin 17m lang mit integriertem Sitzbereich mit Düsen. Leider im Untergeschoss und relativ dunkel, aber man liegt ja im Hotel in London auch nicht den ganzen Tag am Pool. Für uns war es in Ordnung. Das Essen in der Bar war ebenfalls schmackhaft und der Service dort sehr nett. Wir würden auf jeden Fall wieder in dieses Hotel gehen.",5,2018,08,23

La zona perfecta, cercana al Tate Modern, medios de comunicación, restaurantes, bares. En fin todo lo necesario.",5,2018,08,21
120,Dalle stelle alle stalle,Mi dispiace ma non sono stato avvisato che le camere comunicanti ne non erano disponibili. Poi non sono stato avvisato che al mio arrivo avrei dovuto anticipare 300 sterline sul conto per eventuali extra. Poi non so perché non mi trovo la colazione compresa..ma forse questo è un mio problema con Booking. Il frigo bar è vuoto!!!!!!!!!,2,2018,08,20
120,Excelente hotel,"Iniciamos con la ubicación la cual es excelente. Muy cerca la estaciones  South Wark dy Waterllo, del metro. Al lado del Tate, del Globe,, se puede ir caminando a la catedral de San Paul a través del Millienum bridge, a unos 15-20 min caminando del Shard, y de London Bridge.  Las habitaciones impecables, para destacar en la la recepción (Jefferson Camacho), los concierge (Especialmente Mark), en el restaurante a Juan Vasquez y Alejandro Gil, cuando se enteran que eres latino se esfuerzan aun mas por atenderte bien. En relación costo beneficio vale mucho la pena
Tiene un bar espectacular con mas de 30 ginebras diferentes

120,"Einwandfreier Aufenthalt in zentaler, aber ruhiger Gegend","Das Hotel ist mit öffntlichen Verkehrsmitteln gut erreichbar. Das Personal ist sehr freundlich und flexibel - unsere Wünsche bzgl. des check-in wurden anstandslos berücksichtigt. Das Zimmer selbst war geräumig, sauber und angenehm. Wir haben nur nicht herausgefunden, wie die Beleuchtung funktioniert. Einmal war es nicht möglich, das Licht im Bad gesondert zu aktivieren, dann ging es plötzlich. Bett sehr bequem, genug Ablagefläche und usb Steckplätze neben den Steckdosen. 
Der einzige Kritikpunkt: wir waren jeweils am späten Nachmittag für einen kurzen Boxenstopp im Hotel. Genau dann kam die Dame vom Roomservice rein, ohne vorher anzuklopfen. Nicht so toll, wenn einer gerade duscht und sich der andere gerade umzieht. Ansonsten hat aber alles gepasst. Frühstück haben wir nicht gehabt, da es im Hotel viel zu teuer ist. Gleich neben dem Hotel sind ein Costa Coffee und drei Supermärkte. Die Straße rauf sind etliche Lokale, es gibt also mehr als genug Alternativen.",5,2018,05,21

120,Abzocke im Wechselkurs am Hilton Geldautomaten,"Bei Ankunft wurde uns der Geldautomat des Hotels von der Rezeption empfohlen. Wir sagten, dass wir extra nicht am Flughafen Geld gewechselt haben, da dort die Wechselkurse manipuliert werden. Der Hilton Automat hat uns dann für das Abheben von 300GBP einen Wechselkurs gegeben, welcher über 10% !!! über dem aktuellen Kurs liegt. Das entsprach Kosten von 45 EUR für das abheben von 300 Pfund!!! Pure Abzocke und das trotz dessen wir extra auf dieses Problem am Flughafen hingewiesen haben, macht Hilton es genauso!",1,2018,04,19
120,Favoloso,"Abbiamo soggiornato qui due notti per un weekend londinese e ci siamo trovati benissimo. L'hotel si presenta con una hall stupenda che rispecchia lo stile architettonico del quartiere. Alla reception sorrisi e cordialità non mancano, disponibili a qualsiasi chiarimento. Da non perdere un cocktail meraviglioso nel bar posto proprio all'interno dell'hotel. Pulitissimo, accappatoio e asciugamani in abbondanza. Stanza spaziosa, così come il bagno e la bellissima doccia. Silenziosissimo, nessun rumore entrava dall'esterno e nemmeno dalle stanze confinanti.  Eccellente il servizio in camera....a mezzanotte in poco tempo sono arrivati i due hamburger (buonissimi) che avevamo ordinato poco prima. Non abbiamo visitato la piscina, quindi dovremo tornare. 5 minuti a piedi dalla metropolitana, vicinissimo al Borought Market e al Tamigi. Prezzo non economico ma li vale tutti. Consigliatissimo.",5,2018,03,07
120,Sehr empfehlenswertes Hotel,"Ich habe das Hotel mit meinem Freund zu seinem Geburtstag besucht und war echt begeistert. Der Service ist sehr gut und ein kleiner Kuchen wurde vom Hotel selbst arrangiert nachdem ich eine kleine Nachricht hinterlassen habe! 
Der Pool war ein Traum. 
Das Frühstück war auch sehr gut und hatte eine breite Auswahl, frische Pancakes und frisch gepressten Orangensaft, große Auswahl an Backwaren, könnte aber im Allgemeinen im Geschmack noch etwas punkten, aber das ist nur ein kleiner Punkt.
Die Wasserfall Dusche war gut, aber nicht ganz dicht an den Seiten und der Strahl war auch nicht mehr so stark. Dennoch gutes Duschgefühl und sehr geräumiger Duschbereich. Es gab ubringens auch einen normalen abnehmbaren Duschkopf mit stärkerem Strahl.
Ich hatte einen Lockenstab dabei mit englischem Stecker, musste aber feststellen, dass im Badezimmer der normale deutsche Stecker nur zur Verfügung stand. Das Hotelpersonal konnte leider auch keinen zur Verfügung stellen. Das also beachten, falls ihr denkt das Badartikel mit englischem Stecker in Ordnung sind. :)

Das Hotel ist alles in allem Business angehaucht, aber dennoch gut für alle anderen Anlässe. Ich empfehle es gerne weiter.

120,sehr schönes Hotel in perfekter Lage,Vorab: kein Hotel in London liegt aus meiner Sicht für alles optimal. Das Hilton liegt aber aus meiner Sicht gut da man von southwark mit der metro in 4 Stationen mitten in der Stadt ( bondstreet ) ist und trotzdem Ziele wie Tower bridge und Borough Market direkt vor der Tür hat. Das Hotel entspricht von Ausstattung und Service dem was ich von einem 5 Sterne Hotel erwarte. Sehr schöne Zimmer und eine schöne Einrichtung mit allem was am braucht. Sauberkeit ist bei einem solchen Hotel selbstverständlich und es gab einen sehr netten Bettaufschlagservice bei dem auch die Handtücher nochmals gewechselt wurden. Ich war zu ersten Mal da aber sicher nicht zum letzen Mal ! Das Frühstückbuffet ist TOP und auch fühlt man sich rundum umsorgt. Hervorzuheben war die nette Weihnachtsdeko und am Nachmittag gab es in der Hotelhalle 4 Sänger die Weihnachtslieder gesungen haben. Dazu gab es kostenlosen Glühwein und Plätzchen. Nette Geste ! Preislich ist das Hotel meiner Meinung nach OK und hat ein gutes Preis / Leistungsverhältnis ! Der Pool war schön und es war an den 2 Tagen nichts los. Wir kommen gerne wieder !,5,2018,01,07

Le camere sono comode e dotate di ogni comfort, il tutto molto pulito. La colazione inclusa è di altissimo livello con prodotti che possono soddisfare ogni esigenza e golosità. Certamente raccomandabile!",5,2017,12,05
120,Genial für einen Städtetrip,"Wir haben zum zweiten Mal ein verlängertes Wochenende im Hotel Hilton Bankside verbracht. Uns überzeugte die zentrale Lage (U-Bahnstation Southwark, Borough Market liegen in Gehdistanz), das grosszügige Zimmer sowie das geniale Frühstücksbuffet! Zudem verfügt das Hotel über einen Indoor Swimmingpool von beeindruckender Länger, was für ein Stadthotel eher selten ist!
Wir kommen sicher wieder! ",5,2017,11,16
120,Notevole,Ottima struttura. Posizione eccezionale. Personale gentilissimo. Assistenza in tutte le lingue. Stanze insonorizzate e ben fornite di prodotti. Acqua te e caffè a disposizione gratuitamente. La Tube è a 5 minuti a piedi. Stazione Blackfriers strategica per i collegamenti ,5,2017,11,12
120,Erste Klasse!!!,"Das Hotel würde uns im Zuge einer NFL-Reise zugewiesen. Von alleine wären wir niemals darauf gekommen, in einem 5-Sterne-Hotel zu nächtigen, aber es war wirklich ein tolles Erlebnis! Vor allem das riesige Bett und die tolle Dusche mit Regenschauer-Duschkopf haben uns beeindruckt. Da wir ohnehin den ganzen Tag unterwegs waren, hat uns die Aussicht auf die gegenüberliegende Hauswand nicht gestört. Das Frühstück ist sehr umfangreich und vielfältig. Gefreut hat uns der frisch gepresste Orangensaft (ich kann diese ganzen Konzentrate nicht mehr sehen....). Check-in und Check-Out gingen auch reibungslos. Das Zimmer war nach dem Roomservice immer 1a sauber und aufgeräumt.",5,2017,11,01
120,"Tolle, zentrale Unterkunft",Wir wohnten zum zweiten Mal in diesem Hilton Hotel und waren wieder sehr zufrieden. Die Angestellten sind durchwegs sehr freundlich und hilfsbereit. Die Zimmer und auch Badezimmer sind sehr grosszügig und modern eingerichtet. Die Betten sind sehr komfortabel. Das Frühstücksbuffet ist sehr köstlich und auch wie die allgemeinen Räume des Hotels sehr schön eingerichtet.,5,2017,10,29
120,"Modernes Hotel, in Zentraler Lage","Das Zimmer war von angemessener Größe, gepflegtes Badezimmer und für ein Innestadthotel sehr ruhig gelegen. Frühstück ohne Beanstandung, sehr viel Auswahl, Bioprodukte, freundliches Personal. Die Preise im Restaurant und Bar etwa überzogen (wie leider oft in London) als Alternarive viele Möglichkeiten in der nahen Umgebung.",4,2017,10,26
120,Dark Room in guter Lage,"Das Hotel hinterließ bei meiner Frau und mir für die Dauer unseres 6tägigen Aufenthalts in London einen uneinheitlichen Eindruck.

Die Lage des Hotels ist sehr gut, nur 5 Minuten bis zur U-Bahn oder zur Themse, in einer ruhig gelegenen Seitenstrasse. Es ist modern eingerichtet und gepflegt, das Frühstück zwar nicht luxuriös, aber durchaus dem Standard entsprechend.

Weniger gut war leider das Zimmer (246), ein Zimmer mit Blick in den Innenhof. Da es ein Eckzimmer war, hatte es nur eine halb so grosse Fensterseite wie die Nachbarzimmer und erleuchtete den Wohn/Schlafraum nur sehr spärlich von der Seite. Leider war der Raum auch noch dunkelanthrazit gestrichen, was zwar stylisch aussah, aber das bisschen Restlicht fast völlig schluckte - unser „dark room“. Rein subjektiv (leider hatte ich keinen Meter dabei) wirkte unser King Guest Room auch etwas kleiner als die genannten 30 qm. Dafür war es wohltuend ruhig.

Bett war gut, Fernseher u. WLAN funktionierten wunschgemäß, aber es gab zuwenig Stauraum.

Das Bad war okay, aber die Belüftung/Abzug war zu schwach und die Dusche war in einer Ecke der Badewanne, leider ohne Abtrennung, so dass man sehr vorsichtig sein musste, um das Bad nicht zu fluten.

Der Service im EG (Lobby, Empfang, Frühstücksraum) war sehr gut, aber das House Keeping der Zimmermädchen/Zimmerboys liess sehr zu wünschen übrig. Mal abendliches Bettaufdecken, dann wieder nicht, mal frische Waschlappen, dann wieder nicht etc.  Es wäre wünschenswert gewesen, wenn sich mal jemand um den verstopften Abfluß in der Badewanne gekümmert hätte. Auch soll es Hotels geben, bei denen die Zimmerdamen/herren beim morgentlichen Auf-dem-Gang-treffen die Gäste grüssen - was hier nicht ein einziges Mal passierte…

Ob wir wiederkämen? Aufgrund der guten Lage möglicherweise, aber dann nur für 3 oder 4 Nächte und in den teureren Executive Rooms mit grösseren Fenstern.",3,2017,10,01
120,"Ottimo Hotel.Nuovissimo.A due passi dal lungofiume ,dalla Cattedrale di Saint Paul e dalla Tate Modern.","Ottimo Hotel della catena Hilton, non grandissimo, quindi molto accogliente. Bella la Hall dallo stile moderno e ricercato
Belle le stanze, ottima la qualità del sonno e la climatizzazione

Veramente consigliato!",5,2017,09,27
120,Verlängertes Wochenende in London,"Das Hilton Bankside ist ein sehr schönes modernes Hotel mir viel Liebe zum Detail und einer interessanten modernen Einrichtung.
Das Personal war sehr freundlich und zuvorkommend, das Frühstück sehr abwechslungsreich, frisch und gut (man hat die Qual der Wahl zwischen mehreren frischen Säften, Broten, Gebäck, Obst, Müsli...). 
Uns hat leider nur gestört, dass die Zimmer etwas dunkel waren (trotz schöner indirekter Beleuchtung) und dass man kein Fenster öffnen konnte. Daher einen Stern weniger. 
Die Lage ist auch gut, ca.2 Minuten vom Tate Modern entfernt und ca.5 Minuten von der Millenium Bridge. 
Es gibt kleine Restaurants in Fußnähe wie z.B.einen italienischen Feinkostladen bei dem man sich es gut gehen lassen kann.",4,2017,09,14
120,Absolut perfekt,"Dieses Hilton hat uns rundum zufriedengestellt. Ein modernes, gepflegtes Haus zum Wohlfühlen. Alle Mitarbeiter von ausgesuchter Freundlichkeit und Hilfsbereitschaft.
Unsere Suite war mit großem Bad, separater Toilette,getrenntem Wohnraum, zwei großen Flachbild-TVs, bequemen Betten. Im Schlafzimmer  Fenster von Decke bis Boden, trotzdem kein Außengeräusch zu hören. Abends Abdeckservice, Alle Produkte der Minibar waren mit Ausnahme der Alkoholika kostenfrei und wurden täglich nachgefüllt. Mit Buchung der Suite war auch der Zugang zur Executive-Lounge inbegriffen, mit Frühstück, Häppchen, Getränken. Im Untergeschoß ein relativ großes Hallenbad (17 m Länge)  und Spa. Lage ausgezeichnet, direkt gegenüber die Tate Modern, in kurzer Gehweite Globe Theater, Borough-Market, Tower, Tower-Bridge, auch Westminster, Soho mit seinen Restaurants und Theatern etwa 30 Minuten zu Fuß. Wir haben uns schon lange nicht in einem Stadthotel so wohl gefühlt  und fanden das Preis/Leistungsverhältnis absolut angemessen.
Eine klare Empfehlung und für uns zum Wiederkommen.",5,2017,08,31
120,soggiorno splendido,"Soggiorno prenotato inizialmente dall'azienda per i giorni del training decido di chiedere un preventivo per il weekend. Ovviamente ho dovuto cambiare da Deluxe a Twin perché il mio budget era ovviamente ridotto, ma nessun cambiamento nella gentilezza del personale e nel confort della stanza, superlativo in entrambi i casi!
Colazione fantastica, e il servizio in camera davvero ""top"" e sinceramente per nulla caro!
Un grazie speciale ad Angelo e (se ricordo bene) Amin per aver reso tutto molto più' semplice e pieno di sorrisi.",5,2017,08,18
120,Wonderful!,"Albergo bellissimo, personale estremamente gentile e qualificato.

120,Sehr zufrieden,"Lage, Service, Sauberkeit ist wirklich hervorragend. Wir wurden sehr angenehm und freundlich empfangen und waren mit dem Aufenthalt zufrieden gewesen. Würden das Hotel jederzeit empfehlen. Vielen Dank ",5,2017,08,14
120,"Modernes, grosszügiges Hotel im Zentrum","Wir haben das Hilton Bankside wegen der hervorragenden Lage gewählt und wurden tatsächlich nicht enttäuscht. Wer vom Flughafen Heathrow mit der U-Bahn anreist hat zwar etwas länger, kommt dafür unkompliziert und günstig ans Ziel. Das Hotel liegt in einer ruhgen Seitenstrasse, was zu einem entspannten Schlaf verhilft. Empfehlenswert sind Zimmer in der oberen Etage. Die Zimmer sind sehr gross, was auch das Badezimmer betrifft. Ein Pluspunkt erhält die tolle Regendusche. Bademantel & Slipper werden ebenfalls zur Verfügung gestellt. Das Frühstück bietet auch eine grössere Auswahl an gesunden Speisen, was meiner Meinung nach in London eine Seltenheit ist. Check-In und Check-out verläuft sehr professionell, freundlich und in angemessener Zeit. Die Concierge leisten einen hervorragenden Service und schenken einem immer wieder ein neues Lächeln. ",5,2017,08,07
120,Wunderbarer Aufenthalt in zentraler Lage,"Wir haben eine wunderbare Woche im Hilton Bankside verbracht. Das Hotel liegt sehr zentral und trotzdem ruhig in einer Seitenstrasse. Unser Executive-Zimmer war ruhig gelegen, sehr großzügig geschnitten und modern eingerichtet. Besonders das Badezimmer mit seiner Regendusche und den großen Handtüchern empfanden wir als äußerst angenehm. Alle nicht alkoholischen Getränke in der Minibar waren inclusive. Das Frühstück war vielseitig, die Atmosphäre ruhig und die MitarbeiterInnen sehr aofmerksam. Ein prima Start in den Tag. Sehr empfehlenswert ist die Executive-Lounge mit ihrem großzügen Angebot an Speisen und Getränken. Insbesondere der Service ist zuvorkommend. Wir haben uns hier immer sehr wohl und willkommen gefühlt. Alle MitarbeiterInnen waren stets freundlich und profesionell. Wir würden immer mit einem Lächeln begrüßt. Gerne kommen wir wieder.",5,2017,08,06
120,Fabulous,"Un vero hotel a 5 stelle! Non come in Italia dove le 'stelle' vengono lanciate a caso.
Servizio e personale professionale e di classe.
Ottima la prima colazione ed anche il ristorante.
Ero per lavoro ma tornerei volentieri anche solo per un weekend.",5,2017,07,24
120,Tranquillo,"Albergo tranquillo e con un buon servizio. Da un 5 stelle ci si aspetterebbe forse qualcosa in più, ma il prezzo è probabilmente da 4 stelle per i parametri di Londra. La posizione è molto tranquilla, ma non vicinissima alle maggiori arterie del traffico pubblico, anche se a soli 5 min a piedi si trova una stazione della metropolitana.",3,2017,07,24
120,Tolles Hotel in super Lage,"Das Hotel liegt für Touristen optimal an der Themse (im Gebiet Bankside).
Sämtliche Sehenswürdigkeiten (Tower Bridge, London Bridge, London Eye, Westminster, ..) die an der Themse liegen können problemlos zu Fuß erreicht werden - das meiste davon in 10 Minuten. Wir konnten von dort aus sogar alles zu Fuß machen, eine bessere Lage hätten wir uns nicht vorstellen können. (Der Zug vom Flughafen hält direkt dort in der Nähe, sodass man ohne umsteigen oder teures Taxi das Hotel gut erreichen kann und es gibt auch eine Ubahnstation in unmittelbarer Nähe für alle die nicht laufen wollen).

Dazu kommt, dass das Hotel an sich auch wirklich zu empfehlen ist:

Die Zimmer sind modern und groß, das Bad ist der Wahnsinn - riesig, modern, einfach toll,

Der Service ist sehr freundlich und auch im Vorfeld, als bei uns einige Fragen aufgekommen sind, kamen sofort immer so nette eMails zurück und alle unsere Probleme wurden umgehend beseitigt. Bei Fragen zu Reservierungen stand man uns jederzeit an der Rezeption zur Verfügung. Fragen zur Erreichbarkeit des Hotels wurden uns im Vorfeld beantwortet,.. was auch immer wir auf dem Herzen hatten, uns wurde geholfen :)

Mein Mann hatte Geburtstag und bekam vom Hotel eine Überraschung aufs Zimmer gebracht.

Insgesamt ein tolles langes Wochenende und das beste Hotel das wir uns für unseren London-Touristen-Besuch vorstellen konnten, es war noch besser als wir uns das vorgestellt hatten. Super!",5,2017,07,12

120,"Super tolles Hotel, schöne und geräumige Zimmer, feines Essen","Das Hilton London Bankside ist eines der neueren Hotels der Stadt und befindet sich im Viertel Bankside nahe dem Tate Modern und der Themse. Das Hotel ist ideal um die Sehenswürdigkeiten entlang der Themse wie Westminster, Tower of London, Greenwich per Boot zu erkunden.

Das gesamte Personal das Hotels war wunderbar. Sehr freundlich und jederzeit hilfsbereit. Besser geht kaum.

Unsere Suite im 7. Stock war extrem geräumig, mit wunderschönem Wohnzimmer, Schlafzimmer und 2 Badezimmern. Von der Badewanne hatte man einen traumhaften Blick in Richtung Shard. Die Zimmer sind top ausgestattet und lassen keine Wünsche offen.Sogar die alkoholfreien Getränke aus der Minibar waren inkludiert.

Die Executive Lounge besticht durch ihre moderne und stilvolle Einrichtung. Sie bietet extrem viel Platz und eine große Auswahl an Getränken, wunderbare Snacks, Zeitungen und Internet.

Auch das OXBO Restaurant war ein Traum. Vom Frühstück bis zum Dinner alle Speisen schmeckten vorzüglich. Einzig und allein bei meinem Wagyu-Burger waren die Zwiebel so extrem dick geschnitten, dass dies schon ungenießbar war.

Wir kommen mit Sicherheit wieder!",5,2017,06,01
120,Neues Hotel in sehr guter Lage,"Das Hilton Bankside ist ein modernes Hotel in für Touristen sehr praktischer Lage: nur einen Häuserblock von der Tate Modern entfernt (und in diesem Block befinden sich einige Restaurants und ein Supermarkt - zwei weitere Supermärkte sind gleich neben dem Hotel, alle von 7 Uhr bis 23 Uhr täglich geöffnet). Man ist also in 5 Minuten zu Fuß an der Themse, von dort in weniger als 10 Minuten am Borough Market oder auf der anderen Flußseite bei der St. Paul's Cathedral. Die Southwark  Tube Station ist auch in 5 Minuten zu Fuß erreichbar. 
Wir hatten ein Twin Room gebucht, beim check-in haben wir freundlicherweise ein kostenfreies Upgrade auf ein Deluxe Zimmer bekommen (Zimmernr. 254), was uns freute, denn die ""normalen"" Twin Rooms haben nur Blick in den Innenhof. Die Zimmer sind tatsächlich größer als man es in London gewöhnt ist, im üblichen ""Hilton Chic"" mit dem unvermeidbaren Spannteppich. Aber alles sehr neu, sauber und sogar im Kühlschrank gibt es genügend Platz für eigene Einkäufe. Das Hotelpersonal war sehr freundlich und hat sich kompetent um die Gäste gekümmert, einzig das Housekeeping hatte ein paar kreative Einlagen, die nicht notwendig wären (A/C Temperatur auf 18 Grad runterdrehen, Zahnbürsten und Kosmetika im Bad sinnlos umräumen u.ä.). Alles in allem waren wir zufrieden und können das Hotel weiterempfehlen.",4,2017,06,01
120,Soggiorno a 5 stelle,"Abbiamo trascorso un lungo soggiorno di 9 notti in questo meraviglioso hotel dove sin dall’inizio ci hanno coccolati. 
Ottima e recente struttura ubicata a 2 minuti a piedi dalla stazione della metropolitana, in una zona molto tranquilla sulla riva sud del Tamigi. 
Le colazioni ottime, super abbondanti e con ampia scelta offrono cibi freddi e caldi con cuoco a disposizione per pancake, uova fritte, waffel.
Camera e bagno spaziosi e pulitissimi, dotati di ogni comfort, con bollitore per tisane e bevande calde, inoltre viene fornita gratuitamente una bottiglietta d’acqua al giorno. Abbiamo apprezzato moltissimo il servizio serale della buonanotte, la gentilezza e la professionalità di tutto il personale. 
Segnaliamo l’ottimo ristorante dell’hotel con un’eccellente varietà e qualità dei piatti a prezzi accessibili. Un ringraziamento speciale a tutto lo staff del servizio serale di ristorazione che ci ha ottimamente consigliato e servito durante le nostre due cene. 
Ci torneremo sicuramente.",5,2017,05,31
120,Unerwartet toll!,"Ich gebe 5 Punkte, weil dieses Hilton das beste Hilton ist - mit Abstand -, in dem ich je genächtigt habe! Und Hilton ist normalerweise nicht meine Kette, wenn ich privat unterwegs bin. Ich mag es noch etwas luxuriöser! Aber dieses Hilton hat mich mehrfach überrascht: Extrem große Zimmer für London, super modernes Bad, absolut ruhig im Zimmer, tolles Restaurant, fantastisches Frühstück, super nettes Personal, sogar mit Doorman, Aufdeckservice (im Hilton!), super stylisch, coole Bar mit Live-Musik, es wird Duftessenz versprüht und duftet überall toll. Was soll ich sagen? Preis-Leistungsverhältnis ist spitze! Und wenn man um die Tate Modern herum etwas machen will, ist die Lage perfekt! Die Tube-Station ist nicht weit, aber die Jubilee Line ist nicht gerade so praktisch. Was seltsam ist, aber das hatte ich schon öfters in Hilton Hotels, die Minibar ist leer! Aber es gab gratis Tee, Kaffee und Mineralwasser! Sehr zu empfehlen! Und deutlich schöner als das Hilton Tower Bridge!",5,2017,05,25
120,Ein ausgezeichnetes Hotel,"Zimmer sehr sauber, Klimaanlage kann man selber aus und einschalten, schalldicht, man hört gar nichts, toller Pool zum entspannen, traumhaftes Frühstücksbuffet (vorallem die Pancakes von Ali) 
Man ist sehr zentral, auch schnell bei den Undergrounds - wir würden dort jederzeit wieder einchecken.
Sehr bequeme Kingsizes Betten",5,2017,05,25
120,Schönes Hilton mit sehr netten Personal ,Bei unseren letzten London Trip haben wir im Hilton Bankside genächtigt. Zunächst ist anzumerken dass das Design des Hotels sehr modern/hip ist kein typisches Hilton Design was mir persönlich sehr gefällt. Der Empfang war sehr freundlich wir checkten bereits um 14 Uhr ein und die gebuchte King Junior Suite war bereits bezugsfertig. Die nette Front Office Agentin erklärte uns das Hotel und die benefits Öffnungszeiten der Executive Lounge etc.. Danach ging es auf das Zimmer auch hier sehr modern und unkonventionell für Hilton in der Junior Suite waren die Snacks und alkoholfreien Getränke in der Minibar inklusive diese wurde auch am zweiten Tag wieder kostenfrei gefüllt. Positiv anzumerken war auch dass der Turn Down Service am Abend tadellos funktionierte und das Zimmer für eine erholsamen Schlaf hergerichtet wurde. Unsere Junior Suite 344 war zum Hinterhof gelegen sehr ruhig wenn man kein Problem damit hat Richtung andere Zimmer Fenster zu schauen. Die Executive Lounge war hervorragend sehr nettes liebevolles Personal insbesondre der aus Ungarn stammende Angestellte der sich mit einer liebevollen Art um seine Gäste kümmerte und viele Tipps für London erzählt hat. Ansonsten am Morgen gibt's eine gute Frühstücksauswahl dann Nachmittags eine Art Afternoon Tea und am Abend gab es zwei warme Snacks ansonsten kaltes Buffet vom Design und der Auswahl eine sehr gute Hilton Lounge vergleichbar mit der im Hilton Frankfurt Airport. Der Gym und Pool klein aber fein alles sehr sauber einziger Kritikpunkt die Desinfektionstücher im gym waren ausgetrocknet. Der Check out am Ende unseres stays war auch freundlich. Ich bin von diesem Hotel begeistert und werde wohl wieder kommen.,5,2017,05,15
120,SPETTACOLARE,"Abbiamo prenotato una camera King in questo hotel tramite un'offerta, al nostro arrivo ci è stata proposta la King Deluxe in quanto disponibile, allo stesso prezzo. Il personale è cordiale e gentile, e alcuni parlano anche italiano. Si trova proprio davanti al Tate modern, a 5 min a piedi dalla stazione di Southwark (sulla linea Jubilee) vicino al borough market che vi consiglio di girare di sabato. La camera è perfetta, il letto in particolare è la vera chicca a mio parere, veramente comodo. ",5,2017,05,04

Cómo alérgica al polvo y con fobia a las moquetas, debo decir que esta estaba impoluta, y no me provocó reacción alguna. La limpieza en general muy buena, muy atentos a los detalles, agua de cortesía cada día, espejo de aumento en el baño. El personal muy profesional y dispuestos a ayudar en todo. Neverita para dejar tus cervecitas que puedes comprar en uno de los dos supers de delante. En general muy recomendable.",5,2017,04,20

Già il nome è una garanzia, HILTON, l'hotel è nuovissimo, con qualsiasi comfort, pulitissimo e, cosa molto difficile da trovare a Londra, le stanze sono veramente spaziose!!! L'hotel dispone di SPA, piscina coperta e palestra. La colazione a buffet offre di tutto dal dolce al salato.
Addirittura ho ricevuto un upgrade della stanza perché al check in, che ho effettuato in mattinata quindi in estremo anticipo ergo colpa mia, la camera non era pronta così me ne hanno assegnata un'altra con la possibilità di consumazioni gratis del frigo bar!!!! Complimenti per la massima gentilezza della receptionist e del concierge!!! Rapporto qualità prezzo estremamente favorevole considerando i prezzi di Londra e del tipo di hotel e servizi offerti.
Di sicuro tornerò!!!",5,2017,04,13

120,Increíble!! súper recomendable!!,"El hotel en todos los sentidos es excepcional:  desde su decoración, al personal súper amable en todos los departamentos: y quiero hacer una mención especial a Philippe: nos atendió muy amable, y cuando se dio cuenta que éramos españoles, comenzó a hablarnos en nuestro idioma y siempre fue muy amable, correcto  y atento para que no nos faltara de nada.
Todo el hotel es muy confortable, te sientes como en casa: muy tranquilo e incluso nada ruidosas las habitaciones, que son muy grandes y la cama lo mejor: comodísima.
El comedor OXBOW del desayuno está decorado con figuras de animales, y dispone de gran variedad de alimentos.
La situación del hotel también es muy buena: a escasos 5 minutos de dos paradas de metro, y muy cerca del Tower Bridge, por lo que hay un agradable paseo por esta zona y con muchos pubs y restaurantes para comer y/o cenar.

Si volvemos a Londres, repetiremos experiencia!!",5,2017,01,02
120,Adecuado,"Hotel bien situado al otro lado del río a escasos 20 minutos de los máximos puntos de interés. El hotel es prácticamente nuevo con habitaciones amplias y muy confortables.
Tuvimos un problema con una alarma de incendios que entiendo fue de forma ocasional, aunque la gestión del incidente fue muy mala y demostró una mala preparación de los empleados para este tipo de situaciones.
Dejando de lado este pequeño incidente, es un hotel recomendable.",4,2016,12,31

120,Consigliato,"L'hotel è nuovo, molto curato e si trova in un'ottima posizione, molto comoda: circa 5 min a piedi dalla stazione di Southwark e a 10 min da quella di Waterloo. Lo staff è molto disponibile e cordiale e ci è stato molto d'aiuto fornendoci informazioni sulla zona non appena siamo arrivati. Le stanze sono ampie e pulitissime. La colazione è il vero punto forte: offre una varietà di cibo incredibile ed è tutto di ottima qualità (il costo di 25£ per noi italiani, che siamo abituati a capuccino e brioches, è elevato, ma consiglio di provarla almeno una volta).

El hotel, decoración, instalaciones, desayuno, acceso al salón vip donde tomarte una copa o comer algo, la piscina, el gimnasio... todo excepcional. El personal super atento y la ubicación perfecta. En una de las zonas de más desarrollo en los últimos años en Londres y muy cerca de la Londres clásica. Volveremos",5,2016,12,07
120,"Hotel nuevo. lujoso , buena relacion calidad precio","He estado cuatro dias en el Hilton de Bankside. El servicio en general es impecable,buena atencion en todo momento. Habitaciones muy comfortables aunque sin vistas. El desayuno correcto bien presentado no muy variado pero bueno. La destilería es un bar de cocktails muy buenos y bien realizados. el único problema es que las habitaciones no están bien aisladas y se escuchan muchos portazos por la mañana.",4,2016,12,06
120,excelente calidad/precio,"Situado cerca de línea de metro, en dos estaciones estas en el centro. A pocos minutos del parlamento, junto a la Tate y frente a la catedral de San Pablo. Rodeado de cafeterías, restaurantes  y pequeños supermercados.
Servicio muy atento, estupendos desayunos y un lugar recomendable para cenar.
No me importaría volver",4,2016,11,28
120,Un Compleanno perfetto in tutti i sensi,"Ho trascorso un weekend a Londra per i 40 anni di mia moglie. Abbiamo trovato presso l'Hilton Bankside una location perfetta, in un quartiere vivo e pieno di opportunità. Il personale dell'hotel ci ha supportato e coccolato al 100%, realizzando in maniera efficiente ogni nostra richiesta e quella dei nostri ospiti. Assolutamente perfetto, dal personale alle camere al fantastico bar Distillery.",5,2016,11,28
120,Super Hotel,"Die Lage des Hotels ist sehr zentral und die U-Bahnstation ganz in der Nähe - man kann aber auch sehr viel zu Fuss unternehmen (Borough Market und The Shard in 5-10min Gehdistanz). Ins Theater Quartier läuft man ca. 20-30 Minuten, ist aber sehr gut machbar.
Das Frühstücksbuffet lässt keine Wünsche offen. Warmes Buffet mit allem, was ein english Breakfast beinhaltet, frische Omeletts oder Waffeln und Pancakes sind ebenfalls im Angebot. Frisch aufgeschnittene Früchte, diverse Brote, Süssgebäck, verschiedene Joghurts - einfach genial!
Mitarbeitende sind sehr kompetent, hilfsbereit und kennen die Gegend gut!
Zudem verfügt das Hotel über einen rund 20 Meter langen Pool, der nach einer Stadtbesichtigung zum lockern der Gelenke einlädt.
Das Zimmer war ruhig zum Innenhof und gross für ein verlängertes Weekend. Wir kommen wieder!!",5,2016,11,26
120,buena relación calidad/precio,"Teniendo en cuenta lo que cuestan los hoteles en Londres, el Hilton Bankside ofrece un servicio muy bueno a un precio razonable. Es un hotel de cinco estrellas en aspectos como la comodidad de las habitaciones, la calidad del desayuno y la amabilidad del personal. Volvería a alojarme sin lugar a dudas",5,2016,11,12
120,Gute Lage und Top Executive Lounge,"Vom Hilton Bankside kann man viel zu Fuß unternehmen. Das Zimmer auf der 6. Etage war modern, ruhig und ausreichend groß, nur etwas dunkel. Die Regendusche im Bad ist zu niedrig angebracht. Wenn man größer ist als 1,85m kann man darunter nicht stehen. Die Executive Lounge ist super inkl. reichhaltigem Frühstück.",4,2016,11,01
120,Week end a Londra,"Siamo stati 2 notti in stanza King.
Personale gentilissimo che cerca di metterti a tuo agio dall'arrivo sino alla tua partenza. Hotel è praticamente nuovo e molto curato nei dettagli, bagno ampio e doccia maxi come piace a noi. Colazione che vale il costo, pasticceria di alto livello. Unica pecca la poca luminosità della camera è un problemino che in fase di prenotazione dall'Italia non erano riusciti a risolvermi ... Altrimenti avrei dato il massimo!",4,2016,10,23

120,Algo anticuado,"El hotel está muy bien situado, cerca del metro y para ir andando a muchos sitios. Buen desayuno. Sin embargo habitación pequeña y antigua. Algo cutrilla para su categoría. También el baño estaba anticuado. Poco ambiente.",3,2016,10,13
120,Agradable para negocios o placer,"Muy bien situado justo detrás de la Tate Modern. Para llegar en transporte público es un poco fastidioso porque no hay metro cerca, pero a cambio cruzas el río por el Millenium Bridge y estás en St. Paul. 
El hotel es moderno sin estridencias. La habitación amplia y cómoda. En un momento dado saltaron los plomos en mi cuarto y sólo tardaron cinco minutos en mandar a alguien para arreglarlo. Me gustó que tenían enchufes europeos además de británicos. El desayuno muy bien y también me gustó su restaurante para cenar. La configuración arquitectónica del hotel implica tejados a distintas alturas y han aprovechado para sembrar allí jardines de plantas silvestres e instalar colmenas. 
Fui por trabajo para una conferencia - sus salas de reuniones están muy bien de configuración y de tamaño para sesiones principales y break-out sessions más pequeñas, aunque al estar distribuidas en dos plantas era un poco incómodo por momentos. El catering de las pausas de café estaba muy bien, para la comida menos entusiasta pero correcto, y con el fallo de no poner mesas donde la gente pudiera instalarse para comer con mediana comodidad.",4,2016,10,13
120,City Trip Hotel,"Wir haben zu zweit, 4 Tage im Hilton gebucht, Preis/Leistung ist gut.
Das Hotel scheint ziemlich neu zu sein, sehr sauber, die Einrichtung ist schön.

120,GENIAL ELECCION EN LONDRES,"UBICACION: La ubicacion no es la mas centrica del mundo pero se puede ir perfectamente andando si te gusta caminar (20 min del Big Ben) y sino tienes una salida de metro que esta a 4 min del hotel (Southwark, Jubilee line), la zona es muy tranquila y bastante nueva. Con un supermercado TESCO en frente para poder tener algo de comida a mano y alguna tienda y un Paul para desayunar.
EL HOTEL: Es muy nuevo con un diseño tipo nordico calido, no es exageradamente grande lo cual se agradece y bastante personal en el lobby que esta siempre pendiente de ayudarte.
Dispone de piscina climatizada y gym, lo cual le da un plus siendo Londres.
EL DESAYUNO: Es bastante variado, te preparan tortillas, huevos....al momento, el personal es muy muy atento y estan pendientes de ti. El desayuno si que es cierto que tiene algunas carencia como la falta de zumos naturales y algo mas de variedad en bolleria con chocolate, algo necesario para ser un cinco estrellas.

LA HABITACION: Muy moderna y espaciosa con buenas toallas, TV plana de facil manejo y bastantes canales. Buenas toallas, buena nevera y agua gratuita que en verano viene muy bien. Dispone de paraguas en la habitacion, albornoz y zapatillas. Muy bien insonorizado de cara al exterior (si que es cierto que las puertas de las habitaciones son muy pesadas y al cerrar meten bastante ruido) el aire acondicionado enfria y calienta rapido. Muy buen colchon y almohadas.
Por la tarde te abren la cama y te dejan agua. El WIFI del hotel va rapidisimo y facil. 
Las maquina de cafe y te de la habitacion gratuito.
DETALLES A MEJORAR SIENDO UN CINCO ESTRELLAS; Al hotel lo que creo que le falta son pequeños detalles que si que he visto en otros Hilton de la misma categoria.
Un detalle al realizar el check in (cookie de bienvenida), algo de bebida y comida para cuando llegas de todo el dia fuera del hotel (agua con limon y dulces). Zumos naturales de distintos sabores (si pides te sirven pero sigue siendo mezcla). Mas cantidad de amenities en la habitacion (realmente escasos siendo un cinco estrellas) y por ultimo dejar algo en la almohada al preparar la cama por la tarde (bombon, galletas..)
PRECIO: En mi caso encontre un precio muy muy competente para ser Londres (170 con desayuno y noche) lo cual hizo que mi estancia me pareciese perfecta.
CONCLUSION: El personal super predispuesto y amable, el hotel muy nuevo y moderno, las habitaciones amplias y muy comodas. La distancia andando al hotel muy salvable.
GENIAL",4,2016,09,13
120,Gran hotel con una excelente situación,"Es con seguridad uno de los mejores hoteles en los que he estado. Modernas instalaciones, con amplias muy cómodas y tranquilas habitacione s y una atención superior lo hacen una excelente elección para cualquier tipo de viaje.

120,“5* für das Haus und ein Extra für den Doorman”,"Das Hilton London Bankside ist ein erstklassiges Hotel.

Die Lage ist ausgezeichnet und man kann sehr viele Sehenswürdigkeiten zu Fuß erreichen, nur ein paar Schritte zur Themse und z.B. zur Tate Modern Galery.

Sehr schönes Wohlfühl-Ambiente! Die Bar und Lounge laden zu einem Abend mit ausgezeichneten Drinks und Cocktails ein.

Die Executive Lounge ist eine der schönsten, welche wir in einem Hilton kennen lernen durften. Uns erwartete ein ordentliches mit regionalem Produkten bestücktes Angebot an Snacks und Getränken. Top-Service!

Der Check-in verlief freundlich und schnell, alles sehr professionell.

Die Suite war geräumig und sehr geschmackvoll sowie praktisch eingerichtet und bietet jede Annehmlichkeit, nichts zu bemängeln. Schöne Aussichten inklusive! Das Bad ist groß genug und bietet ebenso genügend Platz für die Alltäglichkeiten.
Hilton-typisch das Bett, sehr bequem, wir haben wieder sehr gut geschlafen.

Die hohen Erwartungen wurden nicht enttäuscht.

Man ist immer um den Gast bemüht und man fühlt sich rundherum wohl in diesem Hotel.

Die tollen Mitarbeiter, insbesondere der deutschsprachige (aus Ungarn stammende) Doorman, werden uns definitiv in Erinnerung bleiben.

Für eine erneute Reise nach London ist das Hilton Bankside unsere 1. Wahl.

Thumb up!",5,2016,08,25
120,Buena ubicación,"Hotel elegante, con habitaciones muy acogedoras. Servicio muy atento. Emplazamiento tranquilo. Desayuno correcto pero mejorable. Nuestra estancia hubiera sido muy satisfactoria si el desayuno hubiera sido el de un hotel de la categoría del Hilton.",3,2016,08,17

120,Für einen Londontrip sehr zu empfehlen,"Recht neues Hilton Hotel in London, Eröffnung im Oktober 2015.
Lage ist super, in direkter Nähe von Tate Gallery und Globe Theatre. Waterloo Station und Southwark Station der U-Bahn sind wenige hundert Meter entfernt. Über die Millennium Bridge ist man in wenigen Minuten zu Fuß an St Pauls Cathedral.
Die Zimmer sind für ein Londoner 4-Sterne Hotel großzügig geschnitten.
Das Personal erlebten wir in allen Servicebereichen als ausgesprochen freundlich, kompetent und hilfsbereit. Schon beim Check In war dies sehr erfreulich spürbar.
Wir hatten Glück und haben ein Upgrade in einen Suite erhalten. Die Executive Lounge ist recht groß und hat ein ordentliches Angebot an Snacks und Getränken.
In direkter Nähe zum Hotel gibt es ein großes Angebot an Kneipen. Restaurants, Bars etc..
Das Hotel kann ich für einen Londonaufenthalt sehr empfehlen.",5,2016,08,05
120,Sorprendida gratamente,"Siempre que sales de España, las estrellas que califican los hoteles suelen estar por debajo del nivel al que estamos acostumbrados aquí, pero con este hotel, de verdad, me he sorprendido, nos ha gustado mucho y sin duda si podemos volveremos y lo recomendaremos al mismo tiempo.

Lo reserve con una ""oferta/paquete"" de Voyage Prive, no he mirado detenidamente lo que costaría reservarlo directamente, pero siempre vas con miedo (en mi caso sobretodo habiéndome dedicado una pequeña parte de mi vida al turismo) de donde te meten estas nuevas agencias online (mi hermano ya ha viajado con ellos previamente por lo que ha hecho de conejillo de indias por mi, la verdad que genial, estaba incluido el desayuno (no había días para probar todo lo que ofrecían jejeje) y un 20% en el restaurante (al cálculo lo que te ahorras son lo que pagarías por las propinas).

Llegamos el miércoles súper temprano, ya había llamado yo un par de días antes para confirmar y el hombre que me atendió al teléfono, me dijo que aunque el check in era a las 15h si había alguna habitación disponible nos la ofrecerían, así fue, cuando llegamos nos atendió una chica que es lo que hizo, eso si previo pago de casi 40£ por noche dijimos que no, claro está, a pesar de que intento persuadirnos que era más grande, con salón..., eso no me convence, porque cuando viajo de turismo sólo quiero el hotel para dormir (en una buena cama) y poder ducharme agusto después de patear la ciudad cuando vuelvo al hotel, y menos mal, que no aceptamos, porque ya la habitación estándar era grande, la cama bastante grande también, y que almohadas, súper cómodo todo, tienes una tele creo q como de 46 pulgadas (que puedes oír desde el baño si quieres) un sofá, el armario bastante amplio, con espejos e iluminado (señoras olvidense de cargar con el secador, tienen uno de verdad, y no de juguete como suele pasar) luego otro armario, con baldas, tabla de planchar y plancha, y una cosa de verdad muy positiva, caja fuerte y la programas tú solo sin necesidad de contratar en recepción.

El baño, muy amplio todo súper limpio y nuevo, las toallas super suaves y un albornoz para cada uno.

Está súper bien situado, (fue la razón principal para elegirlo a la hora de la reserva) casi justo detras de la Tate Modern.

Hay un pero, en la web en español (sitio oficial de Hoteles Hilton, para entendernos) dice que ofrecen servicio de autobús desde el aeropuerto hasta Victoria Station, es un gravísimo error de la web, menos mal que fui precavida y como os cuento llame días antes, no hay servicio de transporte desde/hasta el aeropuerto, esto creo que debe mejorar ya que es un 5 estrellas y por lo menos aquí en España hay hoteles donde si que lo ofrecen.

El hotel tiene piscina interior, pero no puedo opinar porque ya no me daban las fuerzas de todo lo que andé en 4 días.",5,2016,07,30
120,Muy buen hotel....,"Un muy buen servicio , ubicado en un lugar tranquilo y cerca de todo para conocer Londres.

120,GRAN HOTEL. EXCELENTE PERSONAL.,"Segunda estancia este año en el hotel y decir que es un alojamiento excepcional. Todo el servicio está muy cuidado. Como Hilton Honors Diamond recibimos un trato inmejorable. Solo recomendarles que mejoren la calidad del café y del pan en el desayuno. El pan parecía siempre ""viejo"", como que no era fresco del día, aunque realmente lo era. Gracias al señor Alex Frank y al señor Goethe del salón ejecutivo por un trato tan agradable. Volveremos.",5,2016,07,13
120,Sehr gut!,Ich habe drei Nächte im Hilton Bankside verbracht und es war von Anfang bis Ende alles super! Das Personal ist außerordentlich nett und kümmert sich perfekt um seine Kunden. Die Zimmer sind modern und stylisch eingerichtet. Das Frühstücksbuffet lässt keine wünsche offen und ist einfach spitze.,5,2016,07,12
120,Lusso e comodità,"L'hotel si trova a pochi minuti a piedi dalla Tate Modern, in riva al Tamigi. Autobus e metropolitana sono vicinissimi, quindi la posizione è molto comoda per i mezzi pubblici. Ho soggiornato qui per un week end, e sono stato trattato come un principe. Il personale è stato sempre incredibilmente cortese e servizievole; la camera assegnata, pur bellissima e conforme a quanto prenotato, era ad un piano basso. Su nostra richiesta ce ne è stata assegnata un'altra ad un piano più alto, ed abbiamo avuto contestualmente un notevole upgrade ad una cifra ragionevolissima. Abbiamo potuto apprezzare non solo le lussuose caratteristiche della camera e dell'hotel in genere, pulitissimo e nuovissimo, ma anche il centro fitness, la piscina riscaldata, ed il ristorante. Ho soggiornato in molti alberghi in tutto il mondo, compresi molti Hilton, ma questo in particolare mi ha piacevolmente sorpreso, e davvero mi sono sentito come un ospite gradito. Consiglio vivamente questo albergo sia per soggiorni in famiglia che per motivi di lavoro.",5,2016,07,06

120,"Sehr gut, aber nicht außergewöhnlich","Wir haben zwei Nächte in einem King Deluxe Room übernachtet (Zi 417). Die Lage des Hotels fanden wir sehr gut, in Laufweite zur Underground ""Southwark"" und nur ein paar Schritte zur Themse mit Tate Modern & Co. Das Zimmer hat eine gute Größe, ein bequemes Bett, ein Bad mit schöner Regendusche (guter Druck, keine Überschwemmungsgefahr) und genug Ablagemöglichkeiten. Nach unserem Geschmack hätte das Zimmer mehr Tageslicht haben (wie gesagt 4. Stock) und mit etwas mehr Charme eingerichtet sein können. Die Tür vom Schrank zum Safe geht direkt zur Eingangstür auf - leichte Unfallgefahr. Etwas gestört hat uns das sehr laute Geräusch, wenn die Türen zu den Zimmern und auch zum Bad zuschlagen. Das hätte man echt geschickter bzw. geräuschdämmender lösen können. Sehr angenehm empfanden wir das Personal bei Check in und Frühstück - immer ansprechbar und hilfsbereit und nicht aufdringlich. Check in und Ckeck out waren total effizient. Das Frühstück fanden wir gut - gute Auswahl, gute Qualität (frischer Orangensaft, Pastries, gutes Bircher Müsli) und nicht zu überlaufen. Alles in allem Daumen hoch für das Hilton Southbank, wir kommen gern wieder!",4,2016,06,28

120,Just perfect,"Hotel impeccabile. Curato nei minimi dettagli, dal letto al bagno. Lo staff è molto cordiale e professionale. La posizione, ragione per cui avevano prenotato qui, è centrale, perfetta per raggiungere qualsiasi zona di Londra. La colazione è straordinaria, vale assolutamente il costo aggiuntivo. ",5,2016,06,28
120,Gutes Hotel mit Luft nach oben ....,"Das Hotel befindet sich ca. 5-7 Minuten zu Fuß von der U-Bahn Station Southwark (Jubilee Line) entfernt. 

Mein Check in verlief freundlich, wenngleich die Rezeptionistin den Wunsch meinerseits nach einem Zimmer mit einer Dusche (es gibt in der Standard Kategorie sowohl Zimmer mit Badewanne oder Dusche) zu einem Ugrade zu 25 Pfund die Nacht nutzen wollte. Nachdem ich bestimmt ablehnte war die Sache auch erledigt, dennoch empfinde ich persönlich diese Verkaufsversuche in einem Haus der 5-Sterne Kategorie für mich als Gast und Kunde tendenziell als unangenehm, denn wenn ich ein größeres Zimmer gewollt hätte, dann hätte ich doch eines gebucht. 

Das Zimmer war für Londoner Verhältnisse sehr groß (ca. 30 qm). Das Bett war sehr bequem, der TV bot zumindest ARD als deutsches TV Programm an. Warum man den zweiten Platz für einen deutschen TV Kanal für ARD Arte (absoluter Spartenkanal) verschwendet hat und nicht beispielsweise das ZDF als den anderen öffentlich rechtlichen Kanal eingespielt hat, wird wohl das Geheimnis des Hotels bleiben. 
Ansonsten hat der Designer des Zimmers für mich wenig nachvollziehbaren Geschmack an den Tag gelegt. Grau in Grau, alles sehr duster im 70 er Chic. Edel und elegant ist anders, neu war's und vielleicht mag es ja jemand. 
Schön war die Minibar, welche neben den bereitsgestellten Getränken noch reichlich Platz für eigene Dinge bot. 
Ansonsten bot das Zimmer alle der Kategorie angemessen Aussattungsmerkmale u.a. Zimmersafe, Bademantel, Badeschuhe. Leider kein internationales Steckersortiment – man benötigt demnach einen Adapter. 

Das Badezimmer war etwas geschmackvoller als das Zimmer, gute Beleuchtung und insgesamt auch sauber. Dar Steinboden in der Walk In Dusche erwies sich hinsichtlich Pflege für den Hotelgebrauch jedoch eher als ungeeignet. Bereits unübersehbare Abutzungserscheingungen. 

Etwas irritierend fand ich den Umstand, dass ich am Abreisetag gegen 11:00 h auf mein Zimmer zurück kam (Check out Zeit ist 12:00 h) und sich das Zimmermädchen bereits darin zu Schaffen gemacht hatte unter dem Vorwand, sie dachte, es sei ein Bleibezimmer. Dass sich das Zimmermädchen in einem Haus dieser Kategorie vor der offiziellen Check out Zeit in das Zimmer begibt, geht halt eigentlich gar nicht. In der Folge hätte ich auch die Dusche gar nicht mehr nutzen können, da mein Badetuch bereits auf dem Boden der Dusche zwecks Reinigung ausgebreitet war. 
Der Umstand, dass das Zimmermädchen noch meine auf dem Bett verteilten Kosmetikartikel einfach in meinen Waschbeutel räumte, ist auch etwas sehr gewagt. Ich meldete diesen Vorfall auch der Rezeptionistin beim Check out, die sich auch umgehend dafür entschuldigte. Trotzdem unglaublich irritierend und unseriös. 

Frühstücksbuffet: Schönes Ambiente im Restaurant, gutes Buffet, Service sehr freundlich aber etwas unorganisiert. Mehrmals stand eine andere Servicekraft am Tisch. 

Insgesamt neues und sehr gutes Haus der Hilton Kette. In Anbetracht, dass ich eine gute Rate inklusive dem Frühstück ergattern konnte, gestaltet sich mein Gesamteindruck auch absolut positiv. Dennoch ist wie beschrieben in manchen Bereichen durchaus noch Luft nach oben.",4,2016,06,26
120,Visita a Londres,"En general la estancia ha sido agradable y la situación del hotel es bastante buena. Algunos aspectos hacen que para el precio que se paga,la relación calidad /precio se vea por debajo de lo que sería admisible en una cadena del prestigio Hilton.",3,2016,06,13
120,So muss es sein...,"Das Hotel ist toll. Ich hatte ein Executive Zimmer, welches wirklich super war, Minibar inklusive. Pool war schön groß, Fitnessstudio klein aber OK. Der Service war herrausragend. Zu Fuß läuft man ca. 5min bis zur nächsten U-Bahn Station (Southwark), 30min zu Fuß bis Westminster. 
Ich komme wieder!",5,2016,06,09
120,Increíblemente perfecto. Mi nuevo hotel en Londres,"Me he alojado dos noches. Me ha sorprendido la amabilidad del personal (Gracias Anthony por tu gran sonrisa y tu profesionalidad en el check-in). Personal amable y detallista. Todos elegantemente vestidos. La decoración fantástica. El buffet excelente. La situación muy buena, he podido ir cada día andando al trabajo. Este será mi nuevo hotel en Londres....aunque la próxima vez pediré otra habitación :-) la 346 es un poquito pequeña.... y aún así me ha parecido encantadora. Recomendable 100%.",5,2016,06,08
120,Freundlich und ruhig,"Hervorzuheben sind die Freundlichkeit und Hilfsbereitschaft des Personals, die ruhige und zentrale Lage in Gehdistanz zu Borough Market, Tate Modern und vielen weiteren Sehenswürdigkeiten. Sehr gut gefallen haben uns auch die Zimmergröße und die Wellness- und Fitnessbereiche.  

Etwas befremdlich hingegen war, dass man uns ein offensichtlich für Rollstuhlfahrer konzipiertes Zimmer zugeteilt hatte. Die ganzen roten Alarmseile, die von der Decke hingen, sowie die vielen Hilfsvorrichtungen im Bad ließen den unbehaglichen Eindruck eines Sanatoriums aufkommen. 

Sehr unpraktisch war außerdem die Hängeleuchte über dem Kopfteil des einen Bettes, wo man sich unweigerlich mindestens einmal den Kopf dran stößt, und die völlige Abwesenheit von Handtuchhaltern im Bad. Ebenfalls eher unzweckmäßig ist der Umstand, dass man das Licht fürs Bad am Bett ein- und ausschalten muss.

Der Preis von GBP 20.00 fürs Frühstück scheint uns etwas hoch bemessen. In unmittelbarer Umgebung gibt es aber einige gute Cafés, wo man bestens frühstücken kann, was sich vor allem dann rechnet, wenn man in der Früh nicht allzu üppige Mahlzeiten zu sich nimmt. 

Trotzdem bleibt ein durchaus positiver Gesamteindruck, und vermutlich würden wir das Hilton Bankside erneut buchen, allerdings unter der Voraussetzung, ein normales Zimmer bewohnen zu dürfen.",4,2016,06,06
120,Muy bueno ,"Esta ubicado en una excelente zona muy cerca de mis empresas de seguros que tenia que visitar.  Lo único que no me gusta que no hay opción para el desayuno,  lo cual lo hace costoso.  Pero por otro lado habitaciones a grandes y buen servicio ",4,2016,06,02

120,Super Hotel - Gute Lage - Bar schlecht,"Super Hotel - Gute Lage  Bar schlecht: Die Rechnung war falsch. Es wurde nicht zu viel berechnet sondern zu wenig. Anstandshalber haben wir darauf hingewiesen. Nach ca. 20 Minuten haben wir die korrigierte Abrechnung, die ja zu Gunsten der Bar ausging, erhalten. Eine gezwungene Entschuldigung war zumindest gegeben. Bereits am Tag davor wurde von uns ein wässriges Getränk serviert (mit 98% Eis gefüllt), zumindest wurde dieses nach Reklamation nicht berechnet.",4,2016,05,25
120,Estancia inolvidable,"Muy buena ubicación, a 5 min andando del la parada del metro Southwark, muy cerca del Tate modern museum. 
Después de una larga jornada de turismo por Londres, un recuperador baño en la piscina es todo un lujo.
Teniendo en cuenta lo caros que son los hoteles en Londres y las características del hotel, conseguimos una muy buena oferta.
Repetiría sin dudarlo.",5,2016,05,20
120,Schickes verkehrsgünstiges Hotel,"Das Hilton Bankside liegt unmittelbar hinter der Tate Modern. Es ist neu, sauber, schön eingerichtet, verfügt über eine coole Bar (setzen Sie sich an die Bar und probieren Sie die Bierauswahl!) und hat die bequemsten Betten überhaupt (wir hatten ein Twin-Bed-Zimmer, also zwei etwa 1,40 Meter breite Betten). 

Allerdings ist es auch nicht gerade billig. Für diesen Preis hätte ich aber ein Zimmer mit etwas Tageslicht oder Aussicht erwartet. Unser Zimmer lag allerdings im ersten Stock mit Blick auf eine - sehr schöne - Mauer. Kein Himmel zu sehen, keine Aussicht, allerdings natürlich auch kein Straßenlärm. Da sich die Fenster allerdings nicht öffnen lassen ist dies wohl ohnehin unerheblich. Umzug in ein höheres Stockwerk wurde gegen Aufpreis (ca. 40 Pfund pro Nacht) angeboten. Nachdem der Preis pro Nacht ohnehin bei EUR 250,- lag (Geld war zu einem für das Hilton günstigen Kurs schon längst abgebucht, zum Zeitpunkt der Reise lag das Pfund 30 % niedriger), haben wir abgelehnt. Wer einen Lottogewinn gemacht hat kann hier also unbesorgt übernachten. Ansonsten empfehle ich dieses Hotel nur für einen Wochenendtrip oder für Paris-Hilton-Fans (irgendwo muß deren Kohle ja herkommen).",4,2016,05,09
120,Bella esperienza,"Note positive: Centralissima, la colazione è spettacolare e il letto è superconfortevole super accessibile anche in sedia a rotelle.. Note negative: la pulizia lascia a desiderare e la spa non viene utilizzata perchè un po fredda ",3,2016,04,26
120,semplicemento perfetto,"Premetto che ho la tessera Diamond di Hilton Honors, ma avendo prenotato tremite sito terzo non erano tenuti a riconoscermi i benefits.Invece me li hanno riconosciuti lo stesso, così abbiamo usufruito di un upgrade ad una Junior Suite molto carina, dell'ingresso all'executive lounge ( di qualità e con staff eccellente) e della colazione al ristorante. Abbiamo soggiornato dal 6 all'8 Aprile e tutto è stato impeccabile. Staff attento e gentile e ottima posizione vicinissimo alla Tate modern, e una nota per la colazione: la qualità che abbiamo riscontrato è elevatissima.Complimenti e di sicuro ci tornerei.",5,2016,04,25
120,Excelente en todo,"Todo excelente. Servicio atento, habitaciones amplias, muyyy comodas y con grandes detalles. El
Hotel en sí es muy bonito, acogedor, moderno y sin perder el toque londinense. Además, la zona es perfecta porque estás a 15-20' de todo y además estás tranquilo y bien comunicado. Volveré sin duda.",5,2016,04,23
120,Sehr schönes Hotel in London,"Ein super Hotel für Städtetrip in London!   In direkter Umgebung befinden sich zahlreiche Restaurants, Cafés und Einkaufsläden. Die Underground-Station ""Southwark"" ist problemlos zu Fuß zu erreichen (ca. 5 Gehminuten). Ebenso schnell befindet man sich direkt an der Themes wo es weitere Restaurants, Cafés und Sehenswürdigkeiten gibt. Wir haben uns ein wenig wie in der Hamburger Hafencity gefühlt – alles relativ neu und Modern und viele Geschäftsleute. Da in dieser Gegend sehr viele Firmen/Büros niedergelassen sind, ist es am Wochenende deutlich ruhiger als unter der Woche.  Hier die Punkte die wir am Hotel/Zimmer extra hervorheben möchten: + Modern und qualitativ Hochwertig eingerichtet + Safe, Bügelbrett mit Bügeleisen, Bademäntel und Badelatschen im Zimmer + alles sehr sauber und ordentlich + Personal ist sehr freundlich und zuvorkommend + WLAN in der Lobby und auf dem Zimmer funktioniert problemlos + Minibar/Kühlschrank bietet ausreichend Platz für Getränke oder kleine Snacks  Uns ist eigentlich nichts Negatives aufgefallen. Insgesamt haben wir uns 3 Nächte (Fr. – Mo.) im Hilton Bankside aufgehalten und durchgehend sehr wohl gefühlt. Ich persönlich würde dieses Hotel wieder buchen, sofern ich in dieselbe Ecke von London möchte.  Wir haben nicht im Hotel gegessen, da es außerhalb mehr als genug Möglichkeiten gibt. Somit kann ich zum Frühstück/Mittag/Abendessen bzw. Zimmerservice keine Bewertung abgeben.",5,2016,04,13
120,Traumhaft,"Wir buchen in London immer Hilton Hotels - und dieses neu erbaute ist eines der besten; schon nur das Duftkonzept in der Eingangshalle - meine bessere Hälfte war nach 2 Sekunden bereits hellauf begeistert.  Frühstücksbuffet -> Top!  Zimmer -> Top - wir hatten eins zum Innenhof; die anfängliche (leichte) Enttäuschung ist aber schnell der Erkenntnis gewichen, dass es wohl keine ruhigere Übernachtungsmöglichkeit in ganz London geben wird  Das Personal war ebenfalls äusserst zuvorkommend, nett und hilfsbereit.  Wir würden jederzeit wieder dort buchen!",5,2016,04,12
120,"Tolles, neues Hotel - aber die Kleinigkeiten...","Das Hotel ist neu und dementsprechend gut ausgestattet. Hervorragende Betten, für Londoner Verhältnisse riesige Zimmer, ein großer Fernseher und eine tolle Dusche. Das Personal ist sehr freundlich, hilfsbereit und lächelt stets. 
Leider sind da so einige Kleinigkeiten, bei denen das Design offenbar Vorrang vor der Nützlichkeit hat. So gibt es keinen Haken für Jacke oder Mantel, so dass man diese ggf. nass in den Schrank hängen muss. Auch für die kleinen Handtücher im Bad gibt es keine Möglichkeit zum Aufhängen. Und das Toilettenpapier ist so dünn, dass man fast hindurch sehen kann. 
Entschädigt wird man aber durch das Frühstück. Eine große Auswahl, dazu handgemachtes Müsli, frisch gepresster Orangensaft und drei Köche, die sich um Eier, Pfannkuchen und andere Wünsche kümmern. 
Bis zur Tube oder zur Bushaltestellen ist es nicht weit. Drei Supermärkte sind in unmittelbarer Nähe des Hotels. 
Das kostenlose WLAN ist für Mails und normales Surfen voll ausreichend, keine Notwendigkeit kostenpflichtig upzugraden. 
Insgesamt sehr empfehlenswert.",5,2016,04,05
120,"A pochi minuti dalla Tate Modern, nuovissimo e confortevole, in ottima posizione","Sulla riva sud del Tamigi, a pochi minuti dalla Tate Modern e dalla passeggiata lungofiume (Bankside), in una zona completamente rinnovata e molto interessante. È in una posizione strategica per visitare Londra, vicinissimo alla metro e alla stazione ferroviaria di Blackfriars (dove arrivano collegamenti diretti dall'aeroporto di Luton).

L'hotel è nuovissimo e molto confortevole con camere ben arredate e silenziose, il servizio eccellente e lo staff molto cortese. In definitiva, un rapporto qualità / prezzo positivo. Consigliatissimo!",4,2016,04,05
120,Ganz Ok,"Ganz Ok. Frühstück eher bescheiden. Die Executive Lounge ist nicht ihr Aufpreis wert. Zimmer Sind neu und modern aber ohne Fenster. Lage ist okay, ca 10 Minuten zufuß bis Ubahn, kleiner Supermarkt direkt vor der Tür. Wenn man gut zufus ist kann man die meisten Sehenswürdigkeiten in 30-40Min erreichen.",4,2016,04,02
120,Una posizione startegica,Ubicato in una posizione strategica e di recente costruzione l'Hotel è accogliente e confortevole. Personale completamente a disposizione e molto disponibile. Si consiglia di consumare la prima colazione presso l'hotel: ottima qualità del cibo e vasta possibilità di scelta,4,2016,03,29
120,Top Hotel!,"Bei Hotels in London denkt man oft an kleine Zimmern in alten Gebäuden. Dies alles trifft nicht auf das Hilton London Bankside zu!

Das Hotel wurde komplett renoviert und war hatten ein sehr schönes und geräumiges Zimmer.

Bar, Restaurant und Executive Lounge waren gut besucht, aber nicht überlaufen.

Eine Empfehlung!",5,2016,03,20
120,"Zimmer, Service, Lage bestens","Ausgezeichnetes Hotel im Zentrum Londons. Gehobene Küche, gute Bar und auch mal für ein Geschäftstreffen mit bis zu 50 Teilnehmern geeignet. Der Rest der erforderlichen 200 Zeichen ist für die Bewertung überflüssig, denn es ist Alles gesagt.",4,2016,03,09
120,"Tutto bene...ma perché la "" galera"" dei piumini?",Viaggio abbastanza spesso per lavoro. Confermo che lo standard di questo albergo e' elevato c'è quello che ti aspetti in un ambiente curato e piacevole. Personalmente non sopporto i piumini soprattutto come in questo caso quando il peso e' rilevante. Non è' sufficiente avere un letto comodo ( e ammetto che quelli dell'hilton sono di ottimo livello) ma la personalizzazione di questo aspetto sarebbe per me importante.,3,2016,02,21
120,Ein neuer Standard für Hotels in London City!,"Sehr modernes Hotel in toller Lage, schöne, gerãumige Zimmer, ausgezeichnete Gastronomie gleich im Hause, das gibt es in London City auch ganz anders! Zudem sind die Zimmer zum Innenhof schön ruhig. Der Service war zuvorkommend und persönlich- Ich war rundum zufrieden!",5,2016,02,19
120,Una sola notte... ma da favola,"Ottima struttura in una ottima posizione vicinissima al Thames con tutte le sue attrazioni: Tate Museum, London Eye, London Sea Life Aquarium... insomma, c'è l'imbarazzo della scelta! 
L'hotel è in una costruzione molto recente ed è molto curato in tutti i particolari. 
Il peronale estremamente gentile e disponibile, veramente un ottimo benvenuto appena arrivati!
Sono stato spostato di camera rispetto quella che avevo originariamente prenotato, ma è stato sicramente meglio così perchè mi sono trovato in una bellissima stanza al quinto piano (506), spaziosa ed arredata con gusto. Pulizia impeccabile e letto comodissimo.
La colazione del mattino fa rimpiangere il non poter restare sedut al tavolo a mangiare per ore tanta era la scelta di cibo... attenzione però alla linea!",5,2016,01,28
120,"Nuovo, bello...Hilton!","L'hotel è stato aperto da poco, le finiture e la modernità sono di alto livello.
Si trova a 7 minuti a piedi dalla stazione metro Southwark, a un tiro di schioppo dalla Tate modern. Zona tranquilla, un pò  morta di sera anche se il locale ""The Ring"" che si trova appena fuori la stazione metro è molto carino.
La camera era spaziosa, il bagno ampio e pieno di tutti i comfort. Qualità Hilton nei prodotti.
Si dormiva veramente bene, il letto era grande e accogliente. Rumori non se ne sentivano.
Non abbiamo preso la colazione che costa tanto e abbiamo sfruttato il bollitore e il thè messo a disposizione nella camera prendendo qualche brioche in uno dei due vicinissimi supermarket.
Esperienza ottima, consiglierei a chiunque questa soluzioni se fosse disponibile un'offerta o una promozione come quella che abbiamo trovato noi.",5,2016,01,23
120,Einfach klasse,"Wir hatten ein Deluxe-Zimmer im 7. Stock. Sehr geschmackvolle Einrichtung. Hervorragender Service und erstklassiges Frühstück. Das Personal ist äußerst zuvorkommend und freundlich, aber nicht aufdringlich. Die Lage des Hotels ist sehr gut für einen Städtetrip.",5,2016,01,18
120,Super Hotel im Herzen von London,"Lage: 2 Fussminuten zum Fluss und 3 Minuten zur Metrostation. Viele kleine Lebensmittelläden in unmittelbarer Nähe.  Service im Hotel sehr freundlich und hilfsbereit und vorallem professionell. Zimmer modern ausgestattet. Frühstück und Restaurant: grosse Menuauswahl, sehr fein. Würde wieder gehen.",5,2016,01,02
120,Modernes sauberes Hotel,Wir waren für 3 Tage im Hilton Hotel Bankside. Alles war sehr neu und sehr sauber. Das Personal war sehr freundlich und das inbegriffene Frühstücksbuffet sehr umfangreich und lecker. Auch die Lage ist sehr angenehm mit 5 Gehminuten zur nächsten Underground Station und dem Tate Modern und Globe Theater um die Ecke. Wir haben nichts zu meckern bis auf die sehr unpassende Check in Zeit um 15h. Wir waren bereits morgens in London und konnten unser Zimmer erst sehr spät beziehen.,4,2015,12,20
120,Viaggio di lavoro a 5*,"Sono stato in questo hotel per 2 notti, per un viaggio di lavoro, in modalità b&b. E' indubbiamente un hotel di lusso, e il costo lo dimostra ampiamente. Offre, conseguentemente, un livello qualitativo molto alto, sia per la camera, dotata di tutti i confort (ma se volete l'asciugacapelli dovete richiederlo in reception).
Cuscini e materassi di ottima qualità, biancheria da camera (asciugamani, accappatoi, ciabattine) di ottima fattura, illuminazione in camera molto ""suggestiva"".
La colazione é un tripudio di ogni cosa ci si possa aspettare, con una grande varietà internazionale e parecchi piatti fatti al momento (ottime le omelettes).
Infine, qualità e cortesia costanti, efficienza e, visto il periodo natalizio, anche una piacevole ambientazione natalizia con addobbi di qualità, completano il quadro molto positivo.
Da provare, se si é pronti a spendere una cifra non proprio alla portata di tutte le tasche (seppur adeguata alla qualifica dell'hotel).",5,2015,12,16
120,Das Beste Hilton in dem ich bisher war,"Das Hilton London Bankside ist sicher das Beste Hilton in dem ich bisher war und gehört zu den besten Hotels in denen ich bisher generell war.

Die Zimmer sind sehr stilvoll eingerichtet. Möbel sind hochwertig und alles ist stets äußerst sauber. 
Unschlagbar ist jedoch der Service.  Perfekt saubere Zimmer, kleine Aufmerksamkeiten auf dem Zimmer durch den ""Nachmittagsservice"" oder die Servicekräfte vom Restaurant bzw. Frühstücksbüffet - alles hervorragend.

Der Knaller ist jedoch das Frühstück! Eine riesengroße Auswahl an frischen Produkten und Speisen, die frisch zubereitet werden. Dazu noch du unglaublich unterhaltsame Küchenchefin die das warten amüsant macht. Super!

Das Hotel ist wirklich  sehr empfehlenswert!",5,2015,12,03
120,Rundum SUPER!!!,"Es war wirklich ein wunderschöner Aufenthalt!! Lage ist super. 2 Haltestellen von Westminster. Underground 5min zu Fuß. Nebenan direkt ein kleiner Supermarkt, Geldautomat und ein kleines Café mit leckerem Frühstück. In der Nähe kann man super lecker und günstig essen gehen. Italiener, Tapas, Asiate (seeehr zu empfehlen!!),... 
Hotel ist sehr modern, schöne Zimmer und modernes Bad. Nichts auszusetzen!
Pool war leider noch nicht geöffnet.
Besonders toll war der Service. Vor allem der Conciergeservice. Einfach unglaublich nett. Uns wurde ein Tisch kurzfristig im Aqua (im höchsten Gebäude von London mit hammer Blick) organisiert. Als wir um die Ecke essen waren und es plötzlich angefangen hat zu regnen dann kam der Concierge unaufgefordert!!! vorbei um uns einen Schirm zu bringen. Sowas nettes hab ich noch nie erlebt!!

Vielen Dank für den tollen Aufenthalt!!!",5,2015,11,30
120,Das habe ich noch nie erlebt,"Das Hotel ist noch keine zwei Monate alt, brandneu. 

TourDoctor checkt vor gut zwei Wochen am Montag abend (eigentlich schon Dienstag früh) zwischen halb eins und ein Uhr ein. Am Check in sind drei Mitarbeiter : einer möchte mir mein Gepäck tragen, der andere macht den eigentlichen Check in, der dritte unterhält sich mit mir über irgendwelche belanglosigkeiten auf deutsch. Der Check in Mitarbeiter nimmt meine Kreditkarte und braucht dann gut zehn Minuten, bis er mir meine Zimmerkarte fertig gemacht hat - das System... Naja. Er gibt mir dann meine Kreditkarte zurück und erklärt mir, dass er die Karte gleich in meinem Profil im System hinterlegt hat (ich bin HH Diamonds Member), da wäre noch eine andere Karte drin gewesen. Na schön, aber das muss ja nicht unbedingt mitten in der Nacht sein. Ich will um 1 h morgens nicht mein Profil ändern, sondern möglichst schnell ins Bett. 

Endlich bin ich dann im Zimmer (327), schaut alles super aus, alles so schön wie auf der Hilton Website, sehr bequemes Bett, TourDoctor schläft ein.

Plötzlich, es wird wohl so irgendwann zwischen halb 2 und 2 Uhr gewesen sein, klingelt das Telefon. Der deutsch sprechende Kerl ist dran. Er erklärt mir, dass beim Check in leider miene Kreditkartendaten nicht richtig erfasst worden wären. Ich solle doch bitte jetzt gleich nochmal vorbeischauen, damit man die Daten meiner Karte habe. Ist der Kerl eigentlich von allen guten Geistern verlassen ? Weckt einen Gast einfach auf, weil er und seine Kumpels beim Check in einen Fehler gemacht haben ? Ich lehne ab, bitte ihn, meine Nachtruhe zu wahren und sage ihm, dass er die Karte morgen früh vor meiner Abreise nochmal haben kann. Er lässt nicht locker : Wenn ich nicht bereit bin, zur Rezeption zu kommen, dann wird jemend zu mir kommen und meine Karte holen. Langsam bin ich wieder voll wach, geladen. Und tatsächlich : Der Kerl macht seine Drohung wahr. Ca. 5 Minuten später klopft es an meiner Tür, irgend ein anderer Mitarbeiter will meine Karte haben und mitnehmen. Ich gebe ihm schulssendlich die Karte, mit einem mulmigen Gefühl, nur weil ich endlich Ruhe haben will. 

Am Morgen finde ich die Karte wieder, unter den Türschlitz durchgeschoben, zusammen mit einem Gutschein für ein Getränk an der Bar. 

Sorry, Hilton : Das Verhalten Eurer Mitarbeiter zeigt, dass Ihr diesen bei der Schulung zwar viele Routinen auswendig beigebracht habt : Das Wichtigste habt Ihr aber vergessen. Ein Verhalten, das beim Check in eines Gastes nachmittags um halb fünf völlig ok sein kann, ist um 2h nachts absolut inakzeptabel. Ein trauriges Beispiel dafür, dass im Hotelmanagement heute nur noch viele Routinen auswendig gelernt werden, aber das Wichtigste vergessen wird : Was will der Gast. Versetzt Euch doch einfach mal in den Gast : der Gast, der kurz vor 1 h nachts kommt, will nichts als Ruhe und Schlaf. Wie könnt Ihr nur auf die Idee kommen, den Gast zu wecken, wenn, bedingt durch einen Fehler des Hilton Systems die Daten nicht richtig aufgenommen wurden ? By the way :Hilton hätte gegen mich sowieso eine Anspruch auf Zahlung der Übernachtung gehabt, selbst wenn ich gar nicht erschienen wäre ! Dagegen verlangt Ihr von mir, dass ich Euch vertraue, Euch mitten in der Nacht schlaftrunken meine Kreditkarte aushändige - mit dem Limit könntet Ihr 30mal soviel abzocken wie eine Übernachtung kostet (gut, ist nicht passiert - aber ich habe schon ein blödes Gefühl, wenn ich nachts einem wildfremden Mann am Zimmer meine Karte weggeben soll...). 

Dank dem Hotelmanagment und dessen nächtlicher Weckaktion habe ich daher in einer Nacht, in der mein Schlafpensum wg. mehr als einer Stunde verspätetem Flug ohnehin schon knapp war, nochmals zwei Stunden weniger geschlafen. Dass ich vom Hotel mutwillig geweckt werde, nur weil die eigenen Mitarbeiter oder das eigene System Kartendaten nichjt richtig erfasst hat, ist mir jedenfalls noch nie passiert - und wird mir hoffentlich auch nicht mehr passieren. 

Dass das Management wirklich nichts versteht, außer gelernte Routinen einzuhalten, belegt auch der Unsinn, mir als Ausgleich einen Gutschein für ein Getränk an der Hotelbart zu schenken. Was soll der Quatsch ? Ich war nur eine Nacht da, die Bar öffnet eh erst nach Check out - und abgesehen davon wäre mir nach knappem Schlaf wirklich nicht danach zumute, an der Hotelbar zu verweilen.  

Eigentlich wollte ich dem Hotel die Höchststrafe geben, ein Punkt. Dass ich es dann doch nicht tue, liegt daran, dass das Zimmer wirklich schön war (gewesen wäre...), das Frühstück sehr gut und auch die Mitarbeiter beim Frühstück wirklich freundlich. Nochmal ausprobieren werde ich das Hotel trotzdem in diesem Jahr nicht mehr; vielleicht wenn etwas Zeit vergeht und die Chancen etwas besser sind, dass Mitarbeiter nicht nur stupide Routinen, die dem Gast den Aufenthalt buchstäblich zur Qual werden lassen, abspult, sondern in der Lage sind, den simpelsten Grundsatz im Hotelmanagement zu leben : Ein Mitarbeiter, der sich ""in the shoes of the guest"" stellten kann und, bevor er seinen Katalog abarbeitet, mal kurz darüber nachdenkt, was denn wohl der Gast will (um 2 h geweckt werden will er sicher nicht - und ihn dann noch an seiner Tür zu traktieren, nachdem er sich Störungen in der Nacht klar verbeten hat, setzt eben leider noch ein negatives Moment drauf)",2,2015,11,29
120,Super Hotel an unerwartetem Platz,"Das Hilton Hotel liegt in einer kleinen Seitenstraße ist erst ca. 1 Jahr alt. Das fällt sofort auf, alles ist neu und technisch auf dem neuesten Stand. Den Aufzug kann man nur mit der Zimmerkarte benutzen (Sicherheit!!). Das Zimmer war großzügig absolut sauber und modern, funktionell und doch wohnlich eingerichtet. Das Bad ist ebenfalls auf neuestem Stand, die Dusche mit Thermostat ausgestattet. Alles Top!  WLAN funktioniert ebenfalls ausgezeichnet. Das Frühstücksbuffet lässt keine Wünsche offen, das steht keiner hungrig auf, egal was man frühstücken will! Auf jeden Fall zu empfehlen!",5,2015,11,22
120,Una piccola meraviglia di design,"Mi è capitato di prenotare qui quando ancora non avevano ancora fatto l'inaugurazione. Come posizione mi era congeniale per l'attività per cui mi stavo recando a Londra, così con mia moglie abbiamo deciso di fare questo salto nel buio.
Si trova a pochi passi dalla fermata Southwark della Jubilee ed è abbastanza semplice da raggiungere a piedi.
L'albergo è bellissimo, con una cura per il design che rasenta il maniacale. Le stanze si vede che sono nuove di zecca, avevamo preso una camera standard, ma quando siamo entrati pensavamo ci avessero fatto l'upgrade ad una executive, non oso immaginare cosa possono essere le altre stanze. Comunque la nostra era spaziosa, finemente decorata e con un bagno meraviglioso (ammesso che si preferisca la doccia alla vasca da bagno). Se proprio vogliamo trovare il pelo nell'uovo, il tè fornito nella stanza era abbastanza orribile, ma diciamo che è veramente tutto ciò che si può appuntare alla stanza, per il resto era perfetta.
Il personale è un po' inesperto, ma si può anche capire visto che hanno aperto da neanche due mesi. All'arrivo c'è stata questa buffa scena in cui io dicevo all'addetto della reception cosa deva darmi e quali informazioni mi doveva fornire. Comunque il personale è stato tutto gentilissimo e affabile, è stato un piacere avere a che fare con loro.
Ora vorrei spendere due parole sul ristorante, l'OXBO, che purtroppo ancora non ha una sua pagina qui su tripadvisor, altrimenti meriterebbe una recensione a parte. Il posto è bellissimo e il personale è gentilissimo (tra l'altro un buon numero di camerieri erano italiani). La colazione che servono è una gioia per gli occhi oltre che per il palato: la sala viene come trasformata in una elegante versione di un mercato rionale (forse ispirato al vicino Borough Market) dove tutto sembra freschissimo e buonissimo ancora prima di assaggiarlo (fatevi preparare dei waffle, sono buonissimi). Una sera siamo rimasti anche a cena, molti dei piatti sul menù sono a base di carne alla griglia, per la quale usano un forno particolare che infonde alla carne quel buon profumo di bbq. Abbiamo mangiato benissimo e siamo stati trattati benissimo. Davvero, lode a tutto lo staff che è stato ineccepibile.
In generale spero di avere nuovamente occasione di tornarci",5,2015,11,19
120,Amazing stay in London,"Hotel veramente eccellente sotto tutti i punti di vista, abbiamo scelto una stanza King junior suite di ottime dimensioni per 3 persone. 
Colazione degna del nome Hilton.
Un particolare grazie a Riccardo e Ciprian del bar con i loro magnifici coktails e simpatia. 
Un ringraziamento ad Alex Stefano e Emanuele che, con la loro simpatia e professionalità rendono  la colazione un vero piacere.
In questo caso: Hilton un nome una garanzia!!",5,2015,11,08
120,Muy buen hotel,"Este hotel esta muy bien ubicado, cercano a atracciones turísticas, las habitaciones son impecables, el personal es muy amable y servicial, la comida del restaurante es deliciosa por lo que es una buena opción para desayunar o cenar. En general es un hotel muy bonito y sin duda volvería a hospedarme en mis próximas visitas a Londres.",5,2015,10,30
120,Sehr schönes Hotel!,"Wir haben zwei Nächste im Hilton London Bankside verbracht. Das Hotel ist sehr edel und ansprechend eingerichtet, die Betten sind perfekt, sehr bequem mit sehr edler Bettwäsche. Alles ist ganz neu und sehr sauber. Die Freundlichkeit der Mitarbeiter kann man nur lobend hervorheben. Das Restaurant ist excellent, absolut zu empfehlen, lediglich die Portionen könnten vielleicht etwas größer sein, wenn man den ganzen Tag in London unterwegs war und hungrig im Restaurant eintrifft. Der Kellner im Restaurant war sehr zuvorkommend und traf genau die richtige Mitte zwischen optimalem Service, freundlichem, humorvollem Smalltalk und angemessener Distanz. Wir haben uns auch im Restaurant sehr wohlgefühlt. 

In einem Punkt möchte ich dennoch etwas Kritik äußern. Wir haben als Gold-Member kein Zimmerupgrade erhalten (wie uns von Hilton angekündigt wurde), obwohl das Hotel offensichtlich nicht ausgebucht war.",5,2015,10,25
