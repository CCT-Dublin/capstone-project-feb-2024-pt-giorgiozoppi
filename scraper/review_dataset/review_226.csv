226,Premium experience,Front desk staff and bar & restaurant staff were excellent . Our room was fairly compact but well equipped . The lobby area was a little crowded and maybe could be reconfigured to separate the incoming guests from the departing ones but in general our experience was very positive .,5,2024,10,17
226,It‚Äôs like an old wine it‚Äôs got better with age,"This is my second time staying in the fitzwilliam , in the early days they were finding their feet as you would say and boy they have done this well , the staff are so switched on , nothing is a problem even the hall porter with the eccentric moustache is a star of the foyer . 
           Our room was large with a lovely art deco feel everything there that you require to have a enjoyable time down to an umbrella the two seater was a little hard but sure the bed made up for it giving us a lovely sleep , everything was so clean even the shower and bath perfect and believe me I‚Äôve seen them all . I love the dark corridor spooky but Victorian feel as you approach the lifts again a speedy lift with clean buttons . The restaurant was lovely very oriental looking but with a lovely host James , needs a hoover now and again but still nice , my food was ok, my steak was slightly over cooked but I ate it and said nothing , the cocktail was nice too as was the price , a cheeky 12 % service charge was added but sure it saved me hoking out some cash for the tip . 
           Breakfast was delivered to our room on time and hot we got one butter between the two of us but the girl quickly delivered more , breakfast again was good , potato bread was just ok but the rest was lovely (¬£56) 
           Altogether this hotel has settled into the Belfast city as good as the most bombed hotel  just up the street and it is 5 starred too , definitely a treat to stay , but if you want looked after this is the hotel bang smack in the middle of Belfast ps if you say to the porter he‚Äôll get you discount on your overnight parking across the street .",5,2023,12,07
226,Family time,"We had such an amazing weekend away
 From start to finish. Everyone we came in contact with was absolutely positive and kind. 
We want to thank The american woman trisha for all the kind things she did for our girls. They absolutely loved her. 
We can't wait for our next visit at christmas time ",5,2024,10,16
226,Great Hotel,"Super hotel. We thoroughly enjoyed our overnight stay, had a lovely evening meal and a fantastic breakfast the next day.  The room was beautifully and tastefully furnished providing everything you could want for an overnight stay. Will definitely be staying again.",5,2024,10,14
226,Downtown hotel with no hitches!,"Four-night stay with no problems and excellent feelings on service.  Great central location right beside the Belfast Opera House.  Concierges were great, always there and helpful in every way!  Used the valet parking with no hitches.  Easy to get to the main highway from the hotel.  Breakfast was first class with a hot meal menu selection along with a big buffet bar.  Room was clean and roomy, nice bathroom with excellent glassed in shower.  Did not have dinner at the hotel...",5,2024,10,14
226,Stylish Belfast hotel,"Modern and stylish hotel.  Centrally located in Belfast.  Nice room, comfortable bed and good shower.  Regularly travel and have stayed in some great hotels, but the Fitzwilliam was a bit underwhelming and expensive for what it is. Breakfast was a pricey extra and bar drinks and food were really dear.  Staff were professional but it all felt quite corporate and transactional, so didn't get an especially warm, friendly or human vibe. Overall a swanky hotel - but style over substance?",3,2024,10,14
226,Excellence all around,Excellent food all 3 courses. Great chefs who deserve to be complimented. Great service from a very professional team. Very friendly and approachable in terms of service and attentive.  Customer service excellent. Drinks a good size and great variety.,5,2024,10,12
226,The Fitz,Very nice food and service! The menu was limited but contained a great selection. Wine list was very good. Overall a very nice experience. Nnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnn 200 is the minimum which is too many,5,2024,10,12
226,Two nights in Belfast - not as restful as they should have been‚Ä¶..,"Very comfortable hotel with great bedding and location. 
A nicer experience than FW Dublin. 
Problem was twi fire alarms in one night - 0310 and 0530 with no written distributed apology to guests for technical problem. A short note to all staying would have sufficed.",4,2024,10,12
226,"Good, not great","Great central location, eco friendly and clean room with nice linens.  If you like firm pillows and soft mattress, you will sleep well, although the busy street can be noisy at night. Small rooms with no luggage  rack so our suitcases ended up on the floor.  The drapes were torn at the top and didn‚Äôt close, allowing light to filter in.  Not a 5 star hotel.",4,2024,10,11
226,Excellent Service,Our stay was very comfortable . The hotels staff was very much accommodative to our family needs. The rooms were nice and the location excellent . I would like to put a word of appreciation for the lady Brady at the front desk for all her support and cooperation during our stay. I would definitely like to stay at this hotel if I ever travel again to Belfast,5,2024,10,11
226,Short break,"It was a great break, lovely food, great service. Breakfast and dinner were excellent. Belfast is a great city to visit. Fitzwilliam hotel is close to everything. Everything was as described and we would go back again to this hotel. 5 star üåü",5,2024,10,11
226,Loved This One!,"My husband and I stayed in an executive king suite at the end of August. We arrived there from Dublin by bus because the railroads were undergoing improvements. The hotel was a very quick walk (less than five minutes) from the bus drop-off. 

Our room, an executive king, was well-appointed, with a comfortable bed and pillows, a sofa, large bathroom with tub, writing desk, and all the expected amenities. There was a turn-down service in the evening with chocolates left on the pillows. The view out the window was of the street with hill country visible in the distance. 

The Fitzwilliam is next door to a beautiful opera house, but make sure you get your tickets ahead of time if you're planning to attend a play. The hotel is also surrounded by beautiful Victorian architecture and is a half-hour walk to the harbour and Titanic Experience. 

There's a great restaurant, Harlem, right around the corner. Inside the hotel, we enjoyed breakfast, in-room dining, and dinner in the bar, and all were very good, with excellent service. The hotel sets several tables in the lobby for high tea. We didn't have time to try it, but it looked lovely. 

If we ever return to Belfast, we'll definitely revisit this place!",5,2024,10,07
226,"Fabulous hotel, will definitely visit again","Beautiful hotel. Couldn‚Äôt find fault with it! 
Everything by we used was luxurious, such a treat! 
Beds were comfortable, the bathrooms were exquisite. We had lovely products to use. Turndown and evening choccies were a nice treat, as was the regular cleaning and refill of tea station in our room. 
Fabulous!",5,2024,10,07
226,Don't judge a book by the cover,Not what I would expect from a 5 star hotel. Staff were lovely and the bed very comfortable however room not totally clean- cobwebs on the ceiling and dirty glasses were left in the bathroom- although replaced promptly when staff were made aware.,3,2024,10,06
226,Perfect Stay!,"An absolutely faultless stay. Rooms, food, cocktails and staff are all superb.
Loved everything about it. Not often you find an establishment that has it all.
Can't recommend enough and will be back soon.
Big shout out to Lauren and Trisha,",5,2024,10,01

226,Holiday Fitzwilliam Belfast September,"The hotel was clean and comfortable and the staff friendly and attentive
Excellent location for everything",5,2024,09,30
226,Great Location in Belfast,Enjoyed our stay while in Belfast. Central and walkable to all sites of the city. Bar offered great dinner options since hard to find simple pub food after 8 on a Monday night without going to a full restaurant. Staff at the concierge desk very welcoming and friendly.,4,2024,09,29
226,"Great hotel, with an attentive helpful staff.","Hotel room was extremely nice, everything first rate. Staff were extremely helpful. The bar was nice. The hotel's restaurant was awful. Avoid the restaurant: much better food is available anywhere else you'd choose to eat. ",5,2024,09,28
226,Exceptional experience again. ,"Exceptional experience again in the Fitzwilliam. Beautiful room and amazing service. Cannot be beaten in Belfast. We had lunch in the bar and it was gorgeous as well as the breakfast. Can't fault the staff at all, from service to the quality.
 We will definitely be back. The extra birthday treat was very welcoming. ‚ù§Ô∏è",5,2024,09,28
226,Review from Canada,"Our hotel stay was awesome. The rooms were beautiful and staff went head over heels to make us happy. Brian crozier server was exceptional.the food was fabulous and breakfast very yummy  We can‚Äôt wait to come back. Thanks again. 
The gang from Canada.",5,2024,09,27
226,Not quite 5 star,"We were on a driving tour of Ireland with friends and were staying for two nights. We chose this hotel because it had  a good city centre location and secure valet parking which was a bit expensive at ¬£28 per night. We had a large well equipped room and the bathroom had a bath and walk in shower but with a heated towel rail that didn't work. The bar and lounge area were excellent and worthy of a 5 star hotel. We ate in the restaurant on our first night. The menu was very limited, rather like you expect from a pub rather than a 5 star hotel. The food was good but the service erratic with not all our dishes arriving together. Breakfast provided a very limited cold buffet with packet cereals. However, hot food was freshly cooked and served but again the service was hit and miss and in particular they were unable to supply an alternative to butter for one of our group who needed dairy free. The hotel appeared to have staffing issues because when we came to leave there was only one concierge on duty to transport luggage for guests and handle the valet parking so we all had to wait some time. Overall, there were too many little issues that meant we didn't feel we had 5 star experience.",4,2024,09,27
226,Great hotel.,My stay was perfect except for breakfast which was a bit disappointing and not to the standard of the rest of the hotel,4,2024,09,26
226,Useful central location,Perfectly adequate hotel. Friendly staff and having a concierge service was really lovely. The bathroom and hotel room was definitely pretty but the layout of the hotel room wasn‚Äôt very well thought through. The bathtubs could also be slightly bigger/ longer. Overall a nice experience and convenient for a work trip!,4,2024,09,26
226,"Perfect, stress free stay at the Fitzwilliam.","As a returning guest our return to the Fitzwilliam was as wonderful as expected. From the moment we arrived until leaving, the staff were impeccable. Catriona on Reception helped us with business papers that needed printing taking any stress away and organising taxis etc. The room was perfect. We enjoyed the Afternoon Tea which was served by the most charming waiter, introducing the menu and ensuring every detail of set up and service was 5 star. 
Only minor point that we thought could be improved was the music in the bar area.
Thank you to the Fitzwilliam!",5,2024,09,26
226,Wonderful stay,"Wonderful experience! We loved every minute of our stay there. Each member of the staff we spoke to were helpful and friendly , especially the concierges. All of them went out of their way to answer our questions and offer suggestions to places we wanted to see. Well worth it.",5,2024,09,25
226,"Great, if expensive hotel in the heart of the city with friendly staff","Spent 3 nights at the Fitzwilliam with my parents and sister for a family weekend in Belfast.

Hotel is well located, staff are very attentive and detail orientated - greeting us by name at check in for example. 
Rooms are spacious for a city hotel, temperature easily controlable and well appointed with Nespresso coffee machines, kettles with a good supply of tea and milks. Bathroom had a great walk in shower with toiletries and sufficient towels.

My room was facing the back side of the hotel away from the road, so no road noise was heard at all.

Restaurant offer a good selection of foods although can be quite expensive for what you get. But staff are extremely friendly.
Bar is well stocked and again extremely friendly and able to make any drink you may desire. The bar was a little dark and the booths quite narrow - so watch your knees getting in.

All in all, we had a really nice stay in Belfast, and I understand you get what you pay for - but this was a very expensive stay.",4,2024,09,25
226,Comfort & Convenience at the Fitz,"Friendly, helpful staff. Delicious food & drink. Luxurious rooms. Centrally located. I will be back!",5,2024,09,24
226,I would recommend,"The luxury end of hotels, therefore quite expensive.  The chateaubriand steak was outstanding.  Staff were all most pleasant and helpful ",5,2024,09,24
226,Worth every penny,"What a fantastic hotel with great service and quality food and drinks choices.

From being greeted at checkin by BOTH my and my wife‚Äôs first names to being welcomed at dinner and breakfast in the same manner.
We were celebrating an anniversary overnight stay and they acknowledged this in our room with a card and some sweet treats.

Service was excellent at every point of interface from reception to concierge to bar to restaurant.

Premium price but well worth it. Breakfast is another level! Looking forward to our return in February 2025 for the Snow Patrol concert.",5,2024,09,23
226,Worth every penny!,"Fantastic quality hotel with top service, food and drink.
Everything about our stay was made special. I cannot recommend highly enough! You pay a premium but it‚Äôs IMO the best hotel in Belfast by a country mile.",5,2024,09,23
226,Attention to detail required,"As the title says, very poor room servicing and housekeeping. Not a 5 star hoter but could be if more attention to detail was used.",3,2024,09,23
226,A class act,"I tend to prefer the small/boutique over the large corporate, but the Fitzwilliam did its best to be personal. Location is great, all the good stuff is within easy walking distance. The ""glider"" (made to look like a tram but in reality, just an articulated bus) which goes to the Titanic Experience runs from a couple of blocks away.

Check-in was a breeze, and valet parking took away any concern about leaving the car. The rooms were very decent, with every facility one could possibly want, and very little noise ingress (other than a little from the street). Lovely touches like a candle and matches by the bath, so I could have a romantic soak by myself! The bar was very decent with good service but no decent cider.

All the staff were chatty, pleasant and efficient and clearly well motivated. Huge choice for breakfast, and the quality reasonable if a bit ""conveyor belt"". Fruit juice was rather ""budget"" - nothing freshly squeezed. At ¬£400 a night, these little things do matter. They still do a turn down service, which is cute and rather rare these days.

The building is not as new as it looks. Obviously refurbed in the recent past, little things like the shaky, clonky lifts and positively ancient looking air con control give the game away. Overall, it did provide a 5 star service and we thoroughly enjoyed our 3 nights here.",5,2024,09,22
226,Wonderful hotel,I will highly recommend the Fitzwilliam to anyone headed to Belfast. Accommodations were perfect and within walking distance to wonderful dining and pubs. ,5,2024,09,22
226,Best Hotel(& staff) Ever,"Quite simply the best hotel we‚Äôve been to. Lovely surroundings, amazing staff & ideal location. 
We ate in the bar & the food was lovely, lots of choice for breakfast too.  Cocktails to die for too
Thank you Fitzwilliams for making our break a real treat!",5,2024,09,22
226,"The Fitzwilliam Hotel Belfast, Fantastic, Fabulous & Fancy","Amazing stay, Amazing Hotel, Amazing Staff. If you are visiting Belfast The Fitzwilliam is the place to stay. All the staff we met were professional, friendly and made us feel welcome from check-in to departure.

226,Belfast Leg of Ireland Trip,"Golf and seeing the Irish Open. Great city to walk around in, check out Cathedral District for bars and food. Great people watching!",4,2024,09,18
226,A bit of class in Belfast,"Stayed for 3 nights at the beginning of September 2024.

The check-in process as easy and informative.

We were allocated room 711 - executive double with views towards the Leonardo, Hotel City Hall and beyond. 

The room as expected was well appointed ‚Äì with lots of furniture ‚Äì a big comfy bed - side tables ‚Äì a sofa with side tables ‚Äì a desk with chair ‚Äì a Samsung 43inch TV on a stand - not wall mounted and therefore takes up room space - lots of cushions - cupboard with fridge - kettle for hot drinks - cafetiere ‚Äì a wardrobe with hanging space in corridor to bathroom - iron and board - bathroom - compact but with enough room for a separate bath and large walk-in shower - good flow and control - body and hair products in dispensers.

Excellent WiFi 100 megabits+ - only one usb plug - a radio - and 2 phones - latter not sure why and why 2? ‚Äì the room was well lit, and the curtains kept the light out. 

There was a turndown service that replaced towels and replenished teas coffee and sugars and left a little box with 2 chocolates. 

There was a very controllable air conditioning, however the controls were hidden in a dark corner, and you need a torch to read and alter settings. In addition, the window opened.

The hotel is in a very central location with the drawback that it can be noisy mainly from traffic and sirens, but we also encountered noise from weekend revellers including one who gave a stirring rendition of God Save the King at 4.00 am.
 
There was a fire alarm at 7.25 on Monday morning that proved to be a false alarm.

We opted out of breakfast @¬£20 per head - so this review is based on the room which was comfortable and well appointed ‚Äì we slept well ‚Äì if a bit cluttered ‚Äì the hotel is well located ‚Äì strangely the only interaction with staff we could recall was at check-in ‚Äì I don‚Äôt think we were ignored it was more likely they didn‚Äôt intrude - but good value? not quite for me - but the hotel does not disappoint - thank you",4,2024,09,18
226,Fantastic hotel in great location,"What a lovely hotel in a great central location. Staff were extremely helpful. Room was great with a really comfy bed. Breakfast offered great choices with both continental and freshly cooked food available. We also tried lunch and dinner, both were excellent. The Fitzwilliam is highly recommended.",5,2024,09,18

Great location to visit all that Belfast has to offer..",5,2024,09,18
226,The Fitzwilliam Belfast,"Great location.. the rooms are very luxurious & clean , I personally love the executive king rooms, very spacious bathrooms and with tub & shower. The staff are very professional, polite & helpful. The food is good although at times the lobby restaurant lacks consistency, but in general it‚Äôs good with a nice simple variety. 
Definitely one of my favorite places in Belfast",5,2024,09,17

226,The restaurant team are second to none. ,"As someone who works in hospitality, particularly the F&B side,l the restaurant team at the Fitzwilliam are second to none. Bakesh was the standout star, attentive, friendly accommodating, he would be an asset to any restaurant team. This was our second visit to the hotel and there will be a third. ",5,2024,09,03
226,Very Poor Experience,"Front desk staff weren't particularly friendly. They also promised to call me when my room was ready. I didn't receive any call. The room was average but was very warm and the AC was poor. The fire alarm went off at 11:30pm causing mayhem throughout the whole hotel. Nobody knew if it was real or not. It ended up being a false alarm but no announcements were made by staff. It happened again TWICE the next morning! Again, no announcements or apologies. I won't be staying here again.",2,2024,09,01

226,Beautiful experience,"We had an excellent stay at this hotel last night. So beautiful we booked to stay for new year's eve too! Everything from start to finish was lovely. Super impressed with the room, very clean, we were also given an upgrade which was great! 9th floor, views from the bed was lovely. I was able to lie this morning with my coffee and looking out. Great stay I must say! However we got to service dinner as we were in a rush to get ready in the evening and it wasn't great. But we enjoyed everything else. Cocktails are amazing and staff were brilliant
 Can't wait to get another night away here.",5,2024,08,30
226,Decent : staff very helpful.,"Nice hotel.  Good location and staff friendly and helpful.  Just don‚Äôt see it as a 5 star hotel.  Stayed a week at the end of august.  
Some little things like no draw space, coffees and teas in a tight cubby hole, comp dressing gowns didn‚Äôt have belt loops etc.   nothing major but just the small touches that can make all the difference.  Would come again if the price was right but open to alternatives.",3,2024,08,29
226,"Great Experience / clean, friendly, convenient","Just found their business card and promised I would write a review after they took such good care of us.  Traveling with family, wife and two teenagers - just did the overnight flight from the states to Dublin and drove straight to Belfast.  We were at the Fitzwilliam around 8:00am, well before check-in, they were gracious and stored our bags and parked our car as we headed off to the Titanic experience.  Unfortunately my son started feeling bad while we were at the Titanic and we had to head back to the hotel around 10:00am.  I spoke with Caitriona Weir at their front desk hoping one of our two reserved rooms would be available to get my boy into bed for a nap but neither of our rooms were available and she wasn't sure when a room would open up.  She asked me to wait a minute and see what she could do and she was able to upgrade us to one of their residences (ours was on the 8th floor) and check us in right away.  1) much thanks, our son slept for 4 hours and was out with us that night for dinner which would not have happened without Caitriona 2) the residence is a great product, basically a two bedroom apartment with a great view of the city.  I remember seeing it on the website and passing on it, but if I were to book again I would grab it.  The hotel is conveniently located, clean, friendly, and I strongly recommend.",5,2024,08,28
226,Great location and staff,"A very central hotel with excellent staff, all of whom couldn't have been more helpful. Slept very soundly in a room with a superb city view. High enough floor (9th) to not have to worry about any noise. Excellent breakfast with good range of items off a menu as well as buffet.
Would come again",5,2024,08,27
226,"Great service, excellent cocktails and a very good night's sleep","The staff were professional, friendly and helpful. I loved the vibe in the bar (late on a Thursday night) and the bartenders actually know what they're doing when it comes to classic cocktails (the house Negroni with Jawbox gin was the best Negroni that I've had in a long timne). But what really made my stay great was the room - it was very clean, well laid out, quiet and the bed was really comfortable.",5,2024,08,27

226,Nice spot,"This hotel is centrally located in Belfast city. Any staff encounters were professional and courteous. I was kindly upgraded upon checkin which was a nice surprise.

226,Great restaurant,Food was amazing great atmosphere. Such an amazing setting. High quality food for a very reasonable price. Located in the heat of Belfast what more could you ask for! I am yet to stay in one of the rooms but the restaurant is top notch! You will not be disappointed,5,2024,08,26

226,Home Away From Home,"In the centre of downtown Belfast with easy access to the Titanic, Cathedral and Victoria Square areas, the Fitzwilliam was a haven for these tired travelers.  Gavin, the concierge, seemed to be at his post every time we needed something and he always engaged in friendly banter whenever we arrived at or left from the hotel.  The desk staff were friendly and helpful, if not engaging and the bar/dining room was inviting and the food was delicious.",4,2024,08,25
226,Elegant,"I loved nearly everything about this hotel. The rooms are beautiful and well designed. The bathroom is lovely and ours had a separate bath and shower, which was great. Only problem is there is no where for the toiletry bags. Room was spacious and a bit glamorous and plenty of spots for our suitcases - practical and beautiful. I didn‚Äôt love the hot breakfast though, and it was a struggle to get served. Otherwise loved our stay.",5,2024,08,25
226,Wonderful Stay with the most helpful and knowledgeable Concierge team,"We booked only 2 months in advance for August.  I had never been to Belfast so I wrote the conceirge for recommendations.  They supplied a lovely listing.   I asked for several tours which they set up with a fantastic guide.  I asked for their Crafternoon Tea and their head concierge, Gerard, made it happen.  I had many questions and they were always responsive and positive.  It made being first time in Belfast, fun and quite easy.  The hotel room was luxurious and comforting.    Everyone who worked there was helpful, kind and professional.   And the breakfast was a Must!     ",5,2024,08,21
226,"Not a 5 star, extremely noisy.","We went to a 5 star hotel as parents that come away for a relaxing  night away and spent the night Kept awake by the sound of people and cars/sirens outside all night and then when your exhausted enough to fall asleep at 6am the smoke alarm goes off on 3 different occasions! Breakfast was just OK, however staff looked so miserable.  So far from a 5 star experience. I thought the factvthey supplied ear plugs was strange, however i now understand, Do not stay unless your heavy sleeper. ",2,2024,08,20
226,Great traditional luxury hotel with traditional hotel services,"Beautiful hotel in great location in Belfast.  We love that it still has the traditional hotel services (such as daily room make up, nightly turn down services with boxes of chocolates, just to name a few).  The bar downstairs was a great place to relax at the end of the day because it was not noisy like other pubs or hotel bars.  We ended up going there 3 times during the 3 night stay.  Will stay here again when we go back to Belfast.",5,2024,08,19

This was my first time staying in the fitzwilliam and I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôd stay anywhere else in Belfast now.
They parked my car for me and brought it back to me the next day, right outside the front door. 
The rooms are absolute luxury and the attention to detail is unreal.
They even leave matches in the bathroom to light the candle beside the bath. 
The toiletries smell gorgeous too.
I can‚Äôt fault this place, will definitely be back!",5,2024,08,12

226,Afternoon tea,Afternoon tea was excellent. Everything was explained to us in detail and nothing was too much trouble. We attended a while ago as a couple on the day of the Belfast marathon so for the majority of the experience we were the only two there. This only meant that it felt exclusive to us and very fast service. I assume this is always the case though regarding service. Will be back.,5,2024,08,09

226,Perfection,"Excellent experience! We arrived a little early for our 2 night stay, and whilst our room on the 2nd floor was available, our request to have a room on a higher floor was met with a smile and an explanation that a wait would be required. The lobby was very comfortable and we waited until checkin time of 3pm. We were allocated a 6th floor room and headed upstairs, however this room was still being cleaned. Back to reception, who apologised profusely and provided us with vouchers for a cocktail each in the bar. Room 711 exceeded our expectations, and was spacious and very well appointed. Every interaction with the staff was cordial and the customer service was outstanding. We took up the offer of a drink in the bar, which came with a complimentary plate of snacks, which we enjoyed whilst watching the Olympics coverage. So much so, that we had dinner in the bar on our second night which we thoroughly enjoyed. We highly recommend the Fitzwilliam.",5,2024,08,05

The staff were all very friendly and attentive and really made the stay special. 
The room was very comfortable, albeit there was a light at only one side of the bed.
We ate dinner there and were made very welcome. The food was well presented and delicious.

226,Great stay in central Belfast.,This hotel is one of the best I have stayed in. The room is large (standard room) with a big bathroom with both free standing shower and bath. There is even a candle to light beside the bath. The king size bed is very comfortable and faces the large window. There is a turndown service in the evening when a small box of chocolates is left. Two complimentary small bottles of wine are in the room fridge to enjoy. Overall a very good experience for a reasonable price.,5,2024,07,28
226,Very comfortable five star Hotel with excellent guest care.,"Excellent service, room and hotel. This was my second time staying and both times I had a great experience. The rooms are very comfortable. ",5,2024,07,26
226,Great location shame about the decor. ,"We were allocated this hotel for one night prior to our cruise with Regent seven seas.
The location is excellent and the staff were friendly and efficient. 
However we were disappointed with the small reception area and lack of simple coffee bar to entertain visitors we were meeting up with.
We also did not like our 7th floor room. This had no view from the window,  and although comfortable it has appalling decor- the interior designer must have been having a nightmare. See example in attached photo. 
OK for one night. Good breakfast. ",3,2024,07,24
226,Fantastic,I was with my brother in this fantastic restaurant. Thak you so much for the wonderful food it was an amazing dinner today. Service of Bikash was wonderful and the bar lady down stair‚Äôs was a person to remember (sorry I forgot her name). We will be back again.,5,2024,07,23
226,One night was long enough,"This hotel is just average. Bathrobes left out were discoloured, creased and rough.  Too uncomfortable to use. Went to bar for drink and was told it was table service only but there were no empty tables. Went into lobby and asked about getting a drink out there and was told they'd get someone to take order. Twenty minutes later still no one came so Went back to reception where it was obvious they had forgotten about us. Told them we'd go out of hotel and get drink elsewhere.  Would not recommend this hotel to anyone.",3,2024,07,21

226,Not the 5-star experience we hoped for.,Not a family friendly hotel. The family rooms include a pull out sofa bed that was not equipped with bedding. We had to request it and fit it ourselves. Bathroom counter space was tiny. Window in our 7th floor room was almost full length which seemed extremely dangerous with children and a large potential drop below. Service was professional and polite. Breakfast was ok. ,3,2024,07,18
226,Lovely hotel,"This is an excellent hotel. Staff go the extra mile to see everything is perfect. Great breakfast and dinner, and top quality rooms.",5,2024,07,17

Would definitely recommend hotel as location was central to Belfast City and shops, transport, restaurants and bars on hand.",5,2024,07,17
226,Super impressed,"Was skeptical and didn‚Äôt know what to expect, as advertised may not always be the reality.

But I was super impressed with everything, yes everything. From the moment you enter, super friendly stuff, that greet with a big smile and warm welcome.

Restaurant staff don‚Äôt disappoint as well, they also very patient, smiling and make you feel the premium experience of the hotel.

Room staff, wow, the bedding is well kept and the room is serviced more than once a day. At night you greeted by a gown by your bed side along with a remote, water and chocolate snack right where you would want it place them yourself.  

You can ignore the below nitpicking: they should shut down the gym, I‚Äôm big on gym and knew hotel gyms are bad, but oh my word. But doesn‚Äôt take away from the experience as I went out for a run with the sun in my face and saw the city.",5,2024,07,16
226,Exceptional experience üí´,"Having stayed in The Fitzwilliam with my husband in 2018, we were delighted to have the opportunity to return with our 4 year old daughter. 

From making initial contact with reception (an SOS at 10am due to a water issue in our current accommodation), the staff could not have been more helpful. They were able to accommodate us at really short notice with a 12.30pm check-in, which was amazing. 

We were greeted by the nicest concierge team, then the receptionist who had been really helpful on the phone couldn't have been nicer when we arrived. 

We had the most beautiful room, set up with an extra bed for our daughter, so she was delighted! She was also delighted with the pencils and paper provided and had great fun entertaining herself in the room üòÄ 

Every single staff member we interacted with took the time to speak to our daughter which really made her day(s) and such a nice touch. 
We had breakfast in the hotel which was absolutely delicious, and again, all the staff were incredibly helpful and attentive. 

Nothing was too much bother, everybody couldn't do enough for you, it was just amazing. My only regret is we weren't there for longer, but we WILL be back! 

Thank you all ‚ù£Ô∏è",5,2024,07,16

226,Deserves a 5 star,"Great hotel, service and cleanliness. I‚Äôve only scored it down due to a bar man with poor tact. A misunderstanding but obviously no thought process in how he could of got to the same result more tactfully, avoiding my embarrassment which in fairness was very short as the matter was resolved immediately.",4,2024,07,16
226,"Fabulous, friendly Fitzwilliam",This is the hotel for grown ups to stay at when in Belfast.  We stayed on the 9th floor with great views over the city.

226,Exceptional Hotel,"Exceptional service from the moment we drove up.  Everyone was super attentive and accommodating.  The lobby is beautiful.  The floors are somewhat dark, when you get off of the elevator.  Our room was lovely with a nice view.  It, including the bathroom, was very clean, but could use an additional shelf or 2 in the bathroom.  There were only phone charging ports on one side of the bed.  Brian, a bartender / waiter / maitre'd was extremely helpful, warm and engaging. Although when Brian was not around,  things seemed to slow down in the restaurant/bar.",5,2024,07,11
226,Brilliant experience,"We had such a lovely stay.  Comfiest bed ever.  Friendliness and warmth of staff was stand out.  Can't wait to go back.  Will be our go to hotel in Belfast in future.

The hotel was well appointed, with a lovely sitting area on the ground floor. Our room was great - very comfortable bed, lots of available power outlets, etc. Go for the breakfast buffet if you can - we loved it. The selection of food was stellar, and the service was excellent. If you're driving, there is a parking garage across the street (same block) that costs less than the valet option at the hotel for overnight guests. The hotel will also provide parking validation for the parking garage. The hotel is conveniently located near retail and restaurants.",5,2024,07,09

226,Beautiful Belfast Bolthole,"I had a two night weekend stay in this fantastic city centre hotel. From arrival I was made to feel welcome and looked after - my luggage was carried to my room and I was given great suggestions by the hotel staff (including a free city map) about things to do in the city. My room was gorgeous, well-appointed, a great size, with perfect refreshments and toiletries. There were lovely touches like free mints, wine, and the use of an umbrella - plus a lovely robe to use. The shower was great quality. I had blissful sleep in the huge and comfortable beds. Air con meant the ambient room temperature was always good. The hotel is in a great location, within 30mins walking distance of all the shopping districts, and St George's indoor market - a slightly longer walk along the river took me to the fantastic Titanic Exhibition. The bar is great, with complimentary nibbles provided. Breakfast was superb, with a wonderful variety of hot and cold food, all freshly prepared and very tasty. I would highly recommend this hotel.",5,2024,07,05

226,Crafternoon Tea,"Just had Crafternoon Tea today. Food was delicious and staff were impeccable! Very attentive and courteous at all times.

Upon our arrival, we were greeted at the entrance of the hotel with the concierge waiting to help us with our bags and to point us in the right direction to check in.  The room was slightly small, but we had plenty of space for our needs.  Our room was clean as well.  The location of the hotel is excellent as well.

226,Perfect in every way,"From the moment of arrival to checkout we were treated like VIPs. The attention to detail was amazing and every encounter with a staff member was exactly what it should be - knowledgeable, respectful and considerate.

226,"OK, but not 5 stars","Not 5 star standard in my opinion. The rooms were decent, the staff were nice, but e.g. the comfort in the lobby was nothing to brag about. When half of the seats are ""reserved"" for hours for one reason or another, you don't think about those arriving or checking out. They have no place to sit down because the seats are ""occupied"". The hotel should definitely upgrade the lobby.",3,2024,06,29

226,Hello. I stayed with yourselves on 21st June for my partners birthday it was a long awaited break for ourselves and on a,"Hello.
I stayed with yourselves on 21st June for my partners birthday it was a long awaited break for ourselves and on arrival to the room it wasn't what we expected nor the standard of cleanliness what we received on our previous first stay. We carefully selected your hotel as recommend by a family member as my partner suffers from OCD and struggles with staying out of her home. Anyway there was a long dark hair lying on the bedroom pillow and also hair in the bathroom sink. There were sticky residue on the bedside lockers and the final straw before reporting to reception was hair in the glass provided in the room. Thankfully staff members sorted a new room for us while we ate in your restaurant which was beautiful and gave one guest a complimentary breakfast. However I did feel the need to bring this to your attention and this totally disrupted our stay and my partners mood to celebrate her birthday and relax as the experience made her question the cleanliness and quality of your hotel.",3,2024,06,24
226,Excellent food in the bar at lunchtime,"Excellent food in the bar last week,  best panini ever, really good bread and excellent soup! Very friendly and efficient staff ..Good location convenient  to bus and train stations, good multi story parking just across the road..

226,Best overall service,"Had my birthday meal, the chateau Briand was phenomenal, cooked to our liking, the chips and Yorkshire side where for both parties sharing not just one sitting. What made the meal extra special was the complementary birthday dessert. A special mention to Sarah who was very attentive and quick to help us with our drinks orders. The Fitzwilliam staff never fail to make our visit special.",5,2024,06,22
226,Beautiful Hotel,Stunning hotel with friendly staff a really luxury feel. In the city centre perfect location. Lovely wee touches in the room. ,5,2024,06,22
226,Excellent location and comfortable,Excellent hotel in a very central area. Complimentary wine and treat in room on arrival and water left in the car on leaving is a nice touch. Staff were excellent - friendly and accommodating. Dinner was good. Breakfast I think could be better quality for a 5 star establishment. ,4,2024,06,22
226,A fantastic base in a vibrant city,"A truly 5 star hotel.  Reception was speedy, friendly and efficient and our room was a junior suite which was spacious with a wonderful double aspect. We didn't have breakfast (Harlem, just 5 mins away was lovely) but spent many happy hours in the bar and a big shout out here to Brian and Orrie whos superb service and friendly chat made it so enjoyable.  ",5,2024,06,21
226,Business trip turned favorite hotel,"This was my second trip to the hotel and it's now the only place I'll stay in Belfast. Its high-end, but not presumptuous. Its clean, welcoming and an amazing location central to everything in Belfast. I will be making this my home away from home while in Blefast. ",5,2024,06,19
226,Avoid.,"Dirty, dark, and staff who are very friendly, but don‚Äôt have a clue. Blood stained bedding, clothes dumped about the room by housekeeping, broken coffee machine plus air conditioning and Wi-Fi that don‚Äôt work are not what I expect from somewhere billed as 5 star and charging over ¬£300/night.

I had originally planned to give this two stars, simply for the lovely check-in lady but after finding over ¬£2000 fraudulently removed from my credit card you can guess why I removed it! No-one answers the phone, so not sure how this is going to be resolved.

I was able to take my beautiful mum to sparkling afternoon tea at the fitzwilliam hotel and it was amazing! From the staff, to the food, the whole experience was amazing! We couldn‚Äôt believe how tasty the food was and how much food we got! Truly one of the best afternoon teas we had been to and we‚Äôve been to quite a few across Northern Ireland. Judith and terry were fab hosting our table and even gave mum a lovely 60th birthday surprise! Thank you so much and for gifting us the tickets to see pretty woman in the grand opera house as part of the competition. A fab day we will never forget. We will definitely be back and would recommend sparkling afternoon tea at the fitzwilliam to all our friends. Thank you again.",5,2024,06,17

226,Just ok therefore very overpriced.,"Good location and nothing really wrong. But the whole experience is bland, dark, smallish, noisy, slightly aged, uninspiring. Feels massively overpriced as it was very expensive stay. This is no 5 star hotel.",2,2024,06,15
226,Excellent stay!,Immaculate hotel and room with very comfortable beds (matress and pillows especially) as well as black out curtains. Spacious and dimmable lights that give a comfortable ambient after a long day. Extremely clean and tidy. ,5,2024,06,14

226,Lovely hotel with an air of old-fashioned glamour complemented by mod-cons.,"Lovely, friendly hotel with an old fashioned glamour. Everything about it is comfortable - the staff are excellent and it's spotlessly clean. In a fantastic location for local transport, restaurants and things to do and see. Highly recommend for a city break.",5,2024,06,09
226,Great location for your Belfast stay.,"Firstly, I want the hotel to know we really enjoyed our stay and thought the hotel was in a great location close to the city centre, clean, comfortable and the staff incredibly friendly and helpful.  We would certainly consider coming back and would recommend it to others.
However, it is meant to be a 5 star hotel and we felt overall it was a little tired in places and needs a bit of work to keep it at that standard.
Our room was comfortable but on arrival: the fridge did not work, the drinks inside were warm, the clock radio did not tune, the TV remote was difficult to use and the air conditioning was tempermental. Having said this, we contacted the hotel team and they rectified these snags quickly and efficiently but my point is that this is a 5 star hotel and these issues should not arise in the first place.
On the plus side, breakfast is very good, dinner was good although the vegetables a little cold,  the lounge is small but comfortable and the cosierge team really friendly and helpful.
On Saturday night the bar had a fantastic music act on (a violinist and guitarist playing contemporary music with an Irish twist). We sat and enjoyed the music and watched the bar staff beaver away making cocktails. A fabulous evening!
As I say, a lovely hotel in a great location and we had a great time. They just need focus on the little niggles and it will truly be a 5 Star hotel.",4,2024,06,09
226,A short stay in Belfast,"A very good, city centre hotel with committed, cheerful and helpful staff a highlight.

226,Superb staff,Every single member of staff from reception and concierge to bar and restaurant deserves a mention. They are all super welcoming and friendly and cannot do enough for you. The hotel is in a great location for city exploring and the rooms and breakfasts are really good. Unfortunately we could not get our air conditioning/heating or television to do what we wanted whilst we were in the room and gave up on them both but loved the evening turndown service.,4,2024,06,07

226,Ahmed - 10/10,"Ahmed was amazing - he was our only server all night. He was patient with our orders for over 20 guests, as prompt as possible with all drink deliveries despite being in his own , and friendly at all times. Hopefully for other nights there are more staff on to help!",5,2024,06,01

226,Not 5 star,Lovely position but noisy. Staff very helpful. Food and drink expensive. Meant to be 5 star but small issues made more like a 4. Still had a good stay,4,2024,05,29
226,OK place to stay in Belfast,"We booked the Fitzwilliam at the very last minute as I had mistakenly booked the wrong dates at another hotel that had no space, and we needed a place to sleep. Thankfully the Fitz had a room for us so we were grateful to have a roof - and a nice one at that. 

The hotel is large and fairly modern. The executive king we had was a good size, and was quiet and comfortable for our one night stay. 

The front desk staff are professional. The concierge on checkout was quite cold when we asked to store our bags. The price was quite high for the product but I did book at the very last minute so I wasn't surprised.

I will note that on check in, I had a bit of a disappointing experience that started when the gentleman told me he would be taking a photocopy of my passport. I found this odd as it's very rare to be asked for ID in hotels in Europe, let alone taking a copy of it. At some point during the interaction, another agent came out from the back and took over my check-in. I asked why my ID was being photocopied and was rather flatly told that it's hotel policy for last minute bookings. I don't know why a second agent was needed, but I got the sense they found me rather suspicious. 

I certainly do not have a problem with the hotel managing risk for what probably is ultimately a higher-risk transaction for them. But the way it was handled was poor. They could have explained to me why this is a policy and how they take steps to protect my information, when they will destroy the copy of my passport, etc. 

Between the engagement of a second staff member and the ID issue, the whole interaction left me feeling like a criminal when I was simply trying to find a place to sleep that night.",4,2024,05,28
226,Best hotel breakfast,"Belfast is a beautiful city, the hotel is so close to the city centre and serving the best breakfast we have ever had. Spectacular buffet and laudable variety of hot food. Service was excellent, our host, Judy was engaging and all the staff well trained. Highly recommend to start breakfast with a glass of mimosa or two.",5,2024,05,27
226,Afternoon Tea,Had afternoon tea for a birthday party at The Fitzwilliam. I cannot recommend this place highly enough.  The staff are more than helpful and so friendly. As for The Afternoon Tea. It was great value for money and could not even finish it!!!!!!,5,2024,05,25
226,Best in Belfast,"Overall a good visit. We were greeted right away as we arrived they were very attentive and was able to check into my room early. My requests were met and in my room upon checkin. The genuinely cared about me and my spouse. The room was nice and the bed was comfortable. The shower was awesome.
The room was a little tight and didn‚Äôt accommodate lots of suit cases. The views were nothing special however location is good.  Room was smaller than I thought for a large king suite but service was impeccable.  Choose room 817. Overall great hotel and location.",5,2024,05,24
226,Brilliant meal with great chefs and waiters,Fabulous meal and dinner experience. Well looked after by Ahmed and Bikesh. Thanks lads. Lovely setting and wonderfully quiet dining experience.

226,Great location,"A place that you will want to return to. Centrally located and felt safe walking to pubs, shops, and St George Street market.",5,2024,05,23
226,Truly a beautiful hotel,"This hote's decoration alone is superb.  The room was a very nice combination of sitting area and a bedroom.  The beds are very comfortable and every amenity is there for you. The only downside at this hotel is that occupancy of the room is clearly stated to be 3PM. Unfortunately, transatlantic travelers will spend a great deal of time in the lobby prior to gaining access to the their rooms. Not an uncommon situation but one that I wish gave access to rooms on a first come first served basis. ",5,2024,05,21
226,All the touches of a modern hotel with old school hospitality,"Our stay at the Fitzwilliam was fantastic! From the moment we entered and concierge took our bags and greeted us, we knew we were going to be well looked after. Everyone from concierge to the ladies who were running breakfast, to the turn down team were very pleasant and helpful. Nothing was too much trouble. A lady at breakfast couldn‚Äôt get us more hot water quick enough and offered to pour the tea for us and get us fresh cups. This is indicative of the level of service you can expect from the Fitzwilliam. The location was great and our rooms were fully stocked with everything you could possibly need. The carpets were very sumptuous and we all had a great night‚Äôs sleep. Highly recommend! ",5,2024,05,20
226,Truely the friendliest hotel in the centre of Belfast,"This was our first stay in Belfast and was unsure which hotel to choose because as you would expect in a large city such as Belfast there is a large array of choice.  We booked the Fitzwilliam Hotel and were not disappointed.  There are a number of room options listed on the website and it was helpful to be able to discuss the various merits of each one on the telephone with Shannon (Who was very helpful and patient) before deciding on the room type and making the booking.  We had opted for the valet car parking and was first met on arrival by Gavin who was wonderful.  We would also like to thank Pete for looking after our luggage on check-out day.  We went to check-in and was greeted by Yasmine who was absolutely lovely, friendly and helpful which continued throughout our stay.  We had breakfast and dinner on each day of our stay with dinner  in the bar.  The food was delicious with an array of options and was again well looked after by the host and each of the waiters.  The suite we stayed in was amazing and had everything you could need. Have to say that it was a struggle to leave.  Overall, the Fitzwilliam Hotel is a fantastic hotel in a convenient location with a great team and would like to take this opportunity to thank everyone (In particular Yasmine) for making our stay a memorable one.",5,2024,05,19
226,Not quite luxury,"The room looked nice however there were a few things that let it down.
Issues with the lights meant that I got woken as they came on fully at 2am.
USB sockets did not work for charging.
TV stand looked like a trolley and the TV did not look stable. I wouldnt have been comfortable with a young child in the room.
Mini fridge was cheap and fell apart on touch.
Shower mat was filthy.
Breakfast was not very tasty. Omelette overcooked and fruit was mushy.
Pastries and coffee were very nice.
Bed was comfy.
Lots of noise from the road underneath the window.
No view, just the office block opposite.",3,2024,05,19
226,Brilliant options and even better service!,Decided to take my wife out for drinks at the hotel bar. We were impressed with the cocktails available. The Barman Ruairi was extremely helpful and fun in helping us. An advocate for his workplace and one the hotel should be proud of! Will definitely be back soon!,5,2024,05,18

226,Excellent. Very welcoming hotel,"Excellent . Love the location being city centre. Perfect for short break. Would love to visit more but rather expensive for overnight stay. Well worth saving for the treat now & again.

226,Fab Bank Holiday Weekend,"Excellent service from start to finish. Nothing was too much trouble.
Concierge were fabulous organising some energy drinks to be sent up to the room and collection of a wheelchair prior to our arrival.

Breakfast was lovely and fresh (Belfast Fry at its best) and evening meal (poussin curry) was divine. Also loved Passion Fruit Martini ;)

Thank you for a wonderful stay! We will be back",5,2024,05,15
226,Do not recommend,"I‚Äôd like to be a fair reviewer, so I‚Äôll give you 
THE GOOD; excellent location although a bit tricky to find the set down reception area on first go around, very attentive bellhop & valet, the room was spacious and the sofa was even comfortable. 
THE BAD: the Fitzwilliam is an old hotel with awful air-conditioning. Temp outside was colder than room but only 1 small window opened a crack, our room remained 80F all night. We called and asked hotel to fix the A/C because the temperature did NOT down in 6+ hours. We put it on lowest setting available at highest fan before leaving. It cooled 2 degrees in over 2 hours.  At bedtime, it was 26C.  Reception sent up a guy who just turned the unit on/off just like we did and turned up the fan just like we did and lowered the temp just like we did. He said to call in one hour if it hadn't improved.  No offer was made of moving us to another room.  By 1 am, I wanted to be asleep and not waiting around for non-existant A/C. When we told receptionist about our poor night sleep and that we were sweating trying to fall asleep his response: ""I'll leave a detailed note for the day shift because nothing can be done at night. The Mini bar was pathetic my 2 bottles of water and their special popcorn.  There were a couple small alcoholic bottles but the main issue was even if you bought your own drinks, the fridge NEVER COOLED down either.   Lastly our sink didn‚Äôt drain either.   All of these issues should NEVER be present at a 5 star hotel.   I can only surmise that no one ever checks on these 5 star hotels besides guests.    

Sadly we made multiple complaints over our 3 night stay and these issues were never addressed, no call from a manager, nothing!!!!  We paid 5 star prices and the only concession was they comped up breakfast on one day?!!  
I would not recommend at all.",4,2024,05,14
226,Made my trip to Belfast so special,"My boyfriend booked this hotel for my first time visiting the city. I was blown away with how polite, friendly and amazing the staff were. The room was so beautiful and comfortable, with a spacious shower and bathtub with a little tea light as a special touch. The location was perfect. Zero hiccups with the valet parking. We dined in the hotel and the food was gorgeous- we both had the sea bass with the risotto. The cocktails were marvellous, the best I‚Äôd had on the trip. We had come home to relax one evening and ended up spending an extra hour or two in the bar, enjoying the live music. I felt like a princess using the room service option for Sunday breakfast, which was prompt and delicious. I could go on and on. Special thank you to Shannon for the quick response when I realised I‚Äôd stupidly forgotten an important document in a drawer after I‚Äôd left- this was dealt with swiftly and my mind put at ease. I could really go on! But I really had the most wonderful time. This hotel and all the staff should be really proud of themselves.",5,2024,05,13
226,Horrible A/C with Motel 6 level service,"Ugh .. the Fitzwilliam is an old hotel with awful air-conditioning. Temp outside was 61F but our room remained 80F all night. Call and ask hotel to start up the A/C before you arrive because it will NOT down in 6+ hours. We put it on 12.5C (lowest) at highest fan before leaving for dinner. It was 26.5C when we left and 25.5 when we returned 2hrs later. At bedtime, it was 25C.  Reception sent up a guy who turned the unit on/off just like we did, turned up the fan just like we did and lowered the temp just like we did.  He said to call in one hour if it hadn't improved. By 1230a, I wanted to be asleep and not monkeying around with A/C.  When we told receptionist about our poor night sleep, his response: ""I'll tell you what I'm going to do. I will notify maintenance to fix the problem."" We're checking out. You could stick it up your a** for all we care, buddy! 

3 stars for the free wine and candle in the bathtub.

Avoid.",3,2024,05,10
226,Highly recommended! Would stay again!,"Everything was fantastic; location, staff, rooms, the designer chocolates they leave as part of turn-down service, the breakfast.

Amazing view from our deluxe junior suite. Breakfast was outstanding, lots of choice from hot or cold food and plenty of drinks to choose from, all staff at breakfast were very helpful and polite. Overall experience was definitely 10/10, not a single thing to complain about. Every staff member couldn‚Äôt do enough for you, nothing was too much trouble.

226,"Fantastic stay, excellent staff and lovely location","A lovely stay at the Fitz.  The staff are excellent, from an immediate warm greeting before you step into the hotel through every interaction that we had.

The service was wonderful. Everyone was very attentive and friendly. 
The food was excellent. I cannot recommend it enough.

Bathroom lovely, room was well equipped. cocktails in bar were fab. Breakfast was very good with a great choice.",4,2024,04,22
226,Great stay,The front desk was wonderful.   Yasmin did a wonderful job getting two weary travelers settled after a hard day of traveling.   The hotel is walkable to most things in the city.  Clean and well maintained.   The rooms are quite large for a city hotel.,5,2024,04,22
226,5 star hotel with 6 star service,"We travelled around Ireland and our first visit in Belfast, but sure not the last. Very welcoming city and hotel.
Best part of our stay was the excellent, delicious breakfast. Warm welcome, professional explanation from the manager, Judith.
All staff were extremly polite and gave us some program tips, was a nice touch. But all staff we met just couldn't be more friendly and helpful.
The hotel ambience is so relaxing, the fire place with sofa at the lobby area looks cosy, did not get a chance have a nightcap there, but definitely will try next time.",5,2024,04,20
226,Family pre theatre meal,Ahmed provided great service at the pre theatre meal for my family! We enjoyed our meal thoroughly and it was great value for money! It is also a very handy location both to the city centre and the opera house. We will definitely be back! Thanks,5,2024,04,18

226,An outstanding stay in a wonderful hotel.,"An outstanding stay from start to finish. We arrived for a birthday weekend, and were kindly upgraded to a very nice suit. Our dinner that evening was in the Restaurant and the service was amazing. The whole team just kept delivering. 

Thankyou so much for the memories.",5,2024,04,14
226,Fab family stay,"We stayed here during a city break to Belfast. The hotel is centrally located, so it‚Äôs easy to use it as a base to get around. We arrived early and dropped our bags off, and were delighted to get a phone call saying our rooms were ready early while we were out and about. 

Our rooms were lovely - spacious, very comfortable beds and beautifully scented toiletries (remarked upon by the teenager in our group)! There was a turndown service each evening, with nice chocolates left as a gift, and some nice complimentary snacks and drinks in our minibar. 

We had breakfast included in our package, and it was excellent. A really comprehensive continental selection, all of which looked fresh and appetising, and an extensive list of cooked options which left us struggling to choose between. We used room service on evening - a good choice of reasonably priced options, delivered swiftly and enjoyed by all of us. 

There‚Äôs a well stocked bar that we visited for cocktails and snacks post day out, they were also lovely. 

The best thing though, was the staff. Everyone was simply brilliant - warm, friendly and welcoming. Everyone seemed genuinely interested in making sure we got the best from our stay in the city. We loved it and will definitely be back - thank you!",5,2024,04,14
226,"Overall , a nice stay.","Charged by hotel for room already payed via booking.com , was rectified but was perplexed at stating I had already been charged 2 days before. 

Overall , a nice overnight stay .
Food was excellent and waitress was fablous (Vilma) . 

Service was excellent in bar/resturant",4,2024,04,14
226,Poor,"Room not worth the money and some of the staff were very rash also some nice people there paid online and charged again got a refund 

Got a bar tab told them we were going for food we will be back chased us down like criminals wanting the money and on the way out tried to charge us again for the dinner 

It‚Äôs wild we had to keep receipts with us everywhere we went 

Definitely a luxurious hotel but not worth the money they forget Belfast is a working man‚Äôs city 

Was there for my 40th but would not go again.",1,2024,04,14
226,Fitz Friday Cocktail,"Our first time at the Fitzwilliam and not the last! What an amazing night! We started off by being greeted by Lauren who was helpful and told us about the wonderful 2 for 1 cocktail. Tricia (I remembered your name!) served us our multiple drinks and was hilarious. She joked and chatted away with us and other tables nearby. There was a tall gentleman who made our drinks and was great at making them. Sorry, I forgot his name. 
My husband and I can‚Äôt wait for another Friday night. But this was a great place to go before the theatre. 
10 out of 10",5,2024,04,13
226,Wonderful staff make this hotel fantastic.,"It starts with service, Gerard, Manager of Concierge treated us with such kindness and helped arrange private transport for us to get to Galway as these two Canadians were too knackered to take multiple trains.  Also deserving of mention is Pete, sweet Pete whom we had to call to our room not once but twice to help us with both the tv and the AC. Bless his heart, such patience, kindness and understanding. Both these men were true gentlemen through and through. Hiring people like them are what makes a good hotel, great. The hotel itself is lovely, beautifully decorated and perfectly situated.",5,2024,04,12
226,Perfect Stay in the Perfect Location,"Cannot recommend enough! Absolutely perfect stay. The room was spacious, with excellent amenities (everything from ear plugs to playing cards are in the room and complimentary, fridge in the room stocked with cold water, and the turn down service included Lily O‚ÄôBrien chocolates on the pillows which was lovely). The bathroom was also stunning, with a waterfall shower, really nice toiletries, and had candles and essential oils around the bath for you to use. Also, I have to say probably one of the comfiest hotel beds I‚Äôve ever slept on (I hate hard mattresses and so many hotels have super hard mattresses). Staff went above and beyond, always with a smile and a hello. Super helpful, absolutely nothing they couldn‚Äôt do for you. 

The location is amazing, just round the corner from the bus station (super convenient as we were getting the bus back to Belfast International Airport, and if you‚Äôre wanting to get the bus to other areas). Also very walkable to a plethora of activities, stores (clothing and groceries), restaurants, pubs and bars. 

My friends and I are already talking about coming back to Belfast at some point, and we‚Äôll definitely be staying here again if we do.",5,2024,04,12
226,Expecting More,"We stayed at the Fitzwilliam for two nights as a family of 6 (this required 3 rooms).  Each of the rooms was ""fine"" but defintely had some spots that were a bit outdated and/or rough around the edges.   The carpet in two of the rooms was in particularly rough shape.  The beds were comfortable and the rooms had your standard convenience items.  We ate at the hotel restaurant one evening and the meal was good but nothing out of the ordinary.  The kids did particularly enjoy the mocktail list.  The location of the hotel is very good and in nice proximity to various attractions throughout Belfast.  While the stay was fine, I'd been expecting more.  We'd probably try something else next time we're in Belfast.",3,2024,04,11
226,Amazing stay,"Oisin the bar man was really a delight to deal with his service alone was top class. The whole night we did not worry about waiting for a drink , every time our glasses neared the end he was over straight away to take another order. I‚Äôd highly recommend the hotel just for the outstanding service of the bar men.",5,2024,04,11
226,Family time,"The whole team were wonderful. We came for a family weekend & the whole thing was great. 
A big thank you to American woman who made our kids feel welcome. Yasmine at reception who helped us make plan with our big group. 
There was so many others, but i can't remember their names 
But thank you everyone.",5,2024,04,11

226,A night to remember in the Fitzwilliam,"Greeted by the very welcoming reception staff before being shown to our beautiful room by the lovely concierge. It was my partners birthday and much to our delight, the staff had very thoughtful provided a happy birthday slate with maroons and cake, along with complimentary wine and popcorn (it's the little touches that add to the experience!). After getting ready, to go down for dinner, we bumped into the hotel sales and marketing director, the lovely Janine, who could not have been more welcoming or down to earth. She was very helpful recommending local venues and giving overall advice. She took the time to have a chat and made us feel at home. The room was spacious and luxurious. The following morning, the wide variety of continental and cooked breakfast did not disappoint. I would highly recommend the Fitzwilliam, for anyone wanting an extra special get away.",5,2024,04,08
226,Exceptional Value in the heart of the city,"First visit to the Fitzwilliam Hotel it was a very pleasant experience, staff were attentive. Special mention goes to Terry who was a great host who walked us through the afternoon tea menu and ensured our glasses were full. Nice birthday  surprise for my daughter",4,2024,04,08
226,Afternoon Ten outta Ten,My gal pals and I have been to many Afternoon Teas around NI but nothing like this!! WOW!! From the welcoming at the door by concierge to the ambience of the room and the freshness and selection of the sandwiches & pastries OMG!!Very special mention to Terry he is absolutely fantastic and a credit to the hotel. True gentleman.,5,2024,04,08

226,The best hotel in Belfast,"Thank you for having us at your hotel. We felt welcomed.
The staff was always friendly, supportive, attentive and did everything to keep us distracted from our worst flight experience with KLM.
I have never been at a better place.

We noticed some small damages from the previous visitors of our room. Those were fixed within the day.

Everything you need to see in Belfast is within european walking distance. A lot of bus lines are available directly next to the hotel.

I can absolutely recommend this hotel - without any hesitation.",5,2024,04,06
226,Fabulous hotel in Belfast,"Absolutely fantastic location in Belfast. Fabulous service, beautifully appointed rooms and the staff are first class. The concierges have extensive local knowledge of Belfast but also surrounding areas and are more than willing to impart this knowledge to guests. Highly recommend this hotel.",5,2024,04,04
226,Fantastic Staff,Yasmine on the front desk and Brian in the bar were totally fantastic. Both deserve praise for being outstanding ambassadors for this great hotel. We won't stay anywhere else in Belfast and can't wait to get back again. Highly recommended!,5,2024,04,02
226,No early check in ( Preferred member) wet carpet no housekeeping service huge television blocking everything on bureau,The Fitzwilliam  hotel was the only place I would stay in Belfast I have stayed there since the first week it opened. My last stay was not good. I arrived on Christmas Eve as a preferred member I was entiled to an early check in this did not happen and usually I am greeted with a welcome back the receptionist asked me I had ever stayed at the Fitzwilliam  before and  told me my room  was not ready so I had to come back later which I did . When i got to my room the carpet was wet and they had recently added a huge flat screen TV which took up most of the bureau and I was unable to access any electrical units in that area . Christmas morning I left the sign on the door to have my room made up when I returned that evening it was never cleaned it was late so i just had them send up clean towels.  Upon checking out on December 26th I mentioned that I was not happy with my stay the gentleman walked away and didnt answer me. I wrote and Emailed the manage about my experience he never responded so next time  I arrive in Belfast I will stay elsewhere.,2,2024,04,01
226,Excellent hotel with exceptional staff,"We visited The Fitzwilliam Horel over Easter weekend to celebrate my husband‚Äôs birthday. I chose this hotel based on previous reviews, and I was not disappointed. The hotel itself is lovely, the room was great and the location perfect for exploring the city centre. The bar and restaurant were also fabulous. But what made our experience was the staff. Truly exceptional customer service. Every single member of the team was friendly, helpful and professional. We couldn‚Äôt fault them. A great example of how it should be. Thank you to you all for a truly fantastic weekend! ",5,2024,04,01
226,Lovely afternoon tea,"Great, enjoyable, delicious afternoon tea. The team was so nice and welcoming. Great ambiance, better value for money than other afternoon tea places we have been to.

The staff are just amazing and the hotel is superb",5,2024,03,30
226,Very comfortable and relaxed,This Hotel certainly lived up to its 5 stars. From the welcome to our departure it exceded our expectations. The evening meals were so much to our liking that we ate there the 3 night we were in Belfast.,5,2024,03,29
226,Lovely Belfast Hotel,Centrally located. Nicely decorated.  Very clean.  Good sized rooms. Friendly professional staff. Great breakfast. Lovely bar food. Staff went to the trouble of making changes to an item on the menu to suit my tastes. ,5,2024,03,27
226,Awesome hotel with amazing staff,"We ended our trip in Belfast, and it was so nice to stay at this hotel. From the time we walked in, staff was there to help with our stay and our trip. The hotel lobby is beautiful with a nice warm fireplace, a whole bunch of comfortable seats and sofas, and tons of books on the shelf. I spent every morning reading a book on local history. Our room was very nice, clean and spacious. The bed was very comfortable and the bathroom was large and clean. The shower was amazing, best of our trip. There is some peeling of plaster on the roof and some damaged caulk, hopefully they will address this in the future. 
Staff were awesome. Pete and Gavin in concierge were awesome. Two thumbs up to them. They helped us with all of our tours, and our driver for day trips and airport connections. Pete was super helpful, telling us where to go for dinner and drinks. We really enjoyed chatting with him. 
Front desk staff were awesome as well. The check-in was fast and easy. 
The bar downstairs was nice and hip. We had a few drinks there. The breakfast was very good as well in the dining room, probably the best wheat toast I‚Äôve ever had. 
The hotel is well-situated in downtown, pretty close to all the sights, either walk or take a taxi. We really loved Belfast. Great history and a beautiful city.",5,2024,03,26
226,My best hotel experience for many years.,"Excellent hotel, with wonderful staff and beautiful rooms. The hotel is located in the centre of Belfast and within easy walking distance of all attractions including pubs/restaurants etc. From arrival the staff were professional and courteous throughout our stay and couldn't have been more helpful. We were on a bed & breakfast basis and the menu choice was extensive.",5,2024,03,26
226,Lovely Stay,"Lovely hotel, excellent location.

226,2 sausage 2 bacon,"Caught between 4 or a 5 rating, this hotel is in a super location with a very short walk to the centre. We got an upgraded room which was really impressive with lots of space,various ‚Äòfreebie‚Äôs‚Äô and a bath.
As a previous reviewer mentioned be careful of  the edge of the bed as I too caught my toe,very painful. My only other minor criticism was the full Irish breakfast which only came with 1 sausage and 1 rasher of bacon as std. Didn‚Äôt get done on this the second morning as I asked the waitress for 2 of each. Finally all the staff were really pleasant and helpful.",4,2024,03,24
226,Disappointing,"Was an ok hotel,  but certainly  not 5*.  I‚Äôve stayed in nicer 4* hotels before. Positives were: lovely reception staff @ check in, easy to reach room, nice colour scheme  in room, ease of checking in/out.   But outweighed by Negatives unfortunately: Firstly, bad booking experience - booked direct with hotel after cancelling with Booking.com but inexplicably received 3 ‚Äòsorry you‚Äôve cancelled‚Äô emails directly from hotel (not from Booking.com) thereafter.  Several phone calls later, with different staff groups  (again, reception staff very pleasant, but ‚Äòreservation‚Äô staff less so, one female being quite impatient and bit rude)  I remained nervous  about security of booking until we had checked in.  In fairness we received a ‚Äòfree upgrade‚Äô to a Superior Room as an apology.
But room, sadly,  wasn‚Äôt great either: too warm, VERY noisy, low hanging pendant lights right at bedside (we both hit our heads on then, more than once  üòÇ); no plug sockets at one bedside, few sockets in room at all  (until several found blocked by table under TV) very bright LED alarm clock at bedside, uncertainty  if minibar water was complimentary; badly scratched bathroom sink, no decaf tea & only 2 sugars/no sweeteners with coffee making stuff.  Many small details, but soon added up.  Breakfast was nice but felt odd to order from main menu BEFORE having continental buffet part?!.  So we asked to order  AFTER continental, which seemed to confuse breakfast staff & three  different waiters/waitresses came to our table to check.  My french toast was lovely, but my sister‚Äôs Eggs Benedict portion VERY small (given not insubstantial room rate!).  Otherwise  breakfast was very nice.  But all things considered, will try a different Belfast hotel next time, 5* or otherwise.",3,2024,03,22
226,Fitzwilliam Belfast never Five Star,"Well no way is this hotel 5 stars unbelievable.. 
Lifts a disgrace, hotel is tiny, room good size.. but here it comes..

Beds have a wooden box round the base, makes walking round bed dangerous, access to bed difficult without hitting part of your body off wood.. room size is good.. views dreadful.. 

Food.. didn‚Äôt try anything.. was not impressed how staff addressed you.. forced to sit outside restaurant in seating area for sandwich and tea ..",1,2024,03,20
226,Beautiful experience!,"A very cozy hotel with friendly and professional staff, really interested in providing a great experience to every guest. We even had complementary cocktails for my birthday celebration. Much appreciated! Looking forward to go back.",5,2024,03,20
226,Belfast visit,"Fabulous hotel in a good location.

226,Luxury 5 star city centre with all of the small details!,"Perfect night away for a couple! A warm and friendly check in with lots of information about the hotel provided. The concierge brought our bags to the room while we were out shopping which was a nice touch. The hotel is in such a great location for all activities. The room was very clean and had lots of small touches to give it that 5 star feel. Myself and my partner went to the restaurant on the first floor where we were greeted with a smile by the hostess. We opted to go for the Chateaubriand which was cooked to perfection (medium-rare) as it was a special occasion. The staff couldn't have been any more accommodating even giving my partner a birthday plate which just added to the overall experience. We had the cheesecake and the hazelnut brownie which were heavenly. We had a night cap in the bar which has a quirky vibe. Drinks were served with a complimentary nibbles tray of olives, popcorn & crisps which we devoured. The live music created a good atmosphere we ended up staying for longer than expected. The cocktails were amazing and we ended up ordering more to take to our room. We really enjoyed the hotel and will definitely be back.",5,2024,03,11
226,Mothers day afternoon tea,"Beautiful afternoon spent at the fitzwilliam hotel for Mothering Sunday for their special Pink themed afternoon tea . We really were made to feel special , all the small touches were brilliant . Handwritten place cards with our family name , little flower bouquets on each napkin , and the presentation on the afternoon tea stands was better than we have had anywhere (including a similar themed experience in London ) . Service from every single member of staff was again unlike anywhere we have been before - a genuine keenness to enhance your experience . 10/10 Fitzwilliam- I‚Äôll be back !",5,2024,03,11
226,Beautiful hotel,"On our recent trip to Belfast we stayed here and wow from check in to check out , it was the perfect hotel experience, the staff were so friendly and  helpful , the hotel was beautiful and the location was perfect, I would definitely stay here again ",5,2024,03,06
226,Not the best,"For the price I would have expected better overall. We found pins in the carpet, the TV system is really poor quality and not a lot of channel selections. They gifted us 2 cocktails in exchange for the pins in the carpet, when that‚Äôs a fairly serious overlook by the staff.  ",3,2024,03,06
226,Luxury hotel with incredible staff,"Hotel is very nice, with staff going above and beyond, and nice large rooms. Location is good and easy to get around the city. Great bar and comfy lobby to hang out in. I would stay here again without question. Highly recommend. ",5,2024,03,05
226,Great location rooms need tlc,We have been to the Fitzwilliam a few times but on this occasion we found the room a bit shabby and not to the usual standards that we would expect from the Fitzwilliam. The restaurant and cocktails were fantastic and the hotels location is perfect.,4,2024,03,03
226,Perfection,"A stunning hotel that has everything you need and will do everything to ensure your comfort/satisfaction. You are looked after from the moment you enter. Rooms are modern, comfortable and have great views over the city. We stayed in a Junior Suite and it was simply stunning. The valet service was superb on arrival/departure. We will definitely be back!",5,2024,03,03
226,Overnight Stay Executive Double for Theatre visit,"The bed was comfortable, the bathroom spacious and plenty of towels, robes and slippers. No usb charging points so take an adapter as well as your cable. I personally found the room very dark and gloomy but we were only staying overnight anyway.  The staff were friendly and helpful and the food in the bar was very tasty, even the nibbles with late night drinks were decent quality.  The lobby seating area was pretty cold so take something warm.  We went for a performances at the Grand Opera House and it couldn‚Äôt have been more convenient, really just steps away, you could mak a dash for it if you didn‚Äôt want to take your coat.
I am a light sleeper so I didn‚Äôt sleep so well with the sound of road sweepers/bin lorries on the main road in the early hours but once the work traffic started it was actually surprisingly quieter.  There was less noise than I expected from revellers given it‚Äôs on a main night life road and little from ambulances so close to the Royal hospital.  It is in the city so I did expect noise.  ",4,2024,03,02
226,"Family room is not kid friendly, Terrible.","Terrible experience.  We stayed 3 nights in a family room.  This room was not suitable for children.  The room is very small with no room to walk.  The kids bed was an uncomfortable pull out sofa with hard and sharp metal edges.  My kids were cut up and bruised hourly from this bed and things in the room.  Every table top has glass on top of it.  There was so much stuff in the room (espresso machine, hot water maker, plates, 6 glass cups, spoons, etc) that there is no room to put any of your own stuff.  There is no counter or shelf space in the bathroom other than a very tiny glass shelf over the sink.  The sink is high and cannot be reached by children, we had to move the one chair in the room into the bathroom so our kids could wash their hands.  There are only 2 outlets in the entire room to charge phones (not near the bed)!  Whoever designated this as a family room does not have children.  This room is dangerous for kids.

We attempted to go to the restaurant at 530pm and were turned away being told they were fully booked for the night.  We tried to eat at the bar and also told there was no space.  Mind you this was in February! Room service is 10 pounds for delivery and then you run into the problem of having no space in your room to eat due to all the unneeded junk they put in your room.  We sat on the floor behind the bed to eat.  Terrible.

We booked the hotel on their own website after making a Preferred Hotels account.  We tried to change our stay from 3 nights to 2 and were told that because we used the Preferred Hotels Promo Code we would be changed an extra 100 pounds if we stayed one night less.

 Concierge was very nice and helpful.

This place is a joke, stay away.",2,2024,03,02
226,Very disappointing stay at Fitzwilliam 5 star hotel. I wouldn't stay again . Staff not friendly,Daughter had bought package for myself at Christmas.When we arrived in room wasn't wowed mini bar had water and bedend all scratched up. We went to reception and said abt minibar they said they put some complementary items in 2 small wine and popcorn. Went for 2 course meal which was enjoyed small portions ordered dessert and we had still water was told dessert ¬£10 each went to pay it was ¬£26.50 was charged ¬£6.50 for a bottle of water. Found all staff unwelcoming any request seemed a bother. TV meant to have all these channels we had 10. We didn't sleep at all room stuffy. Went for breakfast daughter ordered full fry was asked did she want beans came without beans I ordered eggs benedict small portion was asked would I like sausage or bacon on side I said bacon please came without had yo ask for bacon. I really don't think are room 5 star or our stay 5 stars,2,2024,03,02
226,Perfect getaway in Belfast,"We have absolutely loved our stay! The wonderful staff helped us arrange some fabulous dinners and tours.

Location is good, 2 mins walk from the airport bus final drop off.  Nio need for bus passes to gte around its all within easy walking diastance.",5,2024,02,21
226,Don't expect to sleep.,Noisy rooms and poor quality sheets and duvets. There was a poorly repaired sink. The road noise was terrible from the road away from the hotel.  Lots of machine noise and vibration in the hotel.  If you're a light sleeper I just wouldn't go.,2,2024,02,21

226,Don‚Äôt go if you‚Äôre a light sleeper,Terrible night‚Äôs sleep. Very noisy hotel. The room was beginning to look very tired. The sink had been damaged and repaired in a really poor way when it should have been replaced. The bedding was of poor quality and the duvet all man made fibre,2,2024,02,20
226,Great weekend break,"Super hotel with a fabulous location so close to everything. The staff are all very friendly, efficient and welcoming. 
The room spotless and soft furnishings of a high quality.
We ate in the hotel restaurant on one night and weren‚Äôt disappointed. 
If there was one critique to share it would be the breakfast buffet. It only had a small selection of fresh fruit. I think fresh berries would have been better than the ones on offer. Having said that the freshly prepared hot food was fantastic. 
All in all a great stay and I would recommend this hotel.",5,2024,02,19
226,Happy,"Exactly what i needed, Pleasant very helpful close to the town,rooms was very clean and tidy. reception staff very nice with lovely smiles on there faces Very welcoming at all times,breakfast was outstanding had everything you could need ",5,2024,02,18

226,Good service but hotel decoration/furnishings are in need of an update,"friendly staff (one exception see below), excellent breakfast. Room cleaning was military style, despite do not disturb style the statement upon staff was at around 1000am, cleaning is now or never. Hotel deco and furnishings are in need of refurb (or treat as 4*), case in point the complete cracked surface areas of bathroom sink.",3,2024,02,17
226,Nearly perfect,"We stayed here for a night in January and generally found the hotel to be excellent. The check in was efficient and friendly but on going to our room we found the corridor to be very dark which led to a difficulty on entering the room as we could not find where to put the key card to activate the lights and ended up having to use an i-phone to find it. The room itself was good with very comfortable pillows and bed and plenty of amenities. That night we had a meal in the restaurant which was excellent with friendly staff followed by a few drinks in the bar where the service was again very good. Breakfast had an excellent cold buffet but what really stood out was a proper menu of hot choices which were superb and unusual in hotels which normally just have a hot buffet, One aspect we noted was that when guests went outside for a cigarette they had no place to put their butts meaning that they were strewn around the doors and this led to an untidy area. All in all an excellent stage except for the corridor lighting and the outside area.",4,2024,02,17
226,Best hotel in Belfast,Beautiful hotel with fantastic staff.  Lovely rooms and service the breakfast is really amazing such a selection to choose from best I've had.  Perfect location right in the city centre walking distance to everywhere.,5,2024,02,16
226,Ok,"First impressions were good we were greeted by the concierge who took our bags into reception and on to our room, the car was also parked for us. Smooth check-in. Room was ok not sure of the 5 star rating, large chip in the bathroom handbasin. The lighting in the room was poor, as it was in the corridors to the rooms. It was ok but stayed in better 4 stars..",3,2024,02,15
226,Really lovely hotel,"Really lovely hotel, very clean, wonderful service in a great location. Room was really a nice size and very clean. The staff are so helpful and friendly. Location is great for theatre and everything in Belfast. ",5,2024,02,15
226,Romantic personal service excellent staff & food,"We went for a meal on valentines night. From the moment we entered the hotel we were welcomed professionally and friendly. We were shown to a lovely private table. As it being valentines night the setting was perfect as the restaurant layout is perfect. All the restaurants staff were very friendly and welcoming, Amy. and James looked after us all evening, nothing was too much trouble very attentive. Food was 5 star, presented professionally and cooked to perfection. Extra little touches were breads for starters choice of still or sparkling water, recommend the fillet and sirloin steaks with the jumbo garlic prawns. Will definitely be back to the Fitzwilliam and will be booking an over night stay.",5,2024,02,15
226,Great short stay,"We live in Belfast but as a treat my daughter booked afternoon tea and an over night stay at the Fitzwilliam as we were going to see David Suchet (amazing)  at the Grand Opera house (right next door to the hotel). The hotel is beautiful. The rooms were spacious and very comfortable. Staff were all friendly, welcoming and helpful. They really seemed to enjoy their work and made our short stay a delight. Afternoon tea was just fantastic! The food was delicious and plentiful, lots of choice on the savoury and sweet courses.  With the afternoon tea we were offered a glass of Prosecco as we don‚Äôt drink alcohol we were offered 3 non alcoholic alternatives( lovely touch). My daughter had her pick of lots of different teas. She  opted for Wild Berry which she said was lovely. I‚Äôm a coffee drinker so I had a couple of Americanos. The staff were very attentive and  chatty and we enjoyed the experience very much. After the theatre we had a good night‚Äôs sleep. Next morning we had an amazing breakfast anything you can think of is available. The fresh orange juice was the best.  We‚Äôve stayed at many wonderful hotels and the Fitzwilliam would definitely would be one of my favourites .",5,2024,02,13
226,Superb stay,"Had the most amazing two nights here. Staff are incredibly kind and friendly,  rooms are stunning,  spotlessly clean and luxurious. Free mini bar too. Absolutely amazing  breakfast lunch and dinner in the bar excellent. A fantastic stay can't wait to return, superb value for money. ",5,2024,02,12
226,"Perfectly located, luxury hotel",The Fitzwilliam Hotel did not disappoint. It is in a great location. Excellent staff. Nicely designed and decorated. Spacious room with added luxury touches. We would certainly stay here again when in Belfast.,5,2024,02,12
226,Mother daughter trip,Took my child off 8 for a wee night away she loved it ... she felt like a princess .. food amazing.. staff were out off this world .. thanks so so much .. loved every minute .. very clean and very luxurious ,5,2024,02,10
226,Purse and wallet stolen from room,"My partner and I stayed here for two nights. Both our wallets were stolen from our sixth floor room while we were out and during the time housekeeping took place. A credit card purchase was made and several others attempted after we cancelled all our cards.

Electronic door key history confirmed no other keys had been used. According to the property information there is ""24-hour security"" but there is nothing stopping anyone entering the hotel, freely using the lift without a key card and walking around the corridors. Lucky them if a room door is left wide open while housekeeping is in the bathroom with music playing  (as we saw first hand) or away to fetch items from a store cupboard. This might be what happened...the alternative possibilities are even more concerning. 

We felt we had to keep approaching and asking for updates rather than being kept informed. Waited 24 hours for CCTV to be reviewed which wasn't positioned in a advantageous place so showed nothing. We mostly dealt with Matthew who did seem to genuinely care and tried his best but was clearly not used to such a situation.

At no point were we asked if we needed financial aid and instead had to phone a friend for help. We were in a state of shock and just accepted a lift to the airport so we could get home. We should have been demanding a full refund - though that should  really have been one of the first things proposed by the hotel!",1,2024,02,10
226,Great Hotel,Location perfect. Staff friendly and helpful Guestrooms have the most comfy beds and nice little treats left for visitors. Great selection for breakfast both continental and a large selection to choose from the cooked menu. Fresh flowers around the hotel A great place to stay,5,2024,02,09
226,My favorite hotel,"Clean, comfortable, cute rooms with everything you need. The best of the best in staff, food, facilities, and location. I've stayed now twice and everything great is consistently great. I look forward to my next visit. ",5,2024,02,07

226,"The best we've stayed in, in Belfast","I reviewed the Fitzwilliam after we stayed for the first time in July 2022.  A year and a half later, we have stayed more than a dozen times, which speaks volumes.  Friendly staff and atmosphere, the rooms are spacious and fitted out to a high standard.  If ever anything is not as it should be , which is bound to happen from time to time, it is sorted out. So many small touches which add to up to a great experience and, to be welcomed back with a personal note and some sweet treats, is much appreciated.  ",5,2024,02,06
226,Great Stay,"We enjoyed our stay at Fitzwilliam. Staff are brilliant and the Breakfast and Dinner were fabulous. A beautiful hotel, our only complaint was an industrial noise throughout the night which meant we didn't get any sleep.",4,2024,02,05
226,Memorable Time in Belfast,Excellent Hotel right in the heart of the City Centre. All of the staff were excellent and responsive to any requirements.

226,Excellent as always!,"It's been a while since I've been back home in Belfast, and the Fitzwilliam Hotel is always my ""go to"" for Belfast for good reason, as it never fails to impress. Lovely hotel, lovely staff, and excellent service.",5,2024,01,30
226,Over nite stay,"We stayed here for 1 nite the hotel is great, the staff wer lovely an very helpful.. our romm was ready on arrival an very clean an comfortable, the bed was absolutely heaven.. the only down side was the traffic noise which was very loud at times an did disturb our sleep..

226,Always a great place to stay,The Fitzwilliam is always my first choice when I'm in Belfast. It's central which makes exploring Belfast so easy. The staff couldn't be any friendlier or helpful and the food and service is always great.,5,2024,01,26
226,Fitzwilliam overnight stay in Belfast,"Very courteous and helpful staff, but rather gloomy bedrooms.    Excellent food and wine.      Good location in Belfast in city centre and close to railway / bus station.      Decor could do with revitalising in bedrooms and corridors, although bar and dining room were bright and pleasant.",3,2024,01,25
226,Amazing stay,"The Fitzwilliam was a great stay. The rooms are beautifully furnished and there is lots of space. The shower is one of the best I‚Äôve used in a while!!! Only downside to this hotel is the gym, all the equipment is old and there‚Äôs not a lot of room. This needs to be updated for a 5 start hotel.",4,2024,01,24
226,Weekend break,"Really pleasant stay in your lovely hotel. We stay regularly in Belfast city centre, but this was our first stay in the Fitzwilliam. It won't be our last. I studied Hotel and Tourism and can say other hotel managers should look at what you are doing.",5,2024,01,23
226,Fantastic experience from check-in to check-out,"A surprise nights stay from my husband with dinner & breakfast for my birthday on Saturday, 20th January 2024!  From checking-in to checking-out the whole experience was amazing!  Could not fault any of the staff!
The stand-out staff member was Ryan A who was our waiter for dinner on 20th January & breakfast on 21st January!
It was like having our very own entertainment!  James was chatty, funny, knowledgable and fantastic at his job!",5,2024,01,22
226,The Customer is Wrong is their motto. Not a 5 star hotel. Do not prepay!,"This is not a 5 star hotel, not even close. False advertising. At this hotel the customer is wrong. The staff have poor attitutides toward customers, and will not provide service to a customer with a complaint, nor will this unreputable establishment refund money under any circumstances. You cannot leave, if you wish, without being charged. The desk will not provide a folio if you leave a day early. Read the other poor reviews - they are all essentially the same--stating this is not a 5 star hotel. 

The management of this hotel is poor, the quality of the hotel is poor, the breakfast is poor, the decor is poor, and the beds and pillows are poor. I asked for a refund for the night I did not stay in this hotel. I went elsewhere as I refuse to be forced to stay in a place I do not feel comfortable.  I was stonewalled and stared down by the front desk clerk Coralie. Her colleagues also could not care less how customers are treated and ignored my distress.  I have traveled the world and never been treated this poorly by a hotel staff. I would not be surprised if the Fitzwilliam Belfast has a star downgrade, it really should happen. Sadly, this type of aggressive negative behavior by businesses towards customers is becoming more common and it is upsetting. 

What the FW did is theft. They stole my money. A refund was not an outrageous ask of any hotel where the customer wishes to leave. That is simply good customer service.  Avoid the Fitzwilliam Belfast. If something is happens the customer is wrong.",1,2024,01,22
226,Impressive weekend getaway,"My wife and I have just returned from a weekend break to the Fitzwilliam Hotel, staying three nights Thursday - Sunday in a Junior Suite on the 6th floor. This is an honest review that may sound 'picky' however there are real reflections based on my experience. Be in no doubt, overall this is an impressive, modern hotel, with all the amenities one would expect for a five-star location. However it is not a faultless experience, and for the price-point (we paid an average ¬£330/night) there are opportunities to improve the overall guest experience. 

Location - You could not look for a better located hotel. The Fitzwilliam is next door to the Grand Opera House and a stones throw from some of Belfast's best Bars, restaurants and tourist attractions as well as transport connections to both airports. You won't need to worry about a car or Taxi's during your stay.

Rooms - Our room was a Junior Suite on the 6th floor, these rooms are located on the corner of the building with floor to ceiling windows on two side views with commanding views over Great Victoria Street and May Street. Starting with positives, rooms are a good size with an ability to walk around the bed which sits in the centre of the room, a large dressing table, sofa and TV and offer modern, minimalist d√©cor, high-quality furniture as well as feature lighting. Design has clearly been thought about and is well executed. Bathrooms offer a four-piece set-up with large shower and full-size bath. Rooms are kept spotlessly clean and offer some nice additional touches that add to the upper-class feel such as a candle with matches next to the bath, water on the nightstand following turn down and an umbrella in the wardrobe. However, negatives; the large windows do not effectively isolate the room from sound and we were regularly awoken by traffic outside, outside of the hotels control but worth being aware of. Our room was suffering with some maintenance / care taking issues that detract from the 5-start quality. Generally this was minor but as a collective 'cheapened' the overall experience, this included doorframes and skirting boards with chipped paint, an excessively noisy air-handling unit  that had to be switched off at night to get to sleep and 'missing' items from welcome pack as well a slightly 'tatty' menu and information cards. The room also lacks wardrobe or draw space for anything longer than a few days trip. 

Staff - Throughout our stay staff were professional and helpful however at times some lacked the 'personal' touch. Prior to arrival we swapped several emails with the concierge who provided restaurant and tour recommendations which made planning the trip easy and each day welcomed us back to the hotel in a friendly manner. The staff in the bar were excellent and made it a welcoming way to spend the evening. Throughout our stay housekeeping did an excellent job at replenishing the room amenities and the turn-down service of an evening was welcomed. Being really 'picky' I would say interaction with front desk staff and guests could be improved - all engagements were very clinical, providing the support required but nothing more.

Food & Drink - The Junior Suite comes with a one-time complimentary mini bar set-up with a limited selection of water, white and red wine as well as toffee popcorn. This was welcome however it would be great if the minibar could include a soda selection. Overall it is a welcome touch. We ordered breakfast to the room, continental is ¬£18 whilst a cooked selection is ¬£23 with an additional ¬£10 tray charge on each order. We opted for the continental option consisting of pastries, fruit, yoghurt and juice which arrived at the precise time it was ordered and I was met at the door with a friendly member of staff who wheeled the tray into the room with a smile. Whilst tasty the pastries were very small (about 25% of what i would consider 'full' size) and only one of each croissant and pain au chocolate  were delivered despite asking for further on the breakfast order form. the juice offering was a small glass of apple or orange juice and only two slices of toast were provided and was cold. Overall, breakfast was disappointing in terms of value for money considering the total for two people was almost ¬£50. 

In summary, the Fitzwilliam is an impressive hotel that offers a good guest experience that made for an enjoyable and relaxing stay which I would gladly repeat. There is a need to maintain attention to detail, particularly in guest rooms where small issues could detract from the quality of the overall experience as well as rethink the in-room breakfast offer.",4,2024,01,21
226,Fitzwilliam is Fabulous,"What a wonderful place to stay when visiting Belfast for business. Would love to come back for pleasure and be more relaxed in this marvellous hotel. The service is excellent, the bed is large and comfortable, the food is delicious. ",5,2024,01,20
226,Great!,"Very nice Hotel :) room had great little extras such as complimentary wine and popcorn. All the staff were very kind and welcoming, we felt very well looked after for the whole duration of our stay :)",5,2024,01,18
226,Inability to deal with issues and poor customer service.,"We stayed for one night before a family funeral, with an early start in the morning.

 There was a party in the room next door from about 0130 until 0400, which the staff were aware of but failed to manage. This resulted in no sleep for both my partner and me. I raised this with the desk, who promised a manager would contact me; this didn't happen, and I had to chase them. I was offered an 'upgrade' on my next stay. Given that we are unlikely to stay in this hotel soon, if ever, the offer does not really compensate us for a ruined night's sleep. I refused the offer, and my email has been ignored.

Great location but total apathy by the staff to any issues and complete failure to address customer satisfaction.",1,2024,01,18
226,Modern Comfort with Class,"We stayed one night here and wished we could have stayed longer such was the relaxing atmosphere throughout the hotel. Dinner was delicious and the breakfast offering was outstanding both in variety and quality. Our room was superbly comfortable but the highlight in this place is it's staff who are utterly professional, calm, in control and incredibly friendly. We will definitely be back.",5,2024,01,17
226,Weekend Stay,Visited Belfast for weekend break stayed at Fitzwilliam A Lovely hotel clean and very comfortable with lovely rooms and great breakfast didn‚Äôt eat in restaurants as we ate out elsewhere .would recommend this hotel ,4,2024,01,15
226,Does not deserve 5-star rating. We shall never stay here again.,"Disgracefully inedible Christmas Festive Dining Evening Menu food. No live or background music in the understandably empty bar and lounge areas on Christmas Eve. The pathetic reason given was that the management ""don't allow music on Sundays"". Staff seemed unsure whether music would be allowed on Sunday 31st December (New Year's Eve). The room's shower drain was blocked with a large quantity of human body hair - the efficient and polite maintenance man had to use a suction pump to remove it all. Plumbing had seemingly not been inspected for years. Pretty disgusting. Bathroom flooded within 5 minutes and the bedroom came close to being flooded too. No drawers in room. Hanging space restricted by fridge and safe in wardrobe. No spare blankets - it was cold one night and heating system temperature  could not be adjusted. I often thought of Ebenezer Scrooge during our four-night Christmas break here. Corridors were all far too dark for penny-pinching electricity cost reduction reasons. Guests were using mobile phone torches to find their rooms. Cleaning and bedroom servicing staff were supplied with torches by management - they were having difficulty reading their work sheet instructions and, in the opinion of an ophthalmologist, they may suffer eye damage in the long term. Very nice staff throughout the hotel. We did not see anyone who looked like a general manager.  ",1,2024,01,10
226,Belfast Stay.,"My wife & I stated at this fabulous hotel in early October 2023. Our first impressions met with our expectations and thoroughly loved our stay. The staff were very kind, helpful and knowledgeable (Concierge Staff in particular!). 

We had a lovely room which was spacious, clean and well appointed. The evening ‚Äòturn-down‚Äô service was a nice touch. The food, was delicious, with our particular favourite being the breakfast which was fantastic, extensive and very welcome! 

The hotel itself is centrally located in the city allowing us to be able to be in the centre within minutes. Its close to the railway station and there are plenty of taxis available. 

We enjoyed it so much we are heading back in mid February 2024 for a week‚Äôs stay!",5,2024,01,08
226,"Nice hotel, not 5 Star","- Lovely looking hotel

- Check in/check out was smooth, although we were incorrectly advised breakfast finishes at 10am when it was actually 11am on a Sunday 

- Spacious/luxurious room - wireless phone charger on the alarm clock was a nice touch
 
- Extremely loud road/street noise, made it difficult to sleep/relax (we stayed on 2nd Floor) and had to use ear plugs to sleep

- Cold room took hours to heat up after check in, lead for TV laying unplugged on the floor when we first entered the room 

- Breakfast - excellent offering, decent quality, French toast was eggy white bread. Could have used brioche bread for better quality like many local eateries 

- Overall - nice hotel, experience would depend on location of your room, would put at 4 star based on our experience. Too many small issues bringing it down in comparison with the likes of the Merchant (however significant price difference)",3,2024,01,07
226,Nice central hotel. Not 5 star standard,"Central location and nice interiors with friendly breakfast staff. hotel breakfast not great (coffees cold, pancakes packeted or re heated pastries not fresh). Room decor tired robes soiled / dirty and stains in furniture. Gym is extremely small and no pool. Overall great location and nice stay but do not see this as a 5 star hotel.",3,2024,01,05

226,60th Birthday Celebration,"My husband booked afternoon tea for my 60th birthday on 21st December.  The afternoon tea was absolutely beautiful. Did miss the doorman standing outside at the door though! Maybe doesn't do this in the winter??  My husband had thought that they may do a wee cake for me as it was a special birthday as others had this in their photos and he had said it was my 60th but there was nothing - perhaps you have to be staying in the hotel to get this.  
Slightly disappointing.  ",4,2024,01,02

226,Christmas 2023,We checked in at 5pm and the reception team on appearance alone were not the friendliest. We go our room key and handed the car key over to the concierge. When we entered the room it was pleasant yet cold. The extras in the mini fridge were very welcomed. The bathroom left a lot to be desired as it was not clean. On return to the hotel in the evening after dinner it took quite some time to actually get a drink. The lady on booking was very very helpful as was the woman on reception on check out. They probably were the highlight of the stay ,3,2023,12,29
226,Cocktail bar ,"Great Christmas Eve at the Fitz. The cocktails are lovely, a very extensive menu, the staff were terrific, very helpful and chatty. Lovely decor and atmosphere, it was a fab start to our Christmas. XX",5,2023,12,29

",5,2023,12,27
226,Christmas,It was comfortable and leisure trip. We really the staff and concierge team who helped us a lot during our stay. Hotel is up to our expectation. We are surely recommend this hotel to all our friends and family.,5,2023,12,27
226,Christmas package wasn‚Äôt very festive ,"Beautiful rooms , good food and very friendly staff. The guest lounge area was very cold and you had to wear your coats if sitting on it . Limited space to sit outside of your room . We went for Christmas residential package . Mulled wine reception stopped an hour earlier than advertised . The Christmas Eve menu was the same as Christmas Day. The Christmas Day lunch was very average with more stuffing than turkey and ham soggy vegetables and 2 roast potatoes. The trio of desserts were a joke . 3 minuscule pieces of cake one bite and they were gone !!!! Not worth the money !!!
",4,2023,12,27
226,Amazing if hard bed and pillows are your liking,"The hotel is amazing and really go that extra mile,  mints and chocolate in the room,  very friendly helpful staff.   Room was beautiful, decor and atmosphere in lobby was beautiful ‚Ä¶‚Ä¶ but the beds üôà there would be more comfort on the floor‚Ä¶.. ",3,2023,12,24
226,Superb from start to finish,"A total experience for any trip to Belfast. Excellent staff, rooms and incredible hotel throughout. I regularly stay in hotels throughout Ireland for my work and the Fitzwilliam tops the lot. Cannot wait to stay again and thanks again to all the team for making us feel so welcome! ",5,2023,12,19
226,Christmas Getaway,Our stay was amazing from beginning to end. We had a warm welcome and the staff were so kind. We stayed in the superior room and it was amazing. Breakfast was delicious and lots of options. Rooms were warm clean and beautiful. ,5,2023,12,19
226,Lovely hotel but definitely not 5*,"First time staying here and was a very nice hotel but don‚Äôt see how it has a 5 star rating. Was expecting Grand Central standard but not in same league, Europa also much better.  Scuff marks on room walls (should have taken a photo) While waiting in reception for lift home we went to toilets and to say we disappointed was an understatement. The mess on wall below hand dryer like something in a average pub not a 5* hotel ",3,2023,12,19
226,Best overall service ,"The service was excellent. I came here with my partner and we stayed in room 719. The bed was incredibly comfortable. We also had dinner, the salmon was perfect. We had forgotten to leave the room card out to order breakfast to the room. We called down to reception the next morning and they were excellent at taking the order over the phone. ",5,2023,12,18
226,Far from 5 star,Left deflated and disappointed. Don‚Äôt have your expectations set for 5 star as the experience is far from it. Rude and blunt staff. Average food and drink. Great central location with great views of Belfast city. Raised issues with check out and was given an email to contact. Still no reply. Would not recommend.,1,2023,12,18
226,"Lovely, friendly hotel","Excellent rooms, staff and ambience. We didn't eat in the hotel as it was very busy but breakfast was fantastic. Whilst the room didn't have the best view it was interesting to see another side of the city. ",5,2023,12,18
226,Comfy Hotel in the heart of Belfast,3rd visit to the Fitzwilliam and have no complaints - staff are always friendly and welcoming.  The room size is perfect and the turndown service is a nice touch.  The location is ideal for the city and the university.,4,2023,12,17
226,Afternoon Tea was amazing!!!,"Went for some Christmas shopping in Belfast at the start of December and afterwards me and my mummy went for afternoon tea. We were able to book it the night before online. 
We went for the Christmas themed afternoon tea. The staff were lovely, very attentive took our coats and seated us. All the food was very good with the afternoon tea and the prosecco was a beautiful choice. We had got speaking to Lauren who was serving us and let us know what all our food was and let us know where the prosecco was from and we've got some bottles for Christmas Holidays. 

Would extremely recommend for afternoon tea any time of the year!!!!",5,2023,12,16
226,5 Star but‚Ä¶,"We stayed as part of a night away ahead of Christmas. We stayed in room 809 on 14th Dec, it had a Mountain View, it was nice but not luxurious, felt a little tired eg door frames needed painted, no hand wash at sink. A GHD hair dryer in the room which was great! 
The hotel is right next door to the Grand Opera house, 5mins from Europa bus Station. We travelled by Car and parked opposite hotel which was a 1 min walk, it cost ¬£21 for 24hr. The hotel car park was a little cheaper but you need to book in advance. Lots of nice restaurants near by. 
The staff are lovely and attentive which made our stay a pleasure. Breakfast was served quickly and a good menu choice along with a continental buffet.
Overall, we were happy but it‚Äôs not 5 star luxury, it‚Äôs a nice City Centre Hotel. The staff are 5 star and we‚Äôll stay again if the price was right.",4,2023,12,16
226,Xmas weekend Break,"Fabulous Xmas weekend in Fitzwilliam start to finish !

226,Fitzwilliam is my new regular hotel..:,"I come to Belfast for work about once a month, and I usually stay at the grand central. A colleague of mine was raving about the Fitzwilliam so I thought I‚Äôd give it a go. Best decision ever! The hotel is super cosy and stylish, the room lighting is so warm and relaxing. There‚Äôs a GYM and I was the only one in there (dream!) and I think they read your mind‚Ä¶ after returning from a work night out, there was water next to my bed, with the breakfast room service menu, chocolates and my bedside lamp turned on. Like they knew I‚Äôd be home after a drink! There‚Äôs free wine, popcorn, earplugs, a candle and matches, cards, mints - amazing cafeti√®re coffee! It‚Äôs just wonderful. There was one downside - breakfast. I was served burnt toast (on one side, the other was not toasted) with egg and avocado on top. It needed to be not burnt and a bit of balsamic or seasoning on top. BUT the continental was great, and I adore anywhere that gives me a full pot of coffee. This is my new fave Belfast spot. ",5,2023,12,14
226,Unhappy Guest,The stay was terrible. The food was bad. The cocktails had no effort out into them. The room was clean. The noise the next morning was so loud I thought our windows were coming in‚Ä¶ I rate this hotel as a 3 star hotel not a 5 star‚Ä¶,1,2023,12,14

Thank you! ,5,2023,12,12

226,Excellent staff,Excellent staff and service.  The room let the experience down a little. Very few sockets none by the bed or near a mirror. Nowhere to work either. All the surfaces were used. Not ideal for a buisiness visit.  This was a wheelchair accessible room so perhaps that was the reason. I was aware of this on booking but didn't require the facilities of a wheelchair accessible room. Food and service in the bar and at breakfast were excellent as was the location.,4,2023,12,03

226,Great quality,"Stayed for a weekend, it's a great hotel in a perfect location. I recommend getting a room with a city view towards Cave Hill. Breakfast is good, as is the bar (day and night), didn't try the restaurant",5,2023,11,29

226,Luxury is an experience here,"Checking in was greeted by friendly staff at both concierge and the front desk. Hotel layout is easy and straightforward and the rooms are really easy to relax and switch off in. The complimentary items helped welcome you. Being on a business trip helped it feel like a home away from home rather than a corporate drone üòÖ Rooms were kept spotless and in good condition.

Only one complaint is that where my room is I could hear the lift motors. Not constantly but noticeable enough",5,2023,11,26

226,Saturday  in the Big Smoke.,"Birthday treat at a beautiful,  central hotel.

226,The best stay I have has in a very long time,"This is my first trip advisor review, and I am so privileged to be able to write it about my phenomenal stay.

I booked late on the day as plans I had to stay elsewhere fell through on the day and Yasmin on reception was so receptive, warm and welcoming me in following what started off an awful night.

The room was gorgeous with a fully stocked hospitality tray and luxurious bed. And the shower oh my goodness, heavenly is the only word for it. I called down to the bar to order a bottle of wine and Brian and the guy who served the drink (sadly I didn't get his name) were both so charismatic and genuinely seemed to love the job.

Breakfast the following morning was awesome as well, as much continental breakfast as you wish and table service hot food. Also, the breakfast hostess just brightened my morning! My only minor complaint was that there was bits in one of the orange juice jars and I didn't want to try the other one just to waste it if there was bits. A little sign or something of the sort would have relieved the situation!

All in all, a phenomenal hotel, staff were amazing, particularly those mentioned above as well as the concierge and housekeeping team who always said hello! A big thank you to the whole team!

I look forward to my next visit",5,2023,11,01

226,Wonderful,"Beautiful hotel , their concierge service was amazing ( extra shout out to Pete ,and Sean)  the location was great - staff were super helpful and friendly . The only feedback is that I don‚Äôt think their restaurant  was that great and the service was poor for 3 of our 4 experiences there ( breakfasts 2 and dinner) crafternoon tea was great - highly recommend if you like elevated pub food .BUT that‚Äôs the restaurant- if we‚Äôre only talking about the hotel - 5/5",5,2023,10,31

226,Excellent Hotel,Very welcoming and very comfortable hotel. The room was well appointed and quiet. Staff are friendly an efficient. Unfortunately this was a business trip but I would certainly return to spend more time. Access to the city centre is a two minute walk. Only one minor gripe and it's about style over content. The bathroom could use a shelf or a place to put toiletries and a toiletry bag. The floor is not a good look or option. ,4,2023,10,24
226,Do not miss staying here,"Beautiful hotel, outstanding and friendly staff and perfect location. The concierges and bartenders were especially great.

226,Great stay in Belfast City Center,"We loved this hotel and Belfast. First time visiting Ireland and we were not disappointed! The hotel is in a great location. The room was four floors from street level and noisy, but that's what ear plugs are for. Breakfast was good and we ate dinner out in town. The concierge and front desk staff were extremely helpful and fun to talk to. There is lots to do and see within walking distance.",5,2023,10,19
226,Great for Pre concert event,We had a meal in the bar prior to attending a concert at the Opera House next door. Service was very efficient and friendly.Drinks arrived quickly followed by food .The food was excellent.Will go there again,5,2023,10,19
226,Excellent hotel,"Great hotel in a great location, very friendly staff and a lovely lounge and bar both with excellent service. The room had excellent facilities a large, very comfortable king-size bed, with a cool sofa and a great bathroom. Thoroughly recommend anyone to stay here.",5,2023,10,17
226,Two nights of being treated like royalty,"We stayed here for 2 nights and wished we could have stayed for longer. 
From arriving to leaving we were treated like royalty. 
The staff always had a smile and time for a quick chat when walking through the lobby.
The room was spotlessly clean with high quality furnishings and lovely little extras which made our stay really special. ",5,2023,10,17
226,Superb,"Stylish hotel with every comfort you could wish for, in a fantastic location.  Hotel bars can be soulless but this one was bouncing and, having tasted the cocktails, I understood why.  The friendly, super-efficient staff made the whole trip a pleasure - I couldn't fault it.  ",5,2023,10,16
226,Excellent choice!,"Central hotel in a great location with really warm  and friendly staff who could not do enough for you. Would definitely stay again. Everything from the service at check in to the cleanliness of the room, to the team in the bar and restaurant, to the concierge was superb. Everyone was so warm and friendly whilst being really efficient. We had a great weekend with you!",5,2023,10,16
226,Almost perfect,"The Fitzwilliam is in the city centre so lots of things within walking distance. The breakfasts are the best we've ever had served by friendly and efficient  staff. We stayed in a signature room which whilst fairy small was spotlessly clean and warm and cosy. Brilliant turn down service each night with chocs left on the pillow and beautifully laundered linens. Our only gripe was maintenance did not come and fix our nespresso machine despite being asked twice also the lack of fresh air in the room as the windows couldn't be opened. 
",4,2023,10,13
226,First class and ideal location,"Cannot fault anything about this hotel from the moment you are greeted in arrival to departure. The room was excellent , great amenities ,  as was breakfast.  The staff were extremely helpful, friendly and professional",5,2023,10,13
226,Great Hotel,"My wife and I recently stayed at the Fitzwilliam Hotel in Belfast. We were very pleased with the level of service, the friendly helpful and courteous staff and the location of the hotel. Our every need was quickly met with a smile. ",5,2023,10,11
226,Mostly hits but some misses,"Well located property, but one or two issues. First, there is no off-street portico; there is a small space for set down of guests, but when we arrived it was occupied by VIP courtesy cars. Double-parking in a major thoroughfare is not for the faint hearted. Fortunately we had arranged valet parking,but that didn't solve the set-down and unloading issue. Secondly the water supply seems to have its quirks. Water pressure was quite variable, and our friends had no cold water at all one morning. On the positive side, breakfasts were a delight, with a great range of offerings. Belfast is a very walkable city, and it is only about a 40 minute walk on the flat to the Titanic exhibition. A wide selection of pubs and eateries are available within a 15 minute walk of the hotel, though be aware that many restaurants are closed on Mondays and Tuesdays.  ",4,2023,10,10
226,Stay for 6 days,"I really like my stay in the Hotel, the check in was very fast and the check out too.
A great hotel, and the service people was so kind, they helped me a lot.

I really recommend stay there if you wanna have a Luxury stay in the Belfast City.",5,2023,10,08
226,fantastic,the best hotel with the most fantastic staff could not complain. the only down side for me was the price as it is really out of my reach. rooms were lovely and beds so comfy. you really would need to travel along way to find a hotel as nice with such good staff were nothing was a bother . breakfast was lovely and freshly cooked and you could really order anything,5,2023,10,08
226,Fabulous hotel ‚ù§Ô∏è ,Had a fabulous stay in this hotel last weekend & it was beautiful! The staff went above & beyond to make my stay so fab ! The selection at breakfast was great & so delicious! Food was really top quality. I couldn't reccomend the hotel enough ‚ù§Ô∏è  üòä ,5,2023,10,04

Nicely situated in down town area close to walk for meals shopping and touring.  Friendly helpful staff.  
Building had an issue with air conditioning and then water whilst we were there.  Hotel was accommodating and made allowances for us.",4,2023,10,04
226,Wonderful gem in the heart of Belfast,"We found the Fitzwilliam Hotel very comfortable and at a reasonable price, especially for being located in the city center.  The rooms are very large, as are the bathrooms, with both a tub and a separate shower.  Amenities such as robes and slippers are a nice touch, and having an actual closet instead of a clothes rack is appreciated.  The breakfast buffet was very good, with hot and cold items as well as a menu of additional items one can order from the kitchen.  All the staff we encountered were extremely helpful, especially Paul and Gavin at the concierge/bell stand desk.  Paul helped us book a black cab tour, which was a highlight of our trip.  Belfast certainly has a lot to offer and we will be back to stay at The Fitzwilliam!",5,2023,10,04
226,5* treatment,Incredible staff in a luxurious 5* property in the heart of Belfast City Centre. Beautiful rooms with exceptional standard of cleanliness topped off with luxurious toiletries. looking forward to returning.,4,2023,10,03
226,Excellent Belfast stay,"Excellent hotel, traveled to belfast for a night away with my mrs, due to working out the country we hadn't seen each other for a month so wanted somwhere nice, couldn't have picked better. Id seen the hotel was voted best in NI which secured my choice, a look on here after booking I seen some negative reviews and debated changing but so glad I never. From the moment of arriving the staff were so attentive, I never used the bell boy service but was offered it, the room was absolutely fantastic, there is even an umbrella in room should you need it.
Breakfast was fantastic, lots of options and you can choose multiple form the order menu if required, the whole honey honeycomb is a great feature too.
Id definitely recommend this hotel for a visit to belfast. Ignore the negative reviews.

Only negative id have is I called the hotel to see if they could beat the online price id seen with booking.com which they said they couldn't, I ended up getting Room, breakfast and added the rose petals and chocolates extra and it was all still cheaper than what the hotel wanted for room only booking directly. ",5,2023,10,03
226,"Excellent location, good service.","Excellent location for business or tourists.   Walkable from bus station or taxi from either airport.  It‚Äôs walkable for many many sites.
Easy and quick check-in.  Smallish room on 9th floor but comfortable.
Decent Wi-Fi, linens and bedding.  Staff throughout greets, are professional.
Slow, very slow elevator",4,2023,10,02
226,Good hotel,"A well positioned hotel, with pretty good services and facilities. We opted for the Delixe Jnr Suite to take in the views of the city, it was great. (Shame the curtains don‚Äôt open in an easy way to facilitate this).

Some nice small touches, Umbrella in the room, mints, playing cards and surprisingly a tea light and matches.

We would come again.",4,2023,10,01
226,Northern Ireland luxury,"A great location in the heart of Belfast. The facilities and rooms are top notch. Modern, clean and well appointed rooms with great hotel staff. The breakfast is well worth the extra $, the recent construction around the hotel
makes driving to/from the hotel a challenge at the best of traffic times.",5,2023,09,29
226,Dropping standard from previous years.,We have stayed here for the last four years and this was the worst experience. The room was booked as an executive king but we found two single beds pushed together with single duvets. The room was badly oriented. The staff are lovely but for the cost and reputation the expectations are higher. Would consider other hotels in the area. ,2,2023,09,25
226,Short Break to Belfast,"Excellent location close to City Centre, Restaurants and Europa Bus Station
Friendly and Helpful Staff who go above and beyond to help guests
Great Breakfast
Very relaxing and comfortable 5 night  stay at The Fitzwilliam ",5,2023,09,23
226,Beautiful boutique hotel in downtown Belfast,The  Fitzwilliam is a lovely boutique hotel in downtown Belfast. the room was comfortable and well appointed. All of the staff were friendly and very welcoming. The central location allows you to easily access restaurants and bars. ,5,2023,09,20
226,Beautiful place worse mattress ever.,"Stayed in residence suite with two bedrooms.  Beautiful rooms but master bed was the worse mattress my wife and I ever slept on in our lives and we're 64. Second bedroom's sheets were covered in human hair upon arrival and this room's air conditioning was broken and had been before our arrival.  For  $1,000 a night unacceptable.  Staff all very nice.",2,2023,09,20
226,Great weekend break,The hotel is really well located in the centre of the city with easy access to all the main sights. Staff gave a very warm welcome on arrival and were helpful with any requests for assistance through our stay. The rooms are of a good size and have all the amenities that you need for the duration of the stay. Would definitely recommend to others,5,2023,09,19
226,By far the best choice in the centre of Belfast,Belfast's friendliest hotel by a country mile.  Nothing is too much for the team & it shows in the number of guests who return many times.  Everything runs smoothly.  Expect comfort and a quality experience.,5,2023,09,16
226,Disappointing,"This hotel was not at all what we expected based on the ratings.  It's important to note that there is not a single USB port in the entire room. so be sure to bring your own items to charge your cell phone.  Also, the mattress was not very comfortable.  In addition, we had a very unfortunate experience.  I put the robe on, that was left in our room, folded nicely on our bed, and it had a large, wet coffee stain on the sleeve.  Ugh!  Other than a polite apology, the hotel really had nothing more to say about that.  Honestly, it caused us to wonder what else in the room hadn't been cleaned properly.  The location of the hotel is good.",3,2023,09,13
226,Amazing stay,"We were treated to an overnight stay at this fabulous hotel, the location is perfect, the staff were all  lovely, nothing was too much trouble to any of them, the room was lovely and the food was great too.
Super hotel 
",5,2023,09,13
226,Wonderful stay in Belfast,Great hotel. Wonderful service from the staff. We had an executive king room on the seventh floor. The room was a great size and was very comfortable. There was minimal road noise. Overall the hotel was very clean. Service at breakfast was good and there were plenty of options.,5,2023,09,12
226,There's quite a few 5* hotels in Belfast & the Fitzwilliam isn't going to win any awards just now ,"Whilst this hotel is a decent 5* it's let down by several aspects. The towels aren't exactly luxury & talking to the housekeeping staff they say all the towels provided feel slightly rough & past the sell by date. The room TV is ancient. No smart TV here, so no watching catch up or anything that requires data. The restaurant has very slim pickings if you don't eat meat, maybe 1 fish & 1 veggie dish on offer & that's it. The staff are great & the beds are great & the location is good but these days I think one should expect more from a 5* hotel as there's lots of competition in Belfast! ",3,2023,09,11
226,nice property in belfast,location was within walking distances of restauratns and sights; concierge was very helpful with dinner reservations and helping with arranging tour and also suggesting other unique experiences in Belfast.  Room was very comfortable.  ,4,2023,09,10
226,City centre hotel,"We stayed at the hotel for two nights as tourists. The staff were both friendly and professional. The rooms were immaculately clean, the beds were comfortable.
We had breakfast both mornings. The buffet element was fine, cooked breakfast was done to order. We had dinner in their restaurant one night, the food was good.
The concierge service was excellent. 
Overall we would recommend the hotel, especially for its location.",5,2023,09,08
226,A great stay in Belfast,"This is a very comfortable hotel . Only reason for 4/5 score is that bedroom decor is rather jaded.
The staff are exceptional. They are wiling and cheerful.
Breakfast is superb with tea and coffee arriving promptly and a wide selection of hot and cold dishes.
I had smoked salmon and scrambled egg and the egg was perfectly cooked.
The hotel catered well for a party of 9 staying 2 nights. Staff were helpful and flexible when plans changed.
A special mention for Bikesh who was on duty both breakfasts. He gave us exceptionally good service checking regularly but unobtrusively that all was well. ",4,2023,09,07
226,Fabulous stay,"Absolutely beautiful hotel, I honestly cannot recommend enough. The rooms were beautiful,  spacious, and all the little extras were so nice. Turn down service with fresh water heated towels and chocolates on your pillow. Beautiful bathrooms lovely shower and the products were excellent.  The hallways to bedrooms  have dimmed lighting which really add to the ambience and you feel relaxed straighaway. Not a sound at night, enjoy the peace! Concierge and valet service was the icing on the cake for a relaxing break. This hotel could do enough for you. Our freind tried out restaurant and gave it 5 stars too :) ",5,2023,09,06

The hotel is lovely, the rooms very clean and comfortable and the staff outstanding. Great location and they even have onsite and nearby parking available. We highly recommend this hotel!",5,2023,09,04
226,A good location ,"This is a 4*hotel; a tad disconcerting that an iPhone charger was unavailable to borrow at check in, told there is a Tesco Express across the road, then socket wouldn‚Äôt work! Room 307 is dark and dreary ",4,2023,09,03
226,Just ok!,"Shower didn‚Äôt even have enough pressure to wash the soap out of your hair (totally unusable) and there was a lampshade attached to the mirror in the bathroom that was very mouldy!!  The room itself was nice, the bed was comfortable and we slept well.  However factoring in the bathroom issues it was not worth the money!!",3,2023,09,03
226,Great hotel in the city centre,"We really loved staying in this hotel! Everything was top notch. Great food, and excellent service from the staff.

226,"Luxurious, friendly, welcoming hotel","We stayed in The Fitzwilliam  for three nights over the August bank holiday, and we had such an amazing time. We were made to feel so welcome from the moment we arrived. The hotel is incredible - so special and in a fabulous location. Our room was enormous, the bed was so comfortable and we had a huge bathroom with a shower and a bath. We ate in the hotel one night - the food was so good, and the service and friendliness of the wait staff was wonderful. Breakfast is also wonderful, a massive selection of continental buffet or freshly made breakfasts from the kitchen. The bar had live music for some of the nights we were there which we thoroughly enjoyed, and the drinks are reasonably priced. The hotel is perfectly placed for exploring Belfast as the centre is about 5 minutes walk, but it‚Äôs also in a quiet location so we slept really well. I would definitely recommend this hotel if you‚Äôre planning a short break to Belfast x",5,2023,08,31
226,Good with some opportunities for improvement,"We were generally impressed with all areas of this stay with the exception of having  a cracked washbasin in the bedroom, this was not acceptable especially considering the amount paid for the room. Reported to reception twice but nothing happened.",4,2023,08,31

226,Can‚Äôt fault it! ,"Treated ourselves to one night here while visiting friends in Belfast - our third time in the city. We are fussy customers and couldn‚Äôt find anything to complain about here! They really had thought of everything. The design of the room was beautiful and everything was comfy and high quality. Todd on reception was extremely professional, friendly and helpful at all times. We also enjoyed a cocktail in the bar, which had a nice atmosphere. Only issue is the lack of car parking but we were able to park in a public car park 5 mins away at a reasonable price. We will definitely stay here again. ",5,2023,08,28

It‚Äôs in an excellent location close to City Hall and handy for visiting the main sites.

My partner and I had come to Northern Ireland for a wedding after a busy week travelling Italy. The first night before the wedding we were very tired and decided to have a chilled night in the bar with a couple of drinks and then to head back to the room (best French martini I have ever had) . We were discussing in the bar it‚Äôs a shame we didn‚Äôt think to bring any cards with us while having a few chilled drinks, when we got back to the room in the box was a pack of brand new cards! I thought this was a clever touch. There was Turn down service in the evening and even matches and a candle in the bathroom with the bath it was just what I needed to prepare for a wedding after a busy week so thank you to all the team at Fitzwilliam üòä",5,2023,08,18

Spacious and the bathroom is fabulous. Little candles left on side of bath to light, the room is so relaxing and you could literally just stay there and not even leave room as it‚Äôs so spacious. The mini gym they have is perfect for a quiet gym session. We also got room service delivered for our breakfast. It was out of this world. It costs a little extra but well worth the experience. Thank you to all the staff as you are amazing! ",5,2023,08,17
226,Disappointing - view on hotel waste bin,"Very disappointing for a 5stars hotel.

226,Great stay,"We stopped at The Fitzwilliam for a few nights for my birthday.  It is a beautiful hotel and the location is great. The rooms were spotless and there was a  wide selection of tea and coffee in the room. Plus some additional items like playing cards - which is a nice touch. We had breakfast there each morning and really enjoyed the Eggs Benedict. We also ate at the bar two nights running, and the food was delicious, and the cocktails were made perfectly. Additionally, we had afternoon tea here and were not disappointed. There was a wide selection of sandwiches/sweet treats. We couldn't finish it all, we wish we could as it was lovely. Our server was Terry, who really looked after us and arranged for some additional sweet treats with it being my birthday. 

Whilst the hotel is beautiful, the main thing that stood out to us was the staff.  Their customer service skills are on point, they really are a credit to the hotel. For example, we had a problem with our room being too hot due to the air con not working properly and told the reception. Due to previous bad experiences with other hotels when reporting problems, we were expecting this to be a difficult process to get the problem addressed, but we couldn't have been more wrong. We informed reception, they said they would get someone to look at it, but if it still wasn't right we would be moved rooms. We went out for dinner, came back and the air con still wasn't right. We rang down, and they arranged for us to be moved right away and upgraded us. Our new room was a lot cooler. 

I can't recommend this hotel enough and have told friends/family to consider staying here when they visit Belfast. We will definitely stop here again. ",5,2023,08,16
226,Not interested in doing the right thing!,"Total disgrace. The day before travelling I tested positive for COVID-19. Whilst I understand my booking carried a one night cancellation charge I requested it be waived under the circumstances.
I was trying to do the right thing by keeping COVID out of the building.
Request was declined as was a request to change dates (even though chosen dates show availability).
I am lost for words and shall NEVER make a booking with this hotel in future. üò°",1,2023,08,14

226,Simply The Best !,"We stayed at 'The Fitzwilliam' this week.
What a fantastic location in buzzing Belfast.
We arrived by train + there is a short 3 minute walk from Great Victoria Street train/bus station.
The entrance is beautiful + straight away you see a lovely reception/seating area.
Check in was a dream with friendly staff.
Having arrived early we had a coffee just outside the hotels entrance where you can watch the passersby + left or luggage which was delivered to the room before we returned.
The room was amazing ! So comfy + tastefully decorated with a super comfy bed.
Everything was spotless + if you have time relax in a  bubbily bath !!
The bar just past reception has the most on the ball bar staff + we received 5 star treatment here from in particular a friendly guy called ' Patrick ' but they were all superb.
Food + drinks were fab ! 
The breakfast, sereved on the 1st floor is both a menu + a buffet set up.
Very fresh indeed.
I had the smoked salmon + avocado bagel whilst my husband had the fry.
A super stay + given its fab location you can't fault it.
We will be back !

226,"5 star price, 2 star experience","Rooms were of a good standard but that‚Äôs where the positive experience finishes. Staff were unhelpful, aloof and at times rude. The breakfast was of a very low standard; coffee, hot breakfast and continental breakfast were all of a low standard. Doormen did their absolute best to pretend they didn‚Äôt see us to avoid helping with bags. Overall quite a high price-point for such desperately low levels of service. Avoid if you value being looked after, there would be better places to stay that offer much better service and value for money.",1,2023,08,10
226,Disappointing,"Beautiful looking hotel however disappointing breakfast and unfriendly staff. 
We booked two rooms for our family of 5. The rooms were beautiful and extremely clean and well presented. 
When we arrived no one helped us with our luggage. At breakfast staff were slow to take our order and served others before us who had arrived after us. Food was average at best and the coffee was barely drinkable. 
Overall we found The Fitzwilliam disappointing given how much it costs to stay there.  ",3,2023,08,09

226,Family 3 night break,Enjoyed our stay at the Fitzwilliam Hotel- good quality family room and amenities. Breakfast was good but not up to level expected from 5* due to some issues with orders and replenishment of buffet items. Lovely fresh honey and cakes.

The restaurant food is excellent quality and the staff in the restaurant are very friendly and polite, as are all staff throughout the hotel.

The rooms are very luxurious and comfortable and spotlessly clean.

226,Highly recommended for travellers with a suitable budget.,"Highly recommended.

Fitzwilliam hotel is ideal for a traveller with the budget to suit. (It‚Äôs not cheap yet is certainly value for money).

One surprise, well for us, is the restaurant. We do not typically dine in hotels however the restaurant is exceptional. Excellent Caesar salad and as good a duck as can be had.",5,2023,07,23
226,A perfect experience ,"This was a truly luxurious experience and the hotel is in an excellent location for exploring Belfast. My executive King room had stylish interior design and a huge comfortable bed. Everything was immaculate and the housekeeping staff did a great job throughout my stay. The small luxuries were an added pleasure (the tin of mints, the candle on the bath, the Irish Leather bathroom supplies and various other treats). All the staff were friendly and courteous without being intrusive. Breakfasts were excellent - poached eggs were perfect every time.

I hope to come back!",5,2023,07,23

226,Luxury shell but average core,"One may expect more care to the details from a luxury hotel like this. To our experience, the service was to the level of HolidayInn or BestWestern hotel categories. Like finding molded stuff in the mini bar that was most probably remained from one of the previous guests, but was not removed and cleaned for a long time so it grew mold. ",3,2023,07,17

226,Amazing!!,"Our first time to Belfast and we chose this hotel. Wow, it did not disappoint! We got there early and the check in & concierge staff were so welcoming & friendly, they let us store our bags until our room was ready too.

It‚Äôs so central, within walking distance from St George‚Äôs market, the city hall and Victoria shopping centre! 

The room was gorgeous and so big! We had an executive king room, it had a huge shower and even a bath! Loved all the little touches such as a candle & matches for the bath, a happy birthday card and cupcake for my husband, a lovely box full of playing cards, tv guide, earplugs, notepad, room service menu, mints and more! It really was gorgeous & the bed was comfy too! 

Breakfast was lovely, we had the French toast and the fitzwilliam breakfast, both lovely. Loved how you could have real honey from the honeycomb too! 

Really reasonably priced, shame we only stayed for one night and didn‚Äôt get time to drink at the bar but we will definitely stay here again if visiting! Thank you!!",5,2023,07,11

226,Fantastic 5* Hotel,"What can I say about this amazing 5* hotel. The staff couldn‚Äôt have done enough for you. Great room, great facilities and amenities. There was one major hiccup tho. I got charged for the use of the car park but I didn‚Äôt use it at all. However, I got it resolved and refunded, but other than that this a great hotel right in centre of everything.",5,2023,07,09
226,Mixed experiences ,"Great location. Service was very attentive and friendly. The rooms are well appointed and comfortable, with a dark, masculine decor. The bathroom was also really dark and had very tiny counter space. It started to feel claustrophobic by the 2nd day.",4,2023,07,09
226,"Well located, stylish hotel in the centre of Belfast","10 out of 10 all round.
We stayed in a standard executive room. It was a good size, stylish and comfortable. Plenty of hot water and good, free wifi.
We asked for a quiet room and we were placed on the seventh floor so as not to be disturbed by any road noise, although the road was not busy at night.
The hotel is very well located next to the Opera House and within easy walking distance of various sites.

We ate in the bar once for a quick snack. Soup was good and service excellent.
Overall, from the time of booking all the staff were professional, attentive and genuinely very welcoming. We wanted to hire a car and I called the hotel in advance to find out the nearest car hire office to Queen Street. The Concierge, Pete offered to find out prices for us so that we could have the car delivered to the hotel. The price was competitive and we booked. Pete helped us contact Sixt to finalise the booking. The car arrived early on the day of pick up. 
We would wholeheartedly recommend this hotel.",5,2023,07,09
226,Wow where do we start ‚Ä¶.,"My Partner and I just returned from a 3 night stay here for our first visit to Belfast . From the moment we arrived we were made to feel like we were the only guests staying. Every member of staff goes out of their way to make you feel welcomed. 
Our room wasn‚Äôt quite ready as we arrived early so we went for a few drinks in the bar. The Bar Manager was so attentive, he welcomed us and give us great recommendations about where to go. Complimentary bar snacks were a bonus too‚Ä¶ the black pepper popcorn was unreal. The Boss Lady cocktail is lush. 
Curtis at breakfast again was so attentive and anything we requested was no problem. The breakfast was fresh and lovely. The layout and booths were really great. 
The concierge staff again so welcoming and informative. 

The bed is so comfortable and huge. The extras and little touches in the room, such as playing cards and the bathroom products  just make it more special. 

The little touches all over the hotel with the logo on everything just make everything so much nicer. But it‚Äôs the staff that make this hotel. We have never felt so looked after and would only stay here again when we return to visit Belfast. Thoroughly recommended! Thank you again Fitzwilliam Xx",5,2023,07,08
226,Good hotel for a great Belfast stay.,"We had a lovely stay for 2 nights when visiting Belfast. Great beds, good room, amazing breakfast and friendly staff. 
The only thing I would improve on are the quality of the shower (lack of water pressure) and dirty outside windows when we were stayting. ",3,2023,07,07

226,"Wonderful, Memorable and Engaging","The hotel is beautiful and only matched by the wonderful food, drinks and staff. The rooms are very comfortable. Lots of light and a large window with views of the city. There are great cocktails and music in the bar. The food was beautifully presented and delicious. The staff is first rate. Very pleasant, helpful and engaging. The concierge staff was very helpful with making reservations for dinner and took time to open up maps and show us how to get to different locations. They also told us some wonderful stories. The staff in the restaurant and bar were equally helpful and engaging. We had such a good time went back to both the restaurant and bar. I highly recommend the hotel. ",5,2023,07,04
226,Anniversary weekend,"Hotel, staff and location was perfect.  Made it a weekend to remember, can‚Äôt wait to return in the future.  Bedroom was stunning, fantastic views of the City.  Breakfast was excellent with loads of choices all freshly made.  Cocktails in the bar in the evening were perfect whilst listening to live music.  A faultless stay, thank you üíö ",5,2023,07,03
226,Well looked after in Belfast,"The hotel was excellent and perfectly located.
The room was beautiful and each and every member of staff we dealt with was friendly and professional and wanted to make our stay better. 
The opportunity to book a time for breakfast meant we didn‚Äôt have to wait for a table and we appreciated the late breakfast til 10.45 on a Sunday. The full breakfast was great as were the small croissants and pastries. As soon as a table was vacated it was cleaned thoroughly by a staff member and in fact the hotel was spotless throughout. 
The concierge team were full of chat and information. I emailed before our stay and they arranged a driver to bring us on a drive /stroll around Belfast. We were so lucky to have tour guide Paul who passion for Belfast and architecture and tour guiding is a joy. He brought the history of Belfast and the period of the Troubles totally to life and he answered every  question we asked. He even tailored the route to suit us. At ¬£65 for the two of us it was money very well spent and a highlight of our trip.",5,2023,07,02
226,Kates 50th trip,"I've stayed in 5 star hotels all over the world. Whoever awarded this establishment that accolade should go back & take a long hard look. Our room was anythingf but!! The staff as a whole were helpful & Brian in the bar stood head & shoulders above his colleagues. I was looking forward to a good cooked breakfast each morning which turned out to be very poor (ask the chef on his interview to poach & scramble an egg). Maybe we were just plain unlucky, nevertheless Belfast is a beautiful city which we enjoyed immensely, with greeat bars, retaurants & welcoming people. we will return but not to the Fitzwilliam.",2,2023,07,01
226,overnight tourist stay for 5 people,"Found this a lovely hotel but nothing special....very pricey for overnight stay for 3 double executive rooms for 1 night did not include breakfast and did not include parking, this again was very expensive.
Prices change according to events on in Belfast which is very unfair on the guest!",3,2023,06,30
226,Gluten free was disappointing,Great central hotel with fantastic rooms. Hot breakfast options were good however we were Told on the second morning of our stay that they had ran out of gluten free croissants which was disappointing for a coeliac ,4,2023,06,29
226,"Wonderful, city centre hotel","My husband and I have just returned from a wonderful stay at the Fitzwilliam Hotel. The room was lovely and quiet, very stylish and comfortable.  We did wonder if the nearby church bells were going to ring throughout the night but fortunately this didn't happen! All staff were very friendly and helpful.  We had particularly good service from the Concierge team and also the team at Breakfast.  

One of the key aspects of our trip was for my husband to eat safely as he has coeliac disease and must avoid any gluten containing foods. Prior to our stay, I had emailed the hotel to ask how they cater for coeliac guests and got a super detailed response from one of the managers.  Likewise when we arrived at breakfast, it was clear that the hotel took dietary requirements very seriously.  My husband was asked to fill out a card detailing his needs and this was shared with the chef. Our server, Lorraine went above and beyond to ensure that he felt safe with his order and spoke directly with the chef to discuss his needs.  Really wonderful service!

We would definitely stay at the hotel again and would not hesitate to recommend it to friends and family.",5,2023,06,29
226,"Brilliant hotel, in centre of Belfast","This is our second stay in this lovely hotel, one of our favourites. We had a city view room, so that it was quieter higher up. The room is beautiful and attention to detail. Turn down service. Staff are all amazing and the breakfast is delicious. We ate in the bar and everything was great. There was a duet singing and playing and they were fantastic too. 
You can pay for the concierge to park your car, which is very convenient . We stayed 5 nights (wish it was longer!) and will definitely stay again. ",5,2023,06,29
226,Best Hotel in an underrated City,"LOVED our experience in Belfast‚Äîbooked the night at FitzWilliam as a pass-through city, but we will go back to a trip just for Belfast in the future. The hotel was our first welcome to the city, and it was excellent. Luxury accommodations, excellent service, good gym, great night sleep. Also go see live music at The Sunflower. Will return",5,2023,06,28
226,"Great location, wonderful staff, luxury room","Would definitely recommend. The receptionists were all so cheerful and helpful and made us feel so welcomed. Upon checkout, I realized we were cutting it close to catching our train (20 minute walk to the station) and expressed my concern to the receptionist. She had a cab for me in two minutes. Amazing.

Walking distance to Cathedral Quarter, but I would be weary of walking back to the hotel late at night‚Ä¶might be best to catch a cab.

Room was gorgeous and spotless. Definitely worth the cost. Highly recommend.",5,2023,06,27
226,Beautiful hotel in perfect location.,"Just back from a 4 night stay at the Fitzwilliam Hotel. This is a beautiful hotel in a perfect location within easy walking distance of all of the major Belfast sights and close to the city centre. There are plenty of wonderful restaurants and lively bars including lots with traditional irish live music if that is your thing. The hotel staff were ALL very friendly, the room (303) was spacious and kept spotlessly clean and the bar area was also very good. We also had breakfast included and the cooked breakfast was delicious and served hot. There is also plenty of other food options too including cereals, pastriesm fruit etc. I would definitely return to the Fitzwilliam again.",5,2023,06,27
226,Amazing‚Äô,Me and my Partner stayed here and it was absolutely amazing from start to finish. My favourite touch was when we came back our room has been set up for the evening including house coats on the bed! Amazing ,5,2023,06,27
226,Not Five Star in my opinion,"Was very disappointed on arrival. Non of our add-on had went through the online system. Luckily we weren‚Äôt charged, however all boxes were clicked online & on our side seemed to went through.
On our last visit there was a radio/speaker. This was disappointing as we like to listen to music while we get ready. We found that the USB ports didn‚Äôt work at the bedside so we had to use the tv to charge our devices which was inconvenient. Room was clean & tidy aswell as the bathroom. Toiletries were a lovely touch. Staff were very friendly, food & drinks were lovely. 
Selection of continental breakfast was brilliant. Beverages and hot food came quick and tasted good. There were a lot of flies surrounding the continental breakfast, it was unhygienic and we had to avoid some of the foods they had touched. In addition yoghurts & smoothie shots were not refrigerated/in ice buckets so were luke warm and not nice to eat.
Online systems don‚Äôt seem to be reliable as we were let down on arrival. It was our anniversary, we had requested rose petals, Prosecco etc.. and non of it went through on their end. It didn‚Äôt even show on our emails almost as if the items weren‚Äôt selected but they were.
Restaurant needed a little bit more atmosphere such as lively music as it was very quiet almost too quiet.",3,2023,06,27
226,Superb Hotel,"Recently stayed here for 3 nights and was very impressed. The hotel is ideally situated and the staff throughout the hotel could not be more friendly or helpful. I am giving 5 stars despite having to move rooms due to a fault with AC but again my complaint could not have been better handled. The concierge was superb and clearly so proud of his city, we git route maps, breakfast recommendations and other support virtually without asking. I would thoroughly recommend this hotel and have already pencilled in a return visit.",5,2023,06,23
226,Belfast Finest!,"Just returned from 2 scrumptious nights at this luxury hotel located in the center of Belfast. Talk about the attention to detail they have definitely succeeded. Small but luxurious rooms with great lighting and the amenities you could possibly dream of. Breakfast was plentiful with the buffet and the option to order hot items such as eggs benedict, fresh fish w/hollandaise sauce, pancakes, and of course the full monty Irish breakfast fit for a king. Hope to come back soon1",5,2023,06,22
226,Excellent hotel,"We had an excellent stay at the Fitzwilliam.  The room was spacious and well laid out.  The bathroom was spotless.  The food is also excellent here - both in the main restaurant and in the bar.  The hotel is well located - adjacent to the Opera house, a short walk to the City Hall, and a block away from the Crown.

I highly recommend staying here.",5,2023,06,22
226,"The Perfect Belfast Hotel ‚Äì Centrally Located, Large Rooms, Comfy Beds, Kind Staff","The hotel is perfectly located in the city ‚Äì you're close to restaurants, pubs, stores, coffee shops... all right outside the door. The rooms are large and the beds are very comfortable. The staff is also extremely kind and helpful ‚Äì our travel agent made a snafu with our reservation, but the hotel was quickly able to accommodate our family of 7 and made sure our stay was excellent the entire time. I highly recommend the Fitzwilliam. ",5,2023,06,20
226,Utterly perfect,"Could want for no more, no request too large, and attended to immediately. Very grateful for the wonderful hospitality. Room was everything we needed and more. Overall a wonderful stay! Thank you so much ",5,2023,06,19
226,Great city break hotel,"We were celebrating our wedding anniversary and even though we live on outskirts of Belfast decided that this year we would celebrate it at home. None of the hassle of travelling, queueing at airports and the stress connected with a foreign break. Wanted something totally stress free. Belfast now has plenty of competition when it comes to high quality hotels and second to nine customer experience. From the minute you enter The Fitzwilliam there‚Äôs a calmness that descends. Everything you‚Äôd expect of a high end hotel when it comes to customer satisfaction. Staff have the knack of being there when needed but leave you to enjoy your food. Belfast hospitality is second to none and The Fitzwilliam have it down to a tee. I‚Äôm a firm believer that it‚Äôs the staff and their pride they have working in a stressful environment that makes the hotel . A truely stress free, relaxed evening and night. By the way the beds are huge that we had to use walk-in talkies to talk to eachother (that bits not true but thought it might need clarification for those who don‚Äôt understand Irish humour) really 
comfy and luxurious",5,2023,06,17
226,A truly luxurious hotel,Absolutely amazing! Fantastic hotel. Really gorgeous. Fantastic location. we loved staying there and even one night contemplated not going out and staying in and having room service as the room was that nice and comfortable! ,5,2023,06,14
226,Great Service ,"I stayed at the Fitzwilliam when shopping & Christmas markets. Location is perfect not even a 10 minute walk to the market & shops. All staff were very pleasant, efficient & accommodating. Had dinner in the bar, even though we didn't have a reservation we were given a table very promptly. The food was delicious and the french martinis went down a treat. At breakfast the buffet has a very good selection even fresh honeycomb! Will definitely be back again.",5,2023,06,13
226,Perfect for a short stay in Belfast,We had an excellent stay in Belfast at the Fitzwilliam Hotel. It was perfect for a one night stay and we were made to feel very welcome and taken care of throughout the whole stay. The rooms are extremely comfortable and the location is excellent for exploring Belfast.,5,2023,06,13
226,Disappointing experience,"Things went downhill after the lovely greeting from gentleman who organised Valet parking. Front desk staff poor- from appearance and presentation to lack of interaction or any information shared about hotel. Had to ask for details of hotel experience. Room was very average from cracked sink, empty shower cap container, paint splashes on skirting boards, poor quality dressing gowns and THE tiniest TV I have ever seen on a hotel any where in the world. We booked dinner which was Average- surroundings like a school canteen and the noise from the bar downstairs was atrocious! Overall very poor experience- will not be back or recommend to family or friends. The only positive going for this hotel is the location in my opinion.",1,2023,06,12
226,Vacation to Belfast with my wife,"We highly recommend the Fitzwilliam Hotel Belfast.  It was centrally located within walking distance of may great restaurants, pubs, and activities.  The staff were all very helpful.  The room was very nice, roomy, and clean.  The bar was very good with a great selection of drinks and food.  The breakfasts were excellent with plenty of choices and great food.",5,2023,06,09
226,Loved Belfast and the Fitzwilliam Hotel,"The Fitzwilliam Hotel surpassed our expectations.  The staff were professional, kind and very helpful with any questions we had and offered up suggestions for city tours and tips to get around with our car.  The facility is beautiful - the room was spacious, clean and inviting.  We loved the turn down service and the chocolates on our pillows was a nice touch. The meals were very good with generous portions.  
The location of the hotel was very convenient for walking down town and for getting in and out of the city.
If we are fortunate enough to visit Belfast again we will be staying at the Fitzwilliam!",5,2023,06,08
226,Very nice stay,We had a lovely two night stay at the Fitzwilliam Hotel. Very friendly staff in all departments. Rooms clean and comfortable and all the amenities that you would require. Will definitely stay again. Xx,4,2023,06,06
226,The Gem in the City,My wife and i stayed here on Sunday night to celebrate her 66th birthday and they (all Staff) made both of us feel very welcome. When we dined  on the Sunday evening they had a treat for my wifes birthday small touch which meant a lot.,5,2023,06,06
226,Excellence,"Front office were very pleasant. We arrived at 1445 and our room was not ready so we waited in the lounge area and the concierge took our bags. At 1500 staff appeared to have finished/began shift which seems like a strange time to change shifts giving its probably one of their more busy times. The changeover did however appear seemless and we were checked in in a few minutes. The concierge changeover was not as seemless as when we arrived in our room, our bags remained in the store room and we had to make our way back down to grab our bags. Regardless all persons in the front of house were fantastic.

It was my fianc√©'s birthday and we have stayed numerous times in the Fitzwilliam and its her favourite hotel so this time was no different. We are used to being greeted with classical music coming from the radio which we both think is a memorable touch given that it's rare you hear anything of thag nature around belfast. This time however there was no music but alas we were not undeterred. Staff had left a small birthday gift for my partner which was very much appreciated. It was the first time we stayed in room 310, it was still lovely although in comparison to the other rooms it didn't appear to have the same excellence. The sink was cracked in a few places and the minibar was missing an item or two. There was also an empty wrapper left where in the tea/coffee box. Nothing to complain about, however not features we are used to when staying in the Fitzwilliam.

My Fiance and I love the bar at the Fitzwilliam. We were greeted by the bar man we have been greeted by so many times however his name surpasses me. There was a another bar man which we have not met before, I believe his name was Patrick. I cannot rate him highly enough. He was pleasant, approachable and no request was too much. We ordered an applejack flash, a pear drop and 2 French martinis. All drinks were delicious and staff could not be rated highly enough.

226,Amazing,"This hotel will hands down be one of the best hotels we will ever stay at. Or rather it‚Äôs now the hotel I will judge all others. 
The service was outstanding. Beyond outstanding! 
We had 2 executive king rooms and there was so much space. The bed was just like a pillow in heaven after a long sightseeing day. 
The bathrooms were large with great shower pressure. Feel like taking a bath..go for it and light the candle they provide to really relax. 
Turn down service every night with some really good chocolate truffles. 
Thank you for spoiling us and making Belfast so enjoyable.",5,2023,05,31
226,Amazing one-night stay,"We were only in Belfast for one night, but the Fitzwilliam was a great place to stay!  The rooms were luxurious, staff was friendly, and location was great. I would highly recommend this property to couples traveling together looking for a romantic stay in Belfast. ",5,2023,05,30

226,Fantastic stay in a lovely hotel,"This really is a lovely hotel to stay in. Very central, clean and quiet. The buffet breakfast is great with a very good selection. All the staff are so helpful and friendly. Belfast is a great city with so much to see. I would definitely stay at this hotel again üëçüèª",5,2023,05,30

Excellent front desk staff and concierge, perfect location right in the centre, within easy access to everything we wanted to see, including the Crown bar.  Comfortable bed, we will stay here again when we return and certainly recommend it.  I recommend the tour bus if you're staying in Belfast, the stop is about a 5 to 10 minute walk from the hotel.",4,2023,05,30
226,Belfast weekend break,"Good hotel in great location staff generally fantastic‚Ä¶..concierge Gerard a real star! 
That said staff were generally very good. Only area for improvement would be breakfast which wasn‚Äôt quite 5 star. Needed more fresh fruit and pastries. The Irish breakfast was ok‚Ä¶.maybe better sausages. Omelettes we‚Äôre great.",4,2023,05,30
226,City Break Belfast,A short city break in Belfast. Based ourselves in the Fitzwilliam. Great location and a superb hotel. A super comfortable bed in a lovely room. Breakfast a sensation. Great staff and always willing to help. Well done.. AAA,5,2023,05,29
226,Fab stay in the Fitzwilliam.,"We had the opportunity to stay in the Fitzwilliam in Belfast. From the moment we were greeted at reception to our goodbye we had a wonderful stay. The highlights included the magnificent staff, reception, bar, restaurant et al, the food in the bar, breakfast in the restaurant and of course the room itself. All of this means we look forward to revisiting the Fitzwilliam sooner rather than later. Thank you to the staff. ",5,2023,05,28
226,An oasis of calm and elegance in the bustling city centre,"We loved this hotel! The staff are incredibly friendly and helpful, with nothing being too much trouble. The air con unit wasn‚Äôt working in our room when we arrived and it was sorted within a few hours of reporting it, along with the delivery of foam pillows that we‚Äôd requested. The room itself (an executive king) was spacious and well equipped - not the best view but not as bad as others we‚Äôve had, and you can upgrade to a city view if that‚Äôs important to you. The sofa could have been a tad softer, definitely not one to collapse into! Comfy enough to sit and read on though. 

The food and ambience in the bar were excellent (we didn‚Äôt try the restaurant) - on the pricey side but the food was of such quality that we ate here a few times regardless. The whole place is beautifully decorated and so conveniently located for exploring the city centre. 

We used the Value Carpark across the road from the hotel rather than the hotel‚Äôs own valet parking - this was on the expensive side, we thought, but the hotel validates the parking ticket for a discounted rate and it couldn‚Äôt be more convenient. We‚Äôd definitely look to stay here again if visiting Belfast in the future.",5,2023,05,27
226,One of the best in Belfast,"Service, atmosphere, quality and location make it tops. Very pleasant and helpful Concierge and Reception staff. Nice bar, reasonably priced drinks and good musical entertainment. Very convenient and accessible location. ",5,2023,05,25
226,"Once you visit, you will never want to leave!","Where do I start? My friend booked us in as I supposedly have a big (ahem) birthday coming up. From the second we arrived we were treated better than royalty.  We were greeted by Nigel, one of the many, helpful, friendly concierges at the hotel. By the time we had checked in he was standing outside our room with our luggage. He came into the room. Showed us where everything was and told us if we needed anything at all to contact him. Yasmin at reception was so lovely and when she heard it was my birthday she gave us a complimentary cocktail voucher each and wished us a very pleasant stay. What I noticed immediately about the hotel was the genuine kindness and helpfulness we were greeted with.

Our room had everything you could possibly wish for and more. From a top of the range expresso maker to complimentary bottles of water, they had thought of everything. A fully stocked mini bar right down to a candle to the candle beside the bath and matches if you wanted to soak.

Our dinner reservation was at 5 and this is where the service, which I thought could not possibly get any better, went through the roof. We were greeted by Bikash ( apologies if I have misspelled his name) and he made our dining experience amazing from start to finish. He brought us our menus, took our drinks orders and explained the menus to us. Nothing was too much trouble and he seemed to have a sixth sense as to when we needed anything. Nothing was too much trouble for him. Before desert he brought out a little cake and candle and sang happy birthday to me. Where would that happen? All the while checking if I needed anything or if we were enjoying our meal. After our meal he mentioned that it was a pleasure to wait on us and would see us at breakfast.

My friend has inadvertently booked the king size bed. When it was mentioned to Yasmin as we were leaving the hotel,  she assured us that she would have it changed to twin beds upon our return. We arrived back to our room to see the beds made up, robes upon our beds and our beds turned down with fresh waters and glasses. All the extra touches which turns a hotel stay into a luxury experience.

We had actually made the trip to see The Pretenders in Belfast but unfortunately were not able to see them as I had made a mistake with the booking. Ordinarily that would have spoiled any trip but because we were staying in the Fitzwilliam Hotel, it didn't even seem to matter. Staying in luxury does that to you.

Breakfast the next day was nothing short of amazing. From fresh honey on the comb, fruit, yoghurts, pastries, croissants, meats, cheeses, cereals and different types of juice we were spoiled for choice. We both had a small cooked breakfast and I had the vegetarian sausage which was mouthwatering delicious. I asked for the first time ever if there was a possibility that I might have another sausage? Curtis whom I noticed taking particular care of the breakfast section assured me that was not a problem and it was brought to me within a matter of moments. I wanted to mention his dilligence in making sure everything was just perfect and I watched him attend to a very small spill on the tablecloth until he had it really clean. Again, it was the attention to detail that makes this hotel excellent.

I apologise for this very long review but when everything and everyone is 5*****, it warrants mentioning.

By the time we had checked out, my friend and I both felt totally spoiled and relaxed. I have stayed in many upmarket hotels but I can genuinely say, none have been as welcoming, professional and friendly as The Fitzwilliam Hotel. The experience that we had there has ensured that we will return again and again. 

Now...I wonder what's my plans are for this weekend...?

Best wishes.",5,2023,05,25
226,Best location and value for money,"We probably were lucky with a price, but we got a weekend stay for a reasonable cost, and the amenities and service in the hotel were totally worth it. The best part is probably location - 15 min walk from the train station, 30min lovely walk to the Titanic museum, and it‚Äôs literally 2min from the very city centre. The bar and cocktails in the hotel were also really nice and for a reasonable price (well, at least, compared to Dublin, it‚Äôs cheaper and better). I loved the lobby area - a comfy place where you can have a few drinks with friends in the evening, if you want a quieter atmosphere instead of a typical noisy bar. The rooms were clean and tidy, with a bunch of complimentary little things that just made our stay more enjoyable. I would definitely come back again!",5,2023,05,23
226,Northern Ireland at its very best,We had a brilliant one nighter in this fabulous 5 star hotel - it‚Äôs been a while since we have been in Belfast and it‚Äôs a buzzing city with very friendly and helpful people. Lots to do and see as well. Great place to tour from too. We had a fantastic room and the bed was ultra comfy. The dinner (we had lamb and duck respectively and they were beautifully cooked) and breakfast were of the highest quality. Reception staff and the concierge team were delightful. As ever hard to single out any one person but Sebastian in the restaurant was just fantastic. ,5,2023,05,23
226,Wonderful hotel,"Spent 3 nights, bed and breakfast, in an Executive King room. Everything about this hotel is top notch, from the concierge to the staff, and the facilities. Check in was fast and flawless. Our room was on the 3rd floor. It was spacious, spotlessly clean and very welcoming.
Breakfast had a good choice of both hot and cold items. The Fitzwilliam fry was exceptionally good.
We visit Belfast regularly and normally stay in another 5* hotel. But from now on it will be the Fitzwilliam.
The only slight negative was that the air conditioning in room 305 didn't function properly, despite maintenance attempting a fix. We were however given a fan, so it wasn't a major issue",5,2023,05,23
226,Noisy,"Noisy - broken window - not shutting. Our room should not have been occupied. There was evidence of an old repair. No feedback, no compensation. On checkout not feedback on situation. No staff continuity ",1,2023,05,22
226,Not 5 star in my view,"Pros: great location, lovely decor, nice to have a choice of pillows synthetic, foam and neck) breakfast choice was huge, fresh and tasty.

Cons: in my experience it is not 5 star quality. Our room was unclean (hairs in shower, mould around the plug, beard trimmings in the sink, coffee stains on the wall, broken plug socket, broken lamp, peeling paint, chunks oit of wooden doir frames and the sink, cup rings on all surfaces, Mascara stains on the chair.

We were given limited information at check in e.g. where the gym was, how to book dinner ir afternoon tea. Breakfast staff were great but others lacked engagement.
The whole hotel lacked the something special (and even some of the basics) of a 5 star hotel.

I did raise issues and did recieve a letter of apology from the duty manager and a bottle of prosecco. But, it didn't make up for the issues which shouldnt exist in this type of hotel. I am left feeling I paid a lot of money but was let down.",3,2023,05,22
226,Outstanding stay,Stayed for my birthday and it was amazing. The staff at the front desk was so polite and welcoming. Room was amazing clean and the bed was comfortable. Breakfast was so delicious. Will definitely go back ,5,2023,05,21
226,Always an amazing stay at the Fitzwilliam,"I've stayed here on multiple occasions and this hotel is just the ticket. Welcoming staff, luxurious guest rooms and the best mushroom steak I've ever tasted. Very convenient location and great value.",5,2023,05,19
226,Wonderful stay,"We stayed for 5 full days in Belfast, staying at the Fitzwilliam. We couldn't have picked a more comfortable spot located in the city center. The staff were excellent, food was amazing and plentiful and we had zero issues with our stay. Everything was top notch and I would recommend it to anyone over and over again.",5,2023,05,18
226,Spacious room; excellent dinner; great service,"My husband and I spent two nights at this hotel as part of a tour. Our room was spacious. Each side of the bed had an independently operated reading light and  a nice-sized bedside nightstand. The room had an upholstered desk chair and a long sofa. The decor was modern.

The air conditioning definitely worked and chilled down our room quickly. 

We were particularly impressed with the excellent dinner we had in the hotel dining room. Other members of our group also praised the dinners they had at the hotel. 

The service was top notch. 

Staff made reservations for members of our group wanting to eat or drink in Belfast restaurants or bars. (For our second dinner in town the hotel got us a reservation at the Crown bar/restaurant across the street.) 

The hotel got our laundry done in a timely manner. The hotel repairman quickly fixed the room safe that a previous occupant had left in a locked position. 

If we return to Belfast, we would be happy to stay at this hotel.",5,2023,05,17
226,Top Quality Accomodations,This place is class all the way. It's in the most convenient neighborhood in Belfast. It's elegant without being pretentious. The staff is great.

226,Lixury and superb service,"We rarely stay in a 5 star hotel but our experience at the Fitzwilliam Belfast may tempt us to do it again. The location was perfect, close to many of the ""must sees"" and public transportation. Our room was spacious and well-appointed, with a comfortable king-sized bed and good pillows, a sofa, a desk and chair, and a large bathroom that had both a soaking tub and a large shower. The Elemis toiletries were a real treat, and there was an in-room coffee and tea service. Towels and face cloths were soft and fluffy, and there was a heated towel rack. The public areas were inviting and comfortble. Staff members were highly professional and the concierge was always helpful. Breakfast was a good way to start the day, with both cooked offerings and a large continental spread of breads, cheeses, yogurts, overnight oats, granolas, fruit, jams, nutella, a fresh honeycomb, coffee, tea, juices, and more. The value of the stay was exceptional. We were very pleased with our stay and would gladly return. ",5,2023,05,14
226,Mini break in Belfast,Everything about the hotel was great great staff were great sources of lnformation great knowledge of the various tourist attractions and how to access them check in at 3pm but was great to be able to drop off luggage early in the morning ,5,2023,05,12
226,Family trip,"Excellent customer service from the moment we arrived. The concierge took care of our cases until our room was ready, parked and collected our car for us. The hotel is central and an easy walk to the centre. We had cocktails and snacks which we throughly enjoyed. Our room on the 3rd floor was spacious and provided everything we needed, robes, slippers,Elemis products, tea and coffee. Would highly recommend",5,2023,05,08
226,Amazing hotel,"Fantastic night away in a wonderful hotel with Fantastic views of the city centre and close to everywhere. The best breakfast we've had in a hotel . All the staff were very friendly , we will definitely stay again",5,2023,05,08
226,Birthday trip to Belfast ,"What a fabulous hotel. The staff were so friendly and welcoming.Our room was very comfortable and really clean. 
Breakfast was delicious although the service was very slow. 
The hotel is in a great location for visiting Belfast. ",4,2023,05,06
226,"Fitzwilliam Hotel, Belfast,  a very comfortable Hotel.",My wife and I really enjoyed our stay in the Fitzwilliam.  Being Coeliac I had no problem with any of the food.  Both dinner and breakfast were great.   All the staff were really helpful and friendly.  Bikash and his team in the restaurant were really great. Hopefully we will be back again soon!,5,2023,05,04
226,One of the best,"If you want a personalised experience, where all staff go the extra mile, alongside excellent cleanliness, look no further. The location is also excellent. We'll be definitely be back given the next opportunity.",5,2023,05,01
226,Lovely hotel but room was a little let down,"Foyer was beautiful, staff were so friendly and helpful, great location but I was let down by the bed linens etc. The bed cover had a tear and sheet was stained, robes were stiff and rough.  We didn't use the bar but it did look lovely.",4,2023,04,30
226,Paul the concierge,"We stayed in a deluxe junior suite and the views are unmatched in Belfast, 180¬∞ even at 2/3am it‚Äôs a joy to look down a city street. Paul the concierge was knowledgeable, kind and genuine, an absolute credit to the hotel and any hotel on the island would be lucky to have someone like Paul as an ambassador for them.",5,2023,04,29
226,Good but not great,"Hotel is in great location and has potential to be great.

One of two elevators was not working.  There is too little countertop space in bathroom despite its large size.  Concierge desk booked restaurant that did not meet our stated requirement and they were not knowledgeable about  treks in the area.",4,2023,04,29
226,Poor Breakfast,"The breakfast was really poor given they were charging ¬£20 a head. The toast didn't come out for 10 minutes after the rest of the food which isn't ideal if you are trying to make a bacon sandwich. By that time, the bacon tasted like cardboard.",2,2023,04,29
226,Murder mystery package (great gatsby theme),"Highly recommned the Fitzwilliam Hotel, we booked the murder mystery Great Gatsby  package for a hen party.  The staff go that extra mile to make you feel special. The food was excellent and the room was done up for the occasion you really felt like you where in the 1920's. Lay dead drama group where excellent. Anna our hostess for the night was friendly and welcoming. This was great value for money and everyone got glammed up for the occasion. ",5,2023,04,27
226,Overnight trip,"Excellent overnight stay with my husband. I  would highly recommend and will definitely stay again  
Clean, comfortable, quiet hotel - excellent quality throughout

226,Theatre break,"Stayed here as we were going to a show. City centre location is very good. Staff were friendly and very helpful. Room facilities are very good with quality bedding, linen and bathrobe‚Äôs. Breakfast in the morning was excellent. Traffic noise can be a slight problem if you are a light sleeper. The only downside was the restaurant. We booked a pre theatre table and the menu choice was poor. Three main meals. It took 45 minutes for our meal to be served and one of the meals was not cooked properly. Would not use the restaurant again.",4,2023,04,23
226,So comfortable,"Luxury hotel with excellent service.
The staff are obviously well motivated with the aim of making  your stay as comfortable as possible.
Breakfast is an occasion in itself, with a lovely buffet and table service menu.
I wouldn‚Äôt want to pick out anyone in particular but I have to give a special shout out to Brian, who was working the bar area on Saturday night‚Ä¶..so friendly, courteous and helpful.
All in all a lovely stay, well done the Fitz.",5,2023,04,23
226,Can‚Äôt wait to come back!,"I had heard this was the best hotel In Belfast and I think it really is! The heart of the city, walking distance from great attractions like the titanic museum, shops to explore! 

The staff were great, the room was amazing, chocolates on my pillow - a great touch. The bed was super comfy. Just amazing! I really cannot wait to come back!",5,2023,04,21
226,Excellent hotel,"Really luxurious hotel, with lots of small attention to detail and nice touchs. The bed was lovely, great night's sleep, and the staff were all really friendly and helpful. Would stay again if I return to Belfast. ",5,2023,04,20
226,Amazing experience,We spent a night in the Fitzwilliam last weekend and thoroughly enjoyed our stay. The staff were very helpful right throughout our stay which made the place feel very inviting and friendly. The hotel also organised a black taxi tour for us which was extremely informative and well worth doing. I would highly recommend this hotel to everyone and am looking forward to going back again!!!,5,2023,04,17
226,5 star city break ü§©,"We had a fabulous stay in the Fitzwilliam Belfast. We arrived earlier than our check in time and our bags were taken care of straight away. I enquired about doing a black taxi tour that day and within 10 minutes of arriving, the concierge had organised a tour for our group (which was much more reasonable than the price of booking it online). Our room was beautiful and the bed was very comfortable. We had gorgeous cocktails in the bar before dinner and instead of heading out to another bar after dinner, we returned to the hotel bar to enjoy the live music. Breakfast was also lovely and the service was impeccable. I would not stay anywhere else in Belfast.",5,2023,04,17
226,"A comfortable, welcoming, and nicely decorated business hotel in the centre of Belfast","I spent 4 nights at The Fitzwilliam on a recent business trip to Belfast. From the beginning to the end, it was a superb experience. The location is very good. Service was professional, courteous, and efficient. I liked the decoration of the common areas and of the rooms, modern, stylish, and elegant. It is clearly at the top end of what I have seen in business hotels. Colours, materials, and design combine very well and give to the hotel a touch of good taste and elegance. In addition, rooms are very spacious and quiet. Breakfast is very good with a large selection of pastries, breads, fruits, and other delicacies. But the really good surprise of the stay was the restaurant. As usual in hotels, I didn't have high expectations the first time I had dinner at the hotel. I was proved wrong. Without being sophisticated, dishes rely on fresh products and were well executed, with a special mention of the lamb preparation. I may return to Belfast regularly. There is no doubt that The Fitzwilliam will be the place where I will stay.",5,2023,04,16
226,Top Class,"What a beautiful, luxurious hotel in the centre of Belfast . The staff are so friendly and helpful . The rooms are exquisite and have everything you could possibly need . 
There are multiple hotels all around it that would cost less but if you want to spoil yourself I couldn‚Äôt recommend it enough .",5,2023,04,16
226,Easter break,"Lovely hotel, everyone was great and the location was perfect- some amazing restaurants nearby didn‚Äôt get chance to go to the opera house but wouldn‚Äôt have done if we could get rickets as it was right next door",5,2023,04,15
226,Feeling spoilt,"My daughter and I thoroughly enjoyed our stay. Friendly and welcoming staff, from those at the front desk to those in the bar. The service was great and they couldn't do enough for us. 
We found the room amazing. Very considered with all the little details attended to. The bathroom was beautiful. The bed was very comfortable.
We felt spoilt and overall loved our stay.",5,2023,04,15

226,Fabulous hotel in city center,"Staff was incredibly helpful. We shipped our bags ahead from the US and bags were stored prior to our arrival. Concierge kept us updated via e-mail regarding their delivery and bags were placed in our room upon arrival. Entire team professional, courteous, polite. Hotel room wonderful. Stayed overnight here to visit the Titanic museum. Very convenient to the museum. Parking was a plus for our rental car. Great experience.",5,2023,04,11
226,Excellent overall,Hotel feels and looks luxurious. Staff were all very friendly and went out of their way to make us feel welcome. Situated in a very central location with good access to all nearby attractions and restaurants/bars. Concierge very knowledgeable and able to help with any recommendations or questions you may have. Overall a fantastic hotel ,5,2023,04,11
226,Beautiful hotel great location,"Amazing hotel & location right  in city centre 
friendly staff from checkin to Carnegie to breakfast &  night bar
Staff are so friendly & helpful parking nearby hotel do  give  a discount too 
 
A very special mention to Curtis on breakfast 

he explained to us all the local places to visit pubs/, restaurants & local attractions he  made time to have a good crack even though he was so busy he really made our stay enjoyable

Only thing we encountered was after paying the price of our room which was lovely we the had to pay for breakfast which was ¬£20 each the breakfast was excellent but paying the price we did for 2 nights we were shocked breakfast wasn‚Äôt included",5,2023,04,10
226,Belfast Trip,"Great trip and wonderful hotel.  Will definitely come back again and stay in the Fitzwilliam .  Enjoyed the whole Belfast experience , everyone was really friendly and getting round the city was so easy. ",5,2023,04,07
226,Fabulous,"Had a lovely stay here. Great value for the price of the room. Really good location, less than 15mins walk to all good restaurants and bars. Rooms very nice. Lots of nice little touches. The only thing that would make this hotel better is a pool :)",5,2023,04,05
226,Break away,Excellent in all aspects.  Very professional team working here.  Central location too! Food in the bar was excellent as was the ambiance.  Perhaps the car parking charges are a little high per night but we used it all the same as it was very handy.  ,5,2023,04,05
226,What a hotel!!!,"Well worth a visit. You will struggle to find the class, sophistication and just overall brilliance in any of the other hotels in Belfast. 
The food is amazing
The staff can't do enough for you. From check in to check out it really was just the ticket
Valet parking is handy
 Just book it.",5,2023,04,04

226,A little bit of heaven,"I am so pleased that I booked this hotel as it was not only in the perfect position for a sightseeing trip to Belfast, but was probably one of the most welcoming, professional and high quality hotels I have been in. The attention to detail is outstanding and I felt thoroughly pampered. Breakfast was a delight, with a big choice of hot and cold dishes. I was particularly taken with the honeycomb that dripped fragrant honey - a delightful touch. The hotel is a very short walk from the bus station (where we arrived from the airport) and next to the Opera house. Public transport is efficient and we easily got to see everything we wanted - we have had a very full 5 days and the Fitzwilliam made the whole stay extra special - thank you!",5,2023,03,31
226,Great location,"Great central location, friendly staff. The room was spacious and well decorated. There was a large comfortable bed and we both had great night sleep. Plenty of Elemis toiletries however the Bathroom was slight dark and we didn‚Äôt think it did the room justice. Breakfast service was good but we thought it lacked the luxury of a 5 star hotel.",4,2023,03,29
226,Great stay overall,All aspects of stay were excellent and would definitely return. Made to feel welcome and everyone very accommodating.  Beautiful decor and very relaxed atmosphere. Staff all approachable and helpful. Would recommend. ,5,2023,03,29
226,Worth every penny,The Fitzwilliam is luxury at such a reasonable price! Centrally located and easy walking distance to excellent pubs and restaurants. I felt so well taken care of and truly pampered; I would absolutely stay here again. ,5,2023,03,28
226,Great option if staying in Belfast!,"There is hope for small independent groups of luxury city hotels!!! I was skeptical about booking a non branded group but I should not have feared. Indeed, The Fitzwilliam could show many supposedly 5 star city hotels how its done. Nothing overcomplicated, just get the basics right and really, that all us punters actually want.

Check in easy. Everywhere staff were smiling and happy to assist. Concierge service was happy to walk with us outside to give directions - not once, but every time. Breakfast selection was outstanding. Again nothing fancy, but a good menu well presented and tasty. Evening meal was good, not too pretentious, and thankfully decent portions. Room was as one would expect, but extra attention was clearly given to the bed which was super comfortable and ensured one of the best night's sleep we have had for some time. Shower was also excellent with good pressure and accessories. And of course the location was as good as it gets.

Small areas of improvement to consider: more interesting fitness room (small and I would not have liked to be in there with anyone else), shelf in bathroom for our own toiletries/bag and a touch more light around the mirror.

Our heartiest congratulations to the management - and thanks for making our city break special!",5,2023,03,28
226,Fabulous,It was our wedding anniversary and the hotel left a beautiful desserts and anniversary message on arrival to our room ...we sampled numerous cocktails in the bar all of which were fab ...the front door guy was very helpful with our luggage and numerous shopping bags taking them to our car ,5,2023,03,28

We stayed in a Signature View King room that was furnished well, comfortable, and had some amazing amenities. We took advantage of the Nespresso machine in the suite and also ordered some fantastic room service after a long day of traveling. The bathroom suite was large and very luxurious. Breakfast the next day was awesome as the restaurant has a plethora of options to choose from and warm breakfast is made to order! The price was great for everything offered.

226,Weekend trip to Belfast,"A weekend spent in Belfast to catch up with family - decided to stay in the Fitzwilliam as it is right in the city centre. Our flight was delayed due to weather but the staff were very accommodating with our late arrival. The room decor, bed and layout were fabulous. The food in the bar and at breakfast was amazing. It was hard to pick what we wanted for breakfast because the menu was so inviting. The hotel lobby was gorgeous and the staff were all amazing and friendly. ",5,2023,03,13
226,Highly recommend,"The staff were excellent, location was perfect and the atmosphere was spot on. Bar was lovely where we would often stop for a drink and one night had some food there which was delicious. Turndown service was lovely with water each night by your bed and two little chocolates. There were also complimentary Elemis products in the room. Will definitely be back.",5,2023,03,10
226,Wonderful property,Staff was polite and attentive. The rooms were very comfortable. The location was excellent in the center of town and a very short walk to many nice pubs and restaurants. It‚Äôs not that close to the Titanic experience but we did walk the 30 minutes in any case. ,5,2023,03,09
226,Anniversary night away!,"My hubby and I stayed here recently for our wedding anniversary. It was our first time in this stunning hotel in the centre of Belfast. Smooth check in, receptionist was lovely (didn't get her name) Our room was beautiful and spacious with a super comfy queen bed, great shower and nespresso machine too. We had a knock on our door not long after arriving, to a girl who handed me a little box of chocolates which was lovely. 
We ate in the bar as the restaurant was fully booked. Beautiful meal with our steaks both cooked to perfection. The Live singer Owen Denvir was very good! Breakfast the next morning was lovely, the continental buffet was impressive with plenty to choose from. Didn't expect anything less from a 5 star hotel. Thank you for an enjoyable stay. We will definitely stay again.",5,2023,03,08
226,Great stay,"This hotel is conveniently located, has several excellent pubs across the road, is clean and of high standard. The bar has seating with an element of privacy, as does the breakfast dining area. I highly recommend it",5,2023,03,03
226,Excellent,"Could not fault food , room , staff all was perfect . The only hiccup was error on the bill added which was immediately rectified but a similar extra had been added in my bill in my last stay which i missed .just annoying you have to really check your book in departure. ",4,2023,03,03
226,An excellent place to stay in Belfast,"I really enjoyed my stay in the Fitzwilliam. From check in to check out, the staff were all friendly and helpful. Nothing was too much trouble and the room was so clean and comfortable that I had the best sleeps. I will be back",5,2023,02,28
226,Excellent Mini Break at this gorgeous hotel but‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶..,"Fab hotel that definitely goes the extra mile, it feels luxurious and they make you very welcome, breakfast was excellent and the cocktails were some of the best we‚Äôve ever had, the bloody Mary‚Äôs gorgeous. 
I‚Äôve given it five stars because it does deserve it but small gripes -  the rooms and some corridors are very dark and as is so often the case, hotel rooms don‚Äôt seem to think of women being able to get ready for evenings out etc it‚Äôs always something - not enough light, a mirror and plugs nowhere near a desk/make up table etc etc it not that difficult surely - a lot of ladies are in a hotel for an occasion so need to be able to do their hair and make up, so a desk/table with good lighting, a mirror and electric sockets - also the concierge was very helpful and when we mentioned that we wanted to go on a tourist bus to learn and see the city, he recommended a black cab tour which was a private driver/guide to take us on a 90 min trip around the city, he booked it for us but it was nothing like we‚Äôd expected, we saw very little of the city but were taken around the area where the troubles had been and it was very intense, we all appreciated the drivers knowledge but it started to feel very uncomfortable and, unsafe, it made some of us feel very nervous. Whilst I appreciate it‚Äôs a massive part of the history, I didn‚Äôt learn anything else about the city of Belfast, about the buildings, the ship building heritage etc and the only buildings we saw were fortified houses and homes and lots of murals. Nothing at all like we had said we wanted and I feel that we were a bit mislead.",5,2023,02,27
226,Disappointed in restaurant,"We went tonight for pre theatre and I had a beautiful starter of  blue cheese my mums soup was delicious. 
The steak (¬£8 supplements) was the worst steak I have ever had. I ordered medium it bled when cut into and the fat was unchewable. It really felt like it hadn't been hung long enough or the chef wasn't qualified enough to be cooking it.
I lleft 2/3rds of the steak and there was no offer off a replacement meall. Poorly done for a 5star hotel :(",3,2023,02,27
226,Overnight stay,We will definitely be back hotel was fabulous and the staff was amazing and so professional and friendly thanks so much for an amazing experience at your hotel we will be certainly back to your hotel ‚ù§Ô∏è,5,2023,02,27
226,A great hotel,Stayed for one night as we were going to the theatre.  Excellent pre theatre menu in the restaurant.  Room was beautiful and entertainment in the bar with the ‚ÄòString Ninjas‚Äô was brilliant accompanied with great cocktails and pints of Guinness.  A great evening üëç,5,2023,02,26
226,Surprised!! Not in a good way.,"Called in for a nightcap after a show in the Opera House at 10 o clock to be told it was residents only????

226,Very good,"I like this hotel, the bar is lovely serving really nice food and drinks and the rooms are very nice. They are stylish and comfortable and charismatic, the only complaint I have about them is that there were a lot of scuff marks on the wall but that is easily forgiven. Room service breakfast was a real treat and overall a great option when visiting Belfast. I love the city more each time I visit and will certainly return.",4,2023,02,19
226,Wonderful Anniversary Night,Probably the best hotel I've stayed at in Belfast. Very professional hospitality yet relaxed. Restaurant provided a lovely decorated anniversary plate for us and the level of service was fantastic. Very clean and tidy bedrooms. Felt very luxurious throughout. Rooms very tastefully decorated and spacious. Food was 8 to 9 out of 10. Breakfast was most impressive. Perhaps at the high end of price but did feel worth it. Overall we will definitely stay again. ,5,2023,02,19
226,Will never darken their doors again ,"Can't believe how bad the service was people getting served before us so went to bar only to be told I'll be with you. Another wait got served another couple joined us took order more people came in and served still no drinks for our company, got up to the bar again ordered previous drinks finally delivered, asked for the bill when it came another wait üò¥üò¥ put cash in the wallet handed to waiter not a thank you or nothing. Put on our coats and were leaving only to be acousted by said waiter saying your bill hasn't went through in front of other customers. Told him it wouldn't have because it was cash not even a sorry or f@?k all will never step foot over that establishment again I don't usually rant on but so ü§¨ü§¨ü§¨",1,2023,02,18
226,Highly recommend,"Excellent locations, great valet parking & super friendly staff.  They couldn't do more for us. Checking in & out couldn't have been easier. Car was taken as soon as I arrived & I didn't see it til I was leaving. The staff even put my luggage into the car for me!  Really comfy rooms with all the facilities one would need including bath robes & chocolates!",5,2023,02,18

226,Will be back,"Have not stayed at this hotel in a long time, but I will 100% be back.
Not only is the hotel aesthetically pleasing but you can tell they have thought of all the little details - candle by the bath, umbrella for use during your stay & a deck of cards.
Breakfast was plentiful & good quality. I just wish I had been hungrier, to taste the buns & sweet breads.
My only ""complaint"" is that our double bed was 2 singles pushed together. This won't bother some but it is a pet peeve of mine.",4,2023,02,13

226,"Great location, nice room.","We stayed at the Fitzwilliam for two nights in September. The location was perfect! Close to sights, bars, and restaurants with convenient and affordable parking right across the street. The room was very nice - typical size for Europe but beautifully decorated with a city view. The bathroom was stylish, but lacking in surface space to place items. The hotel was very clean and well equipped and we loved the turn down chocolates. They also sent us a gorgeous birthday cake for my husband. We would definitely return to this hotel.",5,2023,01,31

226,Warm Welcome of Staff,"Visited the Fitzwilliam hotel for a long over due catch up with family and friends. We had coffee then lunch then more coffee!! We were never made to feel rushed at all in our decision. The staff were lovely (esp Gerard ) and reception team unsure of names 
Everything was beautifully present and delicious that was my fear as i  suggested  the hotel  and i wanted everything to go well.
 My brother in law that is so fussy and very hard to please was delighted when talking to Gerard the concierge his knowledge and kindness was unbelievable towards him. We are talking about doing this again in March or April maybe dinner one evening instead as Gerard made us feel so welcoming he even walked us out the door still talking away to my brother in-law. Thank you Stacie ",5,2023,01,29
226,Not a 5 star ‚≠êÔ∏è hotel,Was really looking forward to taking my husband to this hotel for his 60th birthday and I‚Äôm so badly disappointed. The bedroom was just ok but what really upset me was that we waited almost an hour for our evening meal to come to our table . The dining area was shocking for a 5 star hotel with American style dining tables with plastic seating . I expected so much more of this hotel and was bitterly disappointed . The only good thing about the hotel was the staff . ,3,2023,01,28
226,Fitzwilliam Hotel,I enjoyed a Lovely stay at the Fitzwilliam Hotel with Afternoon Tea. Attentive staff and great customer service. Great location for Belfast and the theatre. Comfortable room and plenty of breakfast options. Would recommend. ,4,2023,01,25
226,Absolutely wonderful!,"I chose this hotel based on style, location and offerings, and my stay exceeded all my expectations. The details stood out: spaciousness of the room, the decor, the bathroom with both a shower and a bathtub large enough for two (with a candle!), the biscuits with tea/coffee, the lighting, the mirrors. The fireplace and comfortable seating in the front lobby was so welcome on damp January days. The menu options and food were excellent and the service in every area from Concierge to restaurant to housekeeping was absolutely outstanding. I hope to return again and again.",5,2023,01,24
226,ABSOLUTELY FAB!!!!! üòçüòçüòç,"ABSOLUTELY GORGEOUS DEF RECOMMEND!!! Fluffiest pancakes and the service is so quick, the staff are so nice and the beds are so comfy, whether it‚Äôs a normal room or a suite, it‚Äôs amazing, book it NOWW!",5,2023,01,23
226,Luxurious fun 5* Hotel stay in central Belfast,"The Fitzwilliam Hotel is truly 5* and a fabulous, luxurious hotel. Staff are extremely helpful and friendly.  The Hotel is very central to lots of activities and shops, all is within walking distance.",5,2023,01,23
226,Not as expected!,"Nice hotel in good location for visiting Belfast. On arrival, great impression of a very posh hotel but it‚Äôs not. The bedrooms are nice but do not take your breath away. Our bathroom must of been refurbished as the shower and bath were new but the basin and pan were both cracked. The room on the first night was cold so we had to ask reception to adjust the heat for us. The bed was comfortable and room service was on the ball although they only had one Bush malt waiting in the room not 2.

Breakfast. 1st day service very good. The full breakfast was not the best. 1 sausage, 1 piece of shoe leather, I mean dry be beacon which was salty and fatty. One tomato that was a salad type. Not hot and soft! 1 egg and a half a  slice of potato bread and soda bread with a slice of toast. Great if you want a carbohydrate breakfast. The next morning, Sunday, we had to queue to get into breakfast due to those who had not booked. We were there for over 30 mins. When it came to us we were told to go right in as we were on the list. Why on earth  way was there not a fast track queue and another one for those who had not prepaid?
At our 2nd breakfast, service was so s‚Ä¶.l‚Ä¶‚Ä¶.o‚Ä¶‚Ä¶w. Then they started to clear away the cereals, fruit, bread and cake type items before people had completed finished.  So in all I believe this hotel worked out a little expensive than  the level it markets its self.  I don‚Äôt know yet but I bet there is better places to stay at  in Belfast for all budgets.",4,2023,01,23
226,Loved every minute,"This was booked as a Christmas treat and it definitely was a treat. The staff are amazing and very very friendly they go out of their way for you from reception to the concierge and the bar staff. The decor of the hotel is very grand and dark and the seats are all in booths/cubicles so they give you privacy if needed. Really liked the decor in the room and all the added extras‚Ä¶ robes, slippers, umbrellas‚Ä¶. Loved the turn down chocolates at night and we slept very well even tho we were in the middle of the city we didn‚Äôt hear much noise. 
One thing I didn‚Äôt like and it‚Äôs not really a complaint but I don‚Äôt think it should really be happening in a 5 star hotel is that when all the empty glasses are being lifted they are left at the end of the bar in full sight of residents, this happened in the bar downstairs and also in the breakfast area the next morning, surely there‚Äôs another area out of sight that these can be left until they‚Äôre able to be washed? Also I asked for a coffee at breakfast and after waiting 15/20 minutes I had to ask another staff member for it‚Ä¶. The coffee machine was right behind the bar‚Ä¶. Again not really fitting for a 5 star? All in all really good hotel loved every minute of it and would definitely stay again",5,2023,01,22
226,Ok not 5 star,Nice place but plenty of others around just as good and cheaper. Linens and towels were hard and decor is a bit dated. Not expected from 5 star rating. Food was good staff were friendly much like most hotels.,3,2023,01,19
226,Couples Long Weekend Stay,"Very smart hotel in an excellent city centre location. Our superior king room was well appointed (very minor grump re charging ports/socket locations) but otherwise excellent. We used both the bar & the breakfast facilities which were very good. The best thing about the hotel however is the fantastic staff, from check-in to check-out every member of staff we encountered was efficient, helpful & very friendly. We had a fantastic long weekend visiting Belfast for the first time (highly recommended for a city break) & the hotel certainly added positively to the experience.",5,2023,01,17
226,Great hotel in the heart of belfast,Really nice hotel - great comfortable room - great location in the heart oglf Belfast and fantastic staff. Couldn't fault anything. Easy to walk around the sights of Belfast and always a warm welcome on return,5,2023,01,15

226,Just Perfect,We had a lovely stay here a couple of months ago. From Pete at the door to James in the bar and Megan at dinner it was wonderful. Lovely room and furnishings. Delicious food. Valet parking. Central location. Friendly professional staff. A real 5 star hotel. Spotless rooms.Nice furnishings.,5,2023,01,10
226,"At best, a reasonably nice 4*","Great location, great concierge, fancy decor.  Other than that, a moderate 4*.

Staff pleasant but not exceptional/inexperienced, breakfast a disaster (food was woeful), 2 pods of real coffee (non decaf!) in the room, wasn‚Äôt replenished (having to chase down a morning coffee is never a great sign‚Ä¶), one bottle of water each - again, was inconsistently replenished.

No bathtub, no pool, spa, steam room or sauna‚Ä¶. Room nice but not huge.

No idea how it is a 5* other than location.  Stay at Merchant or Culloden instead and get a real 5* hotel.",3,2023,01,09
226,Excellent hotel,First time staying here. Well worth the money. All the extra little touches make a big difference. Everyone was extremely helpful and friendly and the breakfast selection was best I have ever seen. Will definitely be back,5,2023,01,09

226,Feels like home,"I was travelling Northern Ireland for an official purpose. My stay at Fitz was very phenomenal. I could not be more comfortable. Over the years, I stayed many Irish hotels, each of them are great. Fitz carries the same Irish value as well. Food was just great, do not need to add anything. It was just delicious. Each individual was good at what they do, but I must mention about Shafayat, he was exceptionally caring and kind. He knows how to make you feel like this was home. great job Shafayat! Overall, I am pleased with the Fit, I will definitely recommend others for any type of trip.",5,2023,01,02

The hotel is very understated from the outside but once you are past reception it is lovely. The room we had was beautifully presented with lovely touches like the guest box and turn down.

The staff though were the real highlight. Friendly, funny and polite. No hand-wringing or stuffiness. Orrie in particular was a pleasure to chat with in the bar.

Oh, Rod Stewart was there after his concert too and was in the bar which was nicve.",5,2022,12,22

226,"Everything about this hotel is superb! I cannot rate this hotel high enough, it‚Äôs honestly my favourite hotel in Belfast","This was my 2nd time staying in The Fitzwilliam Hotel & it will always be my choice of hotel to stay at in Belfast. Upon arrival we were  greeted by a very smart & traditionally dressed concierge who arranged for your luggage to be retrieved & taken into the hotel on a gorgeous baggage cart . The hotel entrance & reception area are beautifully decorated. so chic & stylish, the ambience was amazing. A very welcoming roaring fire made me feel so cosy & relaxed. Concierge arranged  for our car to be parked within the hotel car park. However if the car park is full, concierge can arrange to have your car parked in nearby secure car park.The check-in process was flawless, one of the best that I‚Äôve had the pleasure to experience. A very smartly dressed receptionist advised at great length all services the hotel offered & enquired if we had any other needs. After check-in, hotel concierge transported our luggage (using the luggage cart)  to our room. Again, enquiring if we had any questions & extensively explained what to do should any query or problem arise. The room itself is beautifully decorated. A very comfortable bed styled with amazing quality bed linen. Our room had everything & more! it‚Äôs the little things that make all the difference, We enjoyed a few delicious cocktails in the hotel bar & also one of the best Bailey‚Äôs Coffee  I have ever seen. & tasted.  This  was perfect & earned us both up nicely which we needed before bracing the very cold weather outside. We didn‚Äôt dine in the hotel restaurant on this occasion, as we had dinner reservations booked for elsewhere. We have have had the pleasure of dining in the hotel restaurant a few times in the past, each time faultless.

226,Room smelled of weed,"Hotel and room facilities were excellent. Except for a Marijuana like smell that kept coming from the air vents. Not sure whether it was staff, someone on the street, or bad odour but it really affected our enjoyment of the room. Felt I'll most of the night and kept waking.

226,Served the wrong vegan afternoon tea - meat sandwiches.,"We booked in for afternoon tea for a friend's birthday. We had a mix of people including a vegetarian and a vegan, myself. They brought out the vegan afternoon tea (dedicated vegan menu!) And explained what was on the tray, mentioning the vegan substitutes they had used. Red flag one was that my vegan sandwiches had ""meat replacements"" whereas the vegetarian option was salad sandwiches. I had tried a bit of both sandwiches by this point and realised it wasn't vegan replacements. When queried, the staff were very apologetic as they had mixed up the plates and had served me chicken and pork. 
They said they had new chefs, new staff and they were busy. Yes, they were apologetic and yes, they took money off the overall bill however I was still sick as I haven't eaten animal products in 6 years.
It really put a dampener on the day as I spent the rest of the afternoon tea being sick in the hotel toilets. The staff were very apologetic and did offer to make me a different lunch but I'm still disappointed as it did ruin my experience. I won't be going back for food any time soon.",1,2022,12,02
226,The Fitzwilliam,"The staff at the Fitzwilliam are friendly and welcoming. Food is excellent and the beds are so comfy. It‚Äôs a joy to stay there.

226,5 star?,"The room is tiny and did not suggest 5 star quality. The under sheet of the bed was stained, the Duvet was fairly standard. Pillows were just ok. The towels were a bit washed out. The room was extremely warm and we needed assistance to adjust the temp. The concierge needed a password from reception which took ages. Overall, this did not feel anywhere close to 5 star and we struggled to find any wa-oh factor whatsoever and I doubt if I could recommend to anyone as the only true 5 star thing was the price.",2,2022,11,14

226,Room service poor .,"We stayed here last Sunday and Monday. 
The hotel is in a fantastic location nice room great staff.
The only problem we ordered room service breakfast which was not good may be for a 2 star total .
Over cooked poor quality sausage and very poor quality bacon . I know it can't be hot on room service but warm would be ok .
I think it is priced so people don't order ¬£20 a plate 1 sausage 1 bacon 1 egg and a 1 potato bread   . We ordered 3 other items as well .
So in total ordered 4 plates ¬£80 and ¬£10 tray charge . 
At ¬£90 you would expect 5 üåü  food .",3,2022,11,12
226,What an experience,"Myself & partner visited here on the 25/10/22. For 2 nights.
On arrival we were overwhelmed with the beauty of the place! Staff at the front desk were great, quick and professional service. The Room we had was lovley, the bath is deep and even had a wee candle to make it cosy 
although i am going to miss my chocolate on my pillow at night! We had a package which included breakfast and one dinner meal at night (would highly recommend this package)

Dinner was amazing!!  The mash potato OMG just give me that with a side of peppercorn sauce.

 When dining we were met by a lovley guy called Sebastian who couldn't have done more for us if he tried then shortly after we met Megan again both couldn't have done more for us if they tried! Happy to have a chat and give local suggestions of where to go and have a look about. 
Breakfast was amazing and the service was too!

The bar was beautiful had a moody feel about it but very intimate and lovley - this is where my partner proposed to me!! (Sorry to the staff who were on that night as I actually think they thought we had broke up because I was a blubbering mess!!)

This hotel is amazing. Couldn't have made our experience any better.

Well set out Hotel, perfect location, but I think the 'feeling lost'

226,Excellent stay,My husband and I stayed for two nights he was having surgery at the nearby royal Victoria hospital and as we live an hour and a half from Belfast we decided to take the stress out of travelling by staying in Belfast.

226,Decent quality hotel,"Very good hotel in the centre of Belfast. We stayed for a week and found it very comfortable. I‚Äôm not sure about the five stars, closer to a very good four star. Our room was comfortable with an excellent bed, very quiet, furnishings somewhat quirky, functionality could be improved. WIFi good. Bathroom fine but shower slippery, not too well thought out. Water seemed over-softened, hard to remove lather! Entrance right on road so no shelter when loading/unloading transport and the lay-by is wholly inadequate. Excellent public parking over the road at Value Parking. All in all an excellent place to stay in Belfast, handy for everything, and the price charged was pretty reasonable for the quality.",4,2022,11,01
226,Belfast stay,"A little underwhelming for a ‚Äú5 star‚Äù stay, and parking was very inconvenient to the point where you were really forced to pay for valet.

226,"In need of renovation, would not recommend","Stayed here with my sister as we were going to a concert. We decided to spend a little bit more for a 5 star experience but the quality of the hotel and service was far from 5 star.

The room was outdated with cracks in the bathroom sink, wear and tear on the furniture and a feeling that the place needed a complete refurbishment or renovation. 

The room had a mini bar (that was locked for whatever reason and unusable), and a stereo from what seemed like 2005. The only option was to use it as a radio or tape or to use an aux cord (which was not even provided). Most people nowadays have smart phones so I think if a speaker is to be placed in the room it would make more sense to upgrade them to a Bluetooth enabled speaker, rather than something that wouldn‚Äôt be used by someone who doesn‚Äôt travel with a collection of cassettes.

The service was ok but not what you would expect from a 5 star hotel. The staff didn‚Äôt smile and treated us like a transaction, no interaction or nice welcome. 

The only thing that stood out was that they brought a cupcake for our birthday and the gentleman who brought it was happy and smiley, in comparison to other staff. 

Overall, I would not recommend or stay again. I had higher expectations for a 5 star hotel and I think this would deserve, at best, 3.5 stars. 

",2,2022,10,29
226,Top Class Hotel - would definitely book again.,"Location was perfect. Staff provided first class service throughout our stay.

226,Amazin minimoon!,"We stayed here after our wedding for 3 nights and it was lovely! Amazig service from all of the staff we didnt want to leave the hotel bar!! Its also very central and we were able to explore the city very easily on foot. 

Hotel was generally quiet although being in the centre you can hear the noise of traffic but it wasnt loud and we were able to sleep fine everynight, air con is really good too! 

Would definitely book again, maybe for a few more nights!",5,2022,10,25
226,Best Hotel in Belfast!!,Just spent the weekend at Fitzwilliam for our daughter‚Äôs wedding. Honestly couldn‚Äôt fault a thing. Everything was first class. Staff are a real asset to your hotel and the bedrooms are spotless. Would recommend to anyone and we‚Äôll definitely be back.,5,2022,10,24
226," pleasant overnight stay","We had a pleasant overnight stay at the Fitzwilliam Hotel Belfast. Check was smooth and we had access to our room before the check in time. Had a drink in the bar then out into Belfast for dinner and a concert. 

We got back to the room and ordered room service; this was the only disappointment during our stay. They menu was extremely limited; we ordered the pizza which poor, visually and taste wise. 

We ordered breakfast to the room the following morning. It was excellent. 
",4,2022,10,24
226,Fabulous!!,"Had a fabulous stay..beautiful room with a great view over the city...the staff went above & beyond with the service we received..Thank You Orrie for all your help. I would stay here stay again, no doubt üòä",5,2022,10,22
226,Fitzwilliam Belfast is a joke,So here we go... Checked into the Fitzwilliam in Belfast with my parter for a night away and to see a show while we were up got checked in around 3pm shortly after we decided to go a scoot around the town do some shopping and have a drink together short time later we returned home to get ready for our night out. Come 5.30/6pm we were ready to go out and enjoy our night my partner had changed her ear rings before we had left and left them on the beside table. We returned home shortly after 11pm to find that someone had been in our room as the fancy pillows were taken off our bed along with the bed throw. Curtains had been drawn and water/chocolates left for us and our items moved from where they were sitting. My partner went to change her ear rings back as it was dress ones she wore out noticed they weren't where she left them me and her decided to look around the room as you normally would do our bags emptied nothing no ear rings so I went down stairs to report that they had gone missing was told that we would have to wait until the morning until they spoke to house keeping and that they would ring up to our room. Morning comes around no phone call so decided to go down and ask again. Totally shocked the fact the staff had no idea what I was talking about not to mention how useless they were when I had told them was told the exact same thing they will ring house keeping and phone our room.. Waited and waited nothing so off I go down again for the 3rd time at 11am bearing in mind we checked out for 12pm was told someone would be up shortly low and behold at 11.30 someone finally appears at our door he came in and looked around the room nothing no ear rings... Went down and expressed my frustration and asked for a manager she had came out and spoke to us and said she will try get the room searched that day if not she would contact us the next day understanding its a hotel and can be very busy at times my partner then rang 3 times the following day trying to get in contact until finally she reached her and asked was their any outcome the manager was very blunt and rude towards my partner said that only the turn down team had been in for 3 minutes and couldn't of had time to steal anything my partner replied it takes 2 seconds to lift something when was then replied by the manager (both her staff had been there for 13&9 years and had no suspicions it was them)  end of conversation was told its not their responsibility and good luck and hope you find them my partner was left shocked and made to feel like a liar the ear rings weren't worth much but he sister had gotten married the month before and were a gift to her and the rest of the bridesmaids so obviously hold sentimental value. Point is the staff are theifs and going by reviews it's not the first time it's happened safe to say we will never return to this so called 5* hotel!!,1,2022,10,22
226,Great Hotel and Amazing Service,"We really enjoyed our stay at The Fitzwilliam Hotel Belfast.  The service, from the greeting we received at check in to our departure date, was first class.  The hotel was very elegant and very well appointed. This was our first trip to Belfast, and we'll be staying at the Fitzwilliam on our next trip to Northern Ireland. ",5,2022,10,21
226,Great atmosphere- make sure you put the door chain on,"This was a lovely hotel. Organised staff, smart and up to date, lovely rooms and nice food. Beds comfy and quiet for the city centre location. I‚Äôd definitely return. Only able to give 4/5 stars because on the second night at 11:30, a male member of staff walked into my room (which couldn‚Äôt be locked - only a chain to attach which I hadn‚Äôt attached at that point), presumably by accident but it scared me to death and I didn‚Äôt sleep much that night. I was also surprised that there was no reply to my email regarding this matter (because if there had been, I wouldn‚Äôt likely have written it publicly but there we are, perhaps it‚Äôs an important consideration for females travelling solo!) ",4,2022,10,20
226,A special birthday break,"The Fitzwilliam lives up to its 5 star rating. It is luxurious with very friendly staff. There is a good choice for a continental breakfast and the cooked breakfasts are made to order.
Rooms are spacious and comfortable. The hotel is in the centre of Belfast with all amenities close at hand.
We particularly enjoyed our meal in the bar where nothing was too much trouble. The staff are friendly and very helpful throughout the hotel. ",5,2022,10,19
226,10/10 stay at the Fitzwilliam,"Excellent, friendly customer service with a very comfortable space that had lots of nice little touches. Really good location as well.

226,Fitzwilliam Delivers,"Excellent stay
Professional, courteous and very helpful staff
Wonderful bar with excellent drink and food menu
Great night's sleep 
Only downside was the cooked breakfast and coffee being luke warm
Wholeheartedly recommend a stay at the Fitzwilliam",5,2022,10,17
226,The real 5 star deal,"Having booked 1 of our favourite city centre restaurants to celebrate a birthday, as an afterthought decided to stay in the nearby Fitzwilliam overnight. We had dined there before but this was our 1st stay. After a friendly and quick check-in we found our Executive room to be well appointed and comfortable. On returning from the restaurant (separately reviewed) we enjoyed cocktails with live music in the Bar before bed, and an unbroken night's sleep, unusual for me away from own bed! Next morning an excellent breakfast with a good choice of (well) cooked to order dishes rounded off an enjoyable short stay. Staff throughout were attentive and professional. Other Belfast hotels have 5 star ranking, but Fitzwilliam is the real deal. Our go-to city centre hotel from now on.",5,2022,10,16
226,Fabulous hotel,"Fabulous hotel. Compliments to all the staff from reception, bar, restaurant and housekeeping. Little touches in the rooms much appreciated eg pillow chocolates and cafeti√®res of fresh coffee. 
The hotel was a 5* retreat in a very busy city. We had lunch, dinner and breakfast during our stay and all superb.  

My only point to feedback is that there were yoghurts and beautiful little mini milk glasses filled with smoothie shots at breakfast however these were left out at room temperature, which was off putting to pick up a semi warm smoothie that I was expecting to be nice and cold. A mini fridge at the continental buffet would be a simple solution to this minor issue :)",5,2022,10,15
226,lovely stay,"Sadly only stayed for one night but would happily have stayed longer. 
Room was a little on the small side, but included a small sofa so maybe seemed smaller than it actually was. But beautifully furnished. Large bathroom with both powerful shower and bath.
Both dinner and breakfast were very good. Dinner in particular included a perfectly cooked steak",5,2022,10,13
226,"Nice rooms, friendly staff - kitchen could be better","Nice rooms, friendly staff - kitchen could be better. I appricited housekeeping twice a day. The room was nice and big. The staff was friendly. I was not impressed by the food in the bar. Excellent concierge.",4,2022,10,12

Every trip over they attentive, happy with any advice and they recommended to hire a car from the local enterprise rent a car. Those guys were also exceptional and also had amazing customer service. 5 stars all round   ",5,2022,10,12
226,"Beautiful hotel, great atmosphere and lovely staff. Breakfast disappointing!",A great stay. The bar is really great and the bar food was tasty and fresh. The room was spotless and view was amazing. Breakfast was very poor quality and not good value. Will stay here again for sure.,5,2022,10,10
226,A night to remember!!,"We have stayed at the Fitzwilliam before for birthdays and loved it but this was a night to remember!

We got engaged!!! 

This hotel is Top Shelf, the staff are so friendly the rooms are fantastic and so spacious  - we have stayed in different hotels in Belfast and we always compare them tot he Fitzwilliam!! ",5,2022,10,10
226,Excellent location in Belfast and great hotel,"We would definitely stay here again. It is in a great location to walk everywhere and the staff and accomodations are first rate.We chose the bfast included rate and it was an awesome breakfast. Staff was very helpful in meeting all our requests, including sending up an early continental bfast on 2 days we had to depart before the regular bfast was served. ",5,2022,10,10
226,A lovely birthday treat.,"My mum and I stayed for one night as a birthday treat for her. 
The location was perfect for travelling by train, shopping in the city, and going to the Grand Opera House in the evening. 
All of the staff were incredible and their attention to detail and remembering information was a credit to the hotel. We had a lovely check in experience and afternoon tea in the restaurant. The room was lovely and we even received an upgrade to an executive room which had a brilliant view. 
Housekeeping and room service were delightful and speedy, again with great attention to detail and requests. 
Overall, a lovely stay and an extra special addition to the weekend. ",5,2022,10,10
226,Efficient and very comfortable,From checkin through drinks and a meal then a great sleep we found ourselves well looked after. The location is super right in the middle of the city so you could walk to most places including the waterfront,5,2022,10,09
226,Simply amazing!,"If you are after a pampering weekend away then look no further than The Fitzwilliam Belfast. This place oozes quality from the moment you arrive. The luxurious suite, the amazing views, the sumptuous food, the exquisite cocktails and of course the super friendly and efficient team of staff. We cannot recommend highly enough and have already booked for the same experience same time next year. Can‚Äôt wait!",5,2022,10,08
226,Fantastic ,"Fantastic staff - helpful & friendly especially concierge.
Great breakfast. Bar & lounge area felt compact and busy. Rooms a little dark and limited space in bathrooms for toiletries. Great location. ",4,2022,10,08
226,Impeccable,"Long time since my last visit but the service and welcome from the staff just gets better.  Lovely room and facilities, great service at breakfast and in the Bar.  Nothing was too much trouble and i particularly liked to lounge area with all of the local/historical books.  A great way to spend a few hours.  Thank you",5,2022,10,08
226,"Great Location, Friendly Staff!",Great location with a very friendly and helpful staff. We usually like to wing it on our travels but this time we actually engaged with the the concierge to book a black cab tour and for general travel advice and found that to be very helpful. Only minor downside was the climate controls in our room seemed finicky and the AC kept coming on and then back off every few seconds until we finally figured it out.,5,2022,10,06
226,Beautiful hotel with friendly staff,We visited the hotel as part of our country hotel and were very pleased with our service from the staff. The staff did not hesitate to offer help and to make suggestions to us for things to do on a quiet Sunday afternoon. They engaged in conversation about our hometown and made us feel so welcome. ,5,2022,10,06
226,Weekend in Belfast,"Fantastic hotel, right in the middle of Belfast‚Äôs main city centre. Eye catching decor throughout, comfortable beds, beautiful rooms and a very generous breakfast. Brilliant staff, in particular Orrie, lovely guy, well mannered, happy to help, very informative and well aquatinted with the area. 
Highly recommended.",5,2022,10,04
226,Excellent stay at Fitzwilliam Belfast,"All the staff at this hotel gave an exceptionally good service, from the receptionists, concierge team (we had a car and took advantage of the valet parking, whenever we required the car it was brought round and good travelling advice was also provided), to the bar, restaurant and housekeeping too. Our son is autistic and the staff were very polite, patient and understanding throughout.",5,2022,10,03
226,Wonderful Time at The Fitzwilliam!,"We were finally on a two (+) week vacation to Ireland after 5 years of delays - yes, even before Covid! We had a hotel booked through our agency but after seeing pix and reviews of the Fitzwilliam we asked for it by name and were not disappointed.  Hope you enjoy as much as we did!",5,2022,10,03
226,Very Nice Room and Great Location,"Very nicely appointed room - lovely decor and comfortable, quality linens. Very nice fixtures in the bathroom including a large tub that even had a candle with matches. Loved the turn down service with bathrobes a slippers laid out with a chocolate.

Breakfast was plentiful and hot items to order.

The hotel is in a great location within easy walking distance to many places. Recommended for a central downtown location with high quality rooms.",5,2022,10,01
226,Lovely stay at the Fitzwilliam,"Excellent, comfortable hotel in great Belfast location!  Top-notch staff, friendly and helpful, had fabulous dinner in their restaurant, and every need was met!  Convenient to shopping, popular sightseeing, and wonderful pubs!  ",5,2022,09,29
226,Great room,"Fantastic corner room on seventh floor with stunning views. The bathroom was large and had the option of opening up into the bedroom. Concierge very helpful. Only had breakfast to eat in the hotel. Didn‚Äôt like room where breakfast served similar to a canteen!
Good location .",3,2022,09,28
226,Great Hotel and fantastic Staff,"We only stayed for two nights before moving on to Dublin...wish I would have booked the Fitzwilliam in Dublin as well since we had such a great stay here in Belfast.  The staff was amazing...the hotel is super clean and comfortable.  Breakfast was amazing and they fit us in at the last minute.  Hung out at the bar a couple of nights and the waiter was super knowledgeable about gin...which had become our new thing to drink.  Here in the states, G&T's are not a thing but they are in Scotland and Ireland and the hotel bar had such a great selection of gin to try.  We felt super spoiled and would highly recommend.  Walking distance to lots of other bars and restaurants",5,2022,09,26
226,Excellent hotel,Would highly recommend the Fitzwilliam. It‚Äôs in a good location very comfortable clean and excellent staff looking after us. A modern but small boutique style feel to the place. We only had breakfast in the hotel which was very good. ,5,2022,09,26
226,"Superb location, excellent service!","We stayed at the Fitzwillam for 3 nights, celebrating my 60th birthday and were delighted with our choice, the hotel is fantastic, the staff were brilliant and the nice touch of birthday treats and card in our room, was very much appreciated.
There is on site valet parking, however it was full when we arrived, so we used the public car park, literally across the road, which proved perfectly fine.
The concierge were very helpful and we had lunch in the hotel bar, which was very good, a perfect location for exploring Belfast.",5,2022,09,25
226,Excellent,"Super nice hotel, extremely comfortable rooms, good sized and beautifully designed. Bath and shower in the ensuite. Fresh milk delivered to the room if you want it. Breakfast was nice, service a little mixed, but a good range of options alongside a continental buffet. Declan the doorman is brilliant, so hospitable. Will definitely be back, I wouldn't stay anywhere else.",5,2022,09,25
226,"Elegant, comfortable and welcoming","An absolutely beautiful hotel. Pure luxury without any snobbery! I felt welcome and well looked after. Small touches made all the difference, for example coming back to the room after a family wedding in another location to find the bed turned down, bedside lamps on, robes & slippers waiting at the bed, bottles of water and glasses, and a little box of chocolates. The service at breakfast was a little slow, but the quality and range of food more than made up for it. Can't wait to return!",5,2022,09,25
226,Really special stay,"We found the accommodation, ambience and service from welcoming staff at Fitzwilliam very special. The room was gorgeous, Classic FM playing in room when we arrived I thought was a really nice touch, turn down service too! Staff so pleasant and helpful. Breakfast offering excellent, had a brilliant stay altogether!",5,2022,09,24
226,"Friendly hotel, amazing cocktails!","The staff are so friendly here, this is the second time I have stayed at the hotel and the cocktails are highly recommend. The food is also amazing you can't fault the service, I will stay again as it's clean and comfortable.",5,2022,09,23
226,Great friendly hotel,"Staff so helpful , very welcoming , nothing is a bother.
Beautiful decor throughout the hotel.
Comfy rooms and tasty breakfast 
Great location next to train/bus station and close to shops and bars.
Will definitely be back 
",5,2022,09,21
226,Mr McGarrigle.,Stayed for my mother's 70th birthday they over charged us 50 pound for dinner 144 for 2 people eating and the refund process is a disaster and blaming everything instead of taking responsibility themselves first and last time staying here.,1,2022,09,21
226,Relaxing Weekend,"Great Hotel in centre of Belfast, warm friendly atmosphere, Staff were friendly and helpful. Located close to bus and train station. Within walking distant to City Hall and main shopping area. Would definitely go back again.",5,2022,09,20
226,Well situated to walk around city centre.,"This hotel is a good place to stay if you are visiting Belfast.  If you enjoy walking, it is easy to get to the Tourist Info office, City Hall, shopping, restaurants and pubs, etc...  Walking to the river takes a bit longer but is not strenuous.  We were a bit disappointed with the breakfast offerings and the service but this is probably the new reality of travel.  The bed was comfortable.  The bathroom is spacious but not a lot of room to place toiletries.  The closet was spacious.  Robes and slippers were provided.  Parking across the street was a bit inconvenient.  Overall, a perfectly fine place to stay for a night or two.",3,2022,09,20
226,Very Central,"Stayed 3-nights at the Fitzwilliam, which is within easy walking distance of Belfast‚Äôs many attractions. Our room was comfortable & spotlessly clean, with a fantastic view of the Belfast Hills. Looking at the outline it is easy to see how Jonathan Swift could have used the hills as his inspiration for Gulliver‚Äôs Travels. Breakfast was ¬£20 extra per person on top of what was not a cheap room rate so we ventured out & found some wonderful eateries around the city. We had a drink in the Hotel Bar but the service was so poor we wish we hadn‚Äôt bothered. Overall, The Fitzwilliam provided a good comfortable base but in our experience much better to venture out to eat & drink.",4,2022,09,17
226,Lives up to its 5 star rating!,This was my first time to stay at the Fitzwilliam Hotel in Belfast and it most certainly won‚Äôt be my last! I was complimentary upgraded both nights which was a pleasant surprise. The service level was excellent as was the food. Staff were extremely helpful and professional and it‚Äôs obvious that training of the staff is taken to the highest level. I was in Belfast for business and would have no hesitation in staying again for business or leisure.,5,2022,09,17
226,Upscale Hotel in belfast,A luxury hotel in the middle of Belfast. From our first steps inside the lobby to when we left it was gorgeous. We stayed in a standard room which was spacious and very luxurious.. I would love to see what the suites were like. Highly recommend staying here,5,2022,09,17
226,Outstanding hotel in downtown Belfast!,"The location and service at this outstanding hotel make this an ideal setting for a wonderful stay! Close to everything including The Opera House, great shopping, restaurants and tour buses. The staff cannot do enough for you! ",5,2022,09,17
226,Protest for free parking,"Hotel amazing..
Only downfall is the bill was an extortionate rate for parking. Hotel would be 10/10 if parking was complimentary.
Cost of hotel is expensive enough without having to pay an extra ¬£25
Per day for parking.",4,2022,09,16
226,Not a 5 star breakfast,"Had a nice overnight stay at this 5 star hotel, great location, lovely clean rooms as what you would expect for the price.  We booked a deal with 2 course meal for 2 people, at the restaurant there was an issue with the menu as we were going to be charged again full price for the food, luckily this was pointed out to the server in time, which caused embarrassment.  The food was nice, but nothing special for a 5 star hotel. Breakfast next morning was very poor, Ive had better in a cheap bed and breakfast.  There was a good selection of pastries, cereals etc, we choose the full cooked breakfast, it was very sparse and not great quality.  My one slice of bacon was like old shoe leather and the knife would not go through it.  I did mention it to the young server who I believe did mention it to the kitchen staff as she went threw.  We mentioned to the receptionist in the morning regarding the embarrassment at dinner, she agreed customers should be made aware more of terms and conditions when booking a special meal package, they certainly dont come cheap either, so she took 2 drinks price off our bill which was a nice gesture.  It‚Äôs a beautiful hotel, seen as a special treat for us, which was spoilt by the dinner and the poor breakfast.",4,2022,09,12
226,Three night stay at the Fitzwilliam,"Three night break in Belfast. Hotel superb, location perfect for city break. All the staff were so helpful. Could not fault a thing. Breakfast and dinner excellent, staff well trained, smart and polite. ",5,2022,09,12
226,"Broken air conditioning, indifferent staff and hidden costs","I booked a signature view room for two nights back in July through the website for my partners 30th birthday. During the booking process there was an option to add a bottle champagne for the room which was added on to the total cost of the booking. So we arrived on Friday and check in went smoothly and everything was going well. Friday night when going to bed we found that the room was incredibly warm but the air conditioning was broken, we phone down to the concierge and they tell us that they can‚Äôt fix it and they would need to get an engineer out to deal with it. We ended up sleeping in a very hot stuffy room for both nights of our stay, no apologies or anything. We also found that there was a lot of outside noise from the corridors in the morning. This left us both with hardly any sleep and feeling very uncomfortable. 

Breakfast the next day was another let down, it took 20 minutes for us to be seated and even longer for us to be brought tea, coffee and the hot food we ordered which was served by an indifferent staff member who didn‚Äôt seem to care at all. The continental breakfast was basically empty and wasn‚Äôt replenished even though we arrived well within the breakfast serving hours. 

Now here is for the part I am really annoyed about. When we were checking out I was told I hadn‚Äôt paid for the price of the champagne even though when I booked the price for champagne was totalled up with the price of the room, so I ended up paying ¬£90 extra on top of the already astronomical price. I would not have paid the price I did if I had known that the champagne wasn‚Äôt included considering how bad the service was and that we would be staying in a room with broken fixtures without any offer of compensation. It ruined my experience, I would not recommend to anyone and I would not stay at the hotel again.",1,2022,09,12
226,Best hotel in Belfast,"Best hotel in Belfast. Friendly staff, exceptional hotel  great location. A real  piece of luxury. I would highly recommend the Fitzwilliam hotel to anyone staying in Belfast. Food and drink were devine",5,2022,09,12
226,Wonderful place to stay in Belfast,"Our room was very luxurious and well maintained.  Well above expectations.  Restaurant is a good choice for food and service quality.  The locations is near a lot of restaurants and pubs, a short walk from City Hall and some other places of interest.  Staff is friendly, efficient, and seems to care about what they do.  ",5,2022,09,11
226,Excellent 5 star Hotel.,"A top quality 5 star hotel. Everything you would expect, and more from a high end hotel. The staff were very friendly, and the service was excellent. The location was perfect for anyone looking for a break in the City centre. ",5,2022,09,08
226,The only place I would stay in Belfast,The Fitzwilliam is a lovely 5 star hotel with excellent service and delightful rooms centrally located within walking distance of all the major attractions.  The concierge was very helpful in booking attractions and advising on laundry service. ,5,2022,09,07
226,Wonderful hotel,"My wife and I stayed here for four nights to spend some time visiting Belfast. We had stayed a few years before at the Fitzwilliam Dublin Hotel, so were quick to pick this sister hotel in Belfast.  And we were not disappointed, as our entire experience was excellent. The room was nice and airy, and the service was always responsive and friendly.  The location is really good, near city hall, close to some famous pubs, but quiet. The breakfast was excellent and we enjoyed the lobby.  We also used the concierge, Phillip, several times and he gave us some great restaurant and other activity recommendations, and made us reservations also.  We would definitely go back!",5,2022,09,06
226,Wonderful stay!,"Had a great stayacation for my birthday. Staff was very friendly, rooms were nice and super clean. They even complied with my ridiculous birthday request and even left me a birthday cupcake. Worth the money! :)

226,Anniversary stay,"Such a Lovely hotel, nice bar and excellent friendly staff, luxurious and spacious rooms with a lovely touch of having room turned down and chocolates on the pillows at night! Great location for city centre ",5,2022,09,05
226,Service with a smile,Lovely hotel within walking distance to the city centre. Our compliments to the staff for their polite prompt professional service at every point of our trip. The room was excellent and very well appointed with lovely views over the city. The breakfast was especially good with great variety and everything served as it should. Thank you for a memorable stay in Belfast. ,5,2022,09,04
226,Nice hotel in great location - especially for the Grand Opera House,"Had a lovely stay in the Fitzwilliam Hotel.  Slightly embarrassed to say that we did not travel very far but testament to the brilliant location.  We crossed over Great Victoria Street to go to a lovely tapas restaurant Ora, crossed back over the road and went next door to the Opera House - Shane Tood brilliant - and then back next door to the Fitzwilliam.  As we lived in Belfast for many years we know the city.  Other visitors might want to walk more.  It is a very walkable city.  BTW for travellers from the South the access to the hotel is simple.   Grosvenor Road exit off Motorway and it is right in front of you.  Public multi-storey opposite the hotel.  Could not be simpler and reasonable compared to Dublin.  The hotel rooms are lovely.  A few minor issues - given wrong room and was told it was an upgrade - room price I paid was higher than what was available on the day - price match would have been nice - I don't like porters taking my bag as I don't carry cash - and a 10 pound charge or late check out is petty and unnecessary.  I heard the doorman and others greet guests by their name.  I didn't get the same greeting.  I probably prefer it that way :-)  So if you are going to the Opera House this is the perfect location.  And the Opera House is truly stunning.  First time visiting in 20+ years and I am just so impressed with its refurbishment. ",4,2022,09,04
226,The Best!,"This was our first visit to Belfast. The staff were excellent in all respects. Welcoming, helpful and yet very professional. The bar is well stocked and perfect for an evening meal or a nightcap. The hotel is also in an excellent location for visiting Belfast. ",5,2022,09,03
226,Wonderful Hotel,"This hotel is one of the most relaxing we have stayed in.  From check-in to check-out we were so chilled. We stayed in a Signature view room which was lovely.  Staff are very professional and friendly with nothing being too much trouble.  Also house keeping is excellent with guest rooms (along with common areas) always spotless. I must mention Brian in the bar for he is a gentleman who genuinely strives to ensure you have the best possible experience. Thank you Brian. 
We will certainly return to Belfast for it is a buzzing city with lovely people and without question stay at the Fitzwilliam again.",5,2022,08,31
226,Amazing,"Brilliant place, welcoming staff. Drinks and food are amazing. I have since stayed again since my Friday time and plan to many more. Great in city centre and close to everything. So helpful Staff and beautiful courtyard. Absolutely love this hotel",5,2022,08,31

226,5 star staff made the evening,"We were in the bar to listen to a great band. We were shown seats and received our drinks by a very attentive duty manager.
Throughout the whole evening the team that were looking after their customers could not have been more professional and were a credit to the hotel.
They all worked with pace and purpose and left no customer unattended or waiting if something was needed.
I have never written a review before to compliment just the efficiency and enthusiasm shown by bar staff.
I hope they are appreciated by the hotel!",5,2022,08,28

Rooms are excellent with a super comfy bed, nice bathroom, love the turn down service with choccies and room cleaned each day - the only thing that let it down was the breakfast, although the taste was good, it was very dry ! No beans or tomatoes on the plate and one small mushroom, the soda farl was virtually unbreakable - having said that I‚Äôd definitely stay again but would go elsewhere for breakfast ",4,2022,08,22

226,Me Time,"Had an excellent stay in this beautiful hotel. The staff were amazing and catered for our every need. The hotel itself was beautiful, clean and restful.

Rooms lovely with a comfy bed and great pillows, room service very attentive turning beds down at night and leaving extra water and chocolates- little touches that confirm your staying in a five star hotel.

Breakfast each morning was fantastic great service choice and selection. We struggled one night to get a restaurant reserved for tea so decided to eat in the hotel bar - tbh wished we had done this earlier in the week food was amazing Megan and the staff super friendly and chatty.

Definitely will be coming back with our boys to explore more.

Thank you for a wonderful stay!",5,2022,08,12
226,These concierges are the ones they used to write movies about,"In today's world, service, unfortunately, ""is not what it used to be.""  Well, fortunately, that cannot be said about the concierge service here.  I am a seasoned traveler and all the concierges were great, but two - Gerald and Philip went far beyond the call of service.

We were staying here prior to a cruise.  There was a Covid test requirement by the cruise line which, given all the flight cancellations and delays, made conforming difficult.

Worsening the situation, the cruise representative lacked testing information.  Gerald stepped in, found a site, filled out the online form and arranged for a taxi to take us there, remain and take us back.  He was a life-saver and spared us much stress, aggravation and despair.

Unfortunately, the testing company did not send my results.  We called the hotel and Philip took charge.  We went immediately to the hotel.  Philip had already called the company, found our results and had the emailed , all by the time we returned.  

If you are in Belfast, stay here.  If anything goes awry, and today you can expect something, you will be happy you did,  I cannot tell you how grateful we are to these two professionals.",5,2022,08,11
226,Mixed Feelings,"Extreme experiences.  Great location and views.  I don't want to see a previous guest's hair on the shower for 2 days in a row in spite of bringing it to the hotel's attention.  I would have expected some type of compensation.
Close to everything: Opera House, bus station to airport, restaurants",3,2022,08,11

226,"Spacious rooms, modern and excellent location","Cleanliness: very clean
 
Sleep Quality: very comfortable beds
 
Amenities: very functional room.
 
Staff/Service: very pleasant and helpful staff, especially Phillip at the concierge
 
Property/Facilities: the valet is a problem. They ask you to reserve it before arrival, which we did, but the valet parking was full as we arrived early before 12 noon, so they asked us to park across the street in public parking instead until 3 pm ( they checked us in early at 11:30 though, but not the car). Very inconvenience with large luggage.
 
Location: perfect location with walking distance to majority of points of interests except the Titanic Square (25 minutes‚Äô walk)

226,The hotel to stay in Belfast.,"This hotel offers very professional and friendly service.   From concierge and front desk to the restaurant, everyone here is on top of their game. We loved our stay right in the heart of the city center.  Breakfasts are delicious, rooms  provide all necessities including water, cookies and thoughtful visitor gifts.   Bathrooms have enormous tubs with a candle for a perfect soak after walking around all day. Doesn‚Äôt get better!",5,2022,08,05
226,Special wedding anniversary stay,"I booked our stay at the Fitzwilliam as we were going to the GOH. My wife has always said that she wanted to stay in the Fitzwilliam, so because we hadn‚Äôt been away the past couple of years due to Covid, I booked  a suite as a proper treat. Even before we arrived things didn‚Äôt go to plan. I emailed the concierge to book a table for dinner before our show in the GOH. I did not even get a reply from them. This was sorted when we checked in. No real drama. Then we went up to our suite and when you walk in, you do get the waoh factor. Stunning room with great views over Belfast. Then you sit down to have a proper look around the room and you see all wee imperfections. Ceiling cracked with plaster hanging down, make up all over light shades at bed, sink cracked and the carpet in the room could do with a serious clean. Then we get to dinner, we were the only 2 people in the restaurant. My wife orders a chicken dish and when it comes, she lifts one bit of chicken off the other and there is a hair underneath. The waiter could not be anymore apologetic and said he would replace the meal. I then had to eat my meal myself while my wife sat waiting on hers. I had finished my meal before my wife‚Äôs new meal arrived. By the time that my wife‚Äôs meal arrived she didn‚Äôt really want to eat it. All these things for us would of been ok in most other hotel rooms in Belfast, but for us this was meant to be an amazing night in a suite and as the Fitzwilliam is meant to be one of the best hotels, we felt like we personally did not get the 5* experience. My wife‚Äôs words were, they say don‚Äôt meet your idol as you will be disappointed and unfortunately we were. The positives we saw in the Fitzwilliam was the staff and the breakfast which was amazing.",1,2022,08,05
226,Beautiful hotel,Everything about this hotel was spectacular. Gavin at the bell service/concierge was the best and helped us so much. Everyone was friendly. Rooms were amazing and service was top notch. We would stay here again. ,5,2022,08,05

226,A Lovely Stay,"My husband and I have just returned after 4 days in Belfast and had a lovely stay at the Fitzwilliam. The location is perfect, walking distance to everywhere. The staff were welcoming and couldn‚Äôt do enough for you (stored our bags on arrival to let us explore while room was being prepared,  feather pillows on request, ice buckets, wee jug of milk for tea in room etc) We had breakfast included and each day we had something different and it was delicious. We were on the 3rd floor in what was listed as one of the more basic rooms, but the room was lovely. There was a separate large bath and shower, the water pressure was great. The toiletries provided were good (I usually end up buying conditioner but this was good) and housekeeping replaced everything that we used and kept the room looking great throughout the stay. The bed was huge and soooo comfortable, the air conditioning was also good which can be a rare treat in the uk. If I was going to be super picky a big Smart TV would have been nice, but we were out and about a lot. Overall I would highly recommend this hotel and I would definitely return.",5,2022,08,03

Excellent furnishings with efficient concierge, porter, and reception staff.",4,2022,08,02
226,"Great central location, with amazing view and friendly staff",This was a very good stay overall. The staff are very friendly and service staff particularly amazing. The old plumbing in shower would get backed up and service at breakfast was inconsistent but overall a great easy stay. ,5,2022,08,02
226,Average,"Nothing special. Very impersonal. Food good but nothing special. Service in bar poor almost a privilege to be served. It was our wedding anniversary and we got a card and one bun!

226,Fitzwilliam,"Car Parking and valet parking was excellent . Afternoon tea in the lobby was served by a very enthusiastic and helpful guy , check in and check out experience was great . The rest was below standard and dissapointing . We neede the fridge to keep some medication cool . It was not working and despite two attempts to get this fixed it was never attended to and we finishe dup going to the Tesco Express fopr ice. The Dinner was very dissapointing as was breakfast . Ate out the sedcond night. This hotel is way overpriced .",2,2022,07,30
226,Just a beautiful experience.,"Just a very fine hotel, and we've stayed in many locations throughout Europe.  Formal, but with the usual Irish touch.  Those concierges are masterful.

226,Very nice room,"This was one of the few luxuries I had during my trip in Europe this summer and it was well worth it. Each day, room service would bring cookies and water-- little touches that added to the sense of comfort and cosiness. I highly recommend. ",5,2022,07,29

226,Outstanding in every aspect,"We booked a city view room on the 8th floor and just loved looking at the view.

226,"Nothing special, just ok","Had high expectations of this hotel with it being 5 stars for a one night getaway but feel underwhelmed and disappointed with our stay.

Positives: 
Brilliant location for city centre, close to restaurants, bars and shops all within walking distance
Room was quite nice, big comfy bed and nice view of city.
Tea/coffee in room and little chocolates. Bottles of water.

Negatives: 
Check in- I've had better experience in premier inns! nothing 5 star about this or to make you feel special. 
The lobby/bar area have no atmosphere at all, don't think there was any music or anything. So dull and drab.  
There was a constant fan noise in the room even though air con was turned off. Could also hear other guests in the halls.
Light fittings in the room are dusty.
Breakfast- buffet wasn't replenished, granola and yogurt were soggy from sitting out all morning. The hot breakfast was made to order but very obviously not cooked to order as the bacon was tough as old boots and the sausage and black/white pudding/ potato/soda bread dry as anything.  

At ¬£190 per night this just wasn't worth it, I wouldn't recommend this hotel to anyone. I will book a different hotel next time I'm in Belfast.",3,2022,07,19
226,Excellent - 5 Stars,Beautiful hotel with a lovely room. Staff were especially friendly and courteous without it being over the top. Bar was lovely and the breakfast was amazing. Would 100% recommend to anyone visiting Belfast. Wow!!!,5,2022,07,19
226,A wonderfully staffed hotel.,"The hotel is very nicely situated. 
A very pleasant and cosy lobby area.
The best thing about the hotel is the staff, they are so welcoming whether in the restaurant, reception room service or domestic staff, all are charming, helpful and you feel very well looked after.
The room was clean and well appointed to a certain extent but small details like a broken plug socket, light switch etc could have been fixed.
The gym is bare minimum but you have access to a local gym if over 18",5,2022,07,18
226,Nice but not Wow,Overall nice  intimate hotel with friendly staff. Room needed refurb and breakfast room badly understaffed and disorganised although food 100%.  Priced as 5 star room but more like 3 star. Possibly just one of the more worn rooms as last stay was much more impressive.  ,4,2022,07,18

226,Great hotel!,"Had a wonderful stay here. Everything about the hotel was very nice - they do not miss a single detail. I must highlight Phillip, the concierge.

The Ireland coast was stunning with a number of great stops along the way. Phillip walked us through a map of the sights and made several awesome recommendations.

The second one looked no better (I think they just topped up the first one as it came back far too quick)  but I was too embarrassed to send it back again so I drank it. It was either sitting in the line for a week or was poured from a tin. ¬£5.50 for the privilege. I couldn‚Äôt even finish it, it was so bad.

226,Great Night,Finished a day in town with an evening in Fitzwilliam Hotel bar.   Great atmosphere and service.  During the evening three girls sang and played guitars which was easy to listen to and added to the lovely mood in the room.   Our table was managed by Brian who was an absolute star.  He was very efficient in taking our orders and joined in with the banter as the night progressed.  Although the staff appeared extremely busy at no time did we feel rushed.

226,Amazing Andy .....,"My husband and I were very impressed with the fabulous attitude and five star service from Andy at the Front Desk - fortunately our room was ready early ( which is never guaranteed and appreciated when it does happen). We booked our room last minute - and had mentioned it was my husbands birthday - which Andy acknowledged on arrival, making us feel special and valued. Thanks again Andy.

226,Definitely would stay again!,"I have to say, our stay was absolutely exceptional. We were greeted by a smile from Maggie and Yasmine on our arrival to the front desk. We got into a conversation with Maggie about how it was mine and my partners anniversary and out of a good will gesture she upgraded us to a nicer room! We then went to the bar where the cocktails where amazing, good atmosphere and great staff, especially Patrick and Brian! Breakfast was exceptional, with lots of variety. Definitely would stay here again in the future! Thanks for a great experience!

226,"Service , food/ drinks & room were of the highest quality",Every part of our experience at the Fitzwilliam Belfast was great. We enjoyed our food there very much! The sticky toffee desert was my husband‚Äôs favorite. We received chocolates at turndown each night which my son loved. It was centrally located in Belfast.

226,Great service & location,"We had a very nice stay. The service was very friendly and efficient. Excellent breakfast, nice bar. The location is very central & convenient. Only complaint is the lack of furniture in the bathroom - we had to move a side table in from the bedroom to set our toiletry kits down. ",5,2022,06,02
226,Perfect Stay,"A lot of hotels have a lovely reception to show off to customers but when you dig deeper standards drop elsewhere. This was not the case here. I would definitely recommend this hotel. It's easy to moan on reviews, I have, but this hotel is the real deal. 10/10",5,2022,05,31
226,Perfect/Friendly Hotel,"Great location and staff.  The concierge, Philip, is a real gem and set up up with an excellent driver and tour operator.

226,"5 Star luxury, in Belfast and Gluten Free","A wonderful luxury stay at this wonderful hotel in the heart of Belfast. 
Situated a leisurely 10 minute stroll from the heart of the city, meant we could get around easily to all the sights and pubs that the city has to offer. 
As a Coeliac, I often struggle with breakfast, however the menu was so extensive and with many GF options available. 
They even provided GF sandwiches for a day trip as I'd struggled to get any locally.
My wife and I will always remember the friendliness of the staff and luxurious bedrooms.

226,Stunning Hotel in the friendly City of Belfast,"We travelled to Belfast to see the Queen-Adam Lambert Concert at the SSE and it was absolutely fantastic, Staying at the Fitzwilliam was the icing on the cake.. Our room was bright,with lovely decor, and he walk in shower was a delight. We were only in Belfast for 3 days so could not sample all the Breakfast choices, just delicious, all the staff made you feel special.. each night we had the bed turned down with 2 chocs each left for us..a treat indeed. We did not know the Orange centenary Parade was happening on our second day so we got to experience that too. Every person we spoke to was so friendly....We are thinking of going to the Balmoral Show next year and this Hotel is must if we do!! Well done to the Fitzwilliam!",5,2022,05,30
226,Lovely hotel in central Belfast,The Fitzwilliam is a very comfortable and stylish 5 * hotel. The room size was perfect and the large bathroom with both a shower and bath facility was of the highest standard and cleanliness. The hotel is in easy walking distance of most of the places of interest in Belfast and also to many bars and restaurants. The reception and concierge staff we all extremely friendly and helpful. We would definitely recommend this hotel to anyone who is planning to stay in Belfast.,5,2022,05,29

Excellent breakfast, though speed service on one day could have been a little quicker.
Well appointed room (executive).
Helpful concierge.",5,2022,05,26

The room was very clean and a good selection of teas, coffees (real coffee and cafetiere were provided). Also decaff was provided which was a bonus. The bed was really comfortable and we slept very well. All staff were really friendly and helpful and the lobby was very cosy and inviting with lots of books, etc to browse through. We would return there whenever we visit Belfast again.",5,2022,05,25
226,Definitely not 5 star,"Extremely Disappointed,  An expensive night away only to be awake most of it.
The traffic sound from outside was very noisy.  The room was also very disappointing. As a 5 star youd expect to be blown away... Marks on the wall, carpet stains, blind stain. Creeky bed,  ceiling stain,  headboard stains,  as someone with OCD this was very disturbing.. Email the hotel, no response, so won't be back or recommend to anyone. ",3,2022,05,24
226,Personalized service,"The staff is fantastic! Helped arrange a car & driver, answered all our questions prior to even getting there. Gavin was great very informative and helpful. 
Separate note might want to incorporate that the Game of Thrones cast/crew stayed there.",5,2022,05,23
226,Good stay in Belfast,"Gavin the concierge made our trip to Belfast. He arranged a black taxi tour, gave dinner recommendations and made reservations, helped us find a cash machine, got our car situated and generally made us feel welcome. Our room was nice and also quiet.  I was glad we booked the breakfast in advance as it was both ample and delicious and the perfect way to start the day and get on track while managing a 5 hour time difference. The valet parking was worth it too as they took care of the car and made it simple to get in and out of town.   Good overall stay.",4,2022,05,22
226,Lovely stay,"Stayed here for just one night as wife visiting family elsewhere in Ireland so decided to spend a little time in belfast . Lovely hotel , quality without being pretentious.

On our second night we stayed in the hotel for dinner and drinks and didn‚Äôt leave that‚Äôs how much we enjoyed it! The breakfast is unreal, everything fresh and lots of it.. 

We will be staying here again and recommending to all friends and family who want a trip to Belfast. 

If you want a guaranteed 5 star service and experience you need to visit The Fitzwilliam hotel Belfast. It has raised the bar for anywhere we will stay in future.",5,2022,05,20
226,"Great hotel, very friendly staff","The Fitzwilliam is an excellent hotel, all staff are friendly and helpful. It‚Äôs location is within easy access of the train station, and a short walk to the city centre. Would thoroughly recommend it for a short city break. ",5,2022,05,20
226,Great hotel,"This was the second time we stayed in this hotel, another great experience all round. Very friendly staff - unobtrusive but available when required, efficient service, terrific bathroom, excellent quality breakfast. ",5,2022,05,19
226,Outstanding Hotel in the heart of Belfast,"This hotel is luxurious with the service to match. The staff are all extremely friendly and helpful. The breakfast is plentiful and the room lovely, with a huge double bed.  Within 10 minutes you are in the city centre but its a perfect location for exploring the city. The concierge and in particular Phil was extremely helpful in helping us identify key attractions and ensuring we were informed to have a great weekend. ",5,2022,05,17
226,Leisure,"The hotel was standard. Rooms were nice. Most staff were friendly, service slow at times. Make sure the alarm on the clock in your room is not set before you go to bed, ours went off at 7am waking us up!!!",4,2022,05,16
226,Stay away,Over all it was a brilliant stay! Loved the hotel and the staff couldn‚Äôt have done enough for us! Will definitely be staying again! The rooms were beautiful and easy for me to get around in my wheelchair. It was all very accessible.,5,2022,05,15

226,Unaccountable,"Car damaged while parked there-found when drove away. Deputy manager notes Cian,GM said in a meeting ‚Äúwe will not take liability‚Äù Someone zip tied our hubcap. Called them 30 min after check out when found damage. They found no evidence. Was the only time car out of our sight. Would NEVER recommend.",1,2022,05,12
226,Our stay,We had a brilliant experience and stay at the fitzwilliam by far. The staff where more than helpful throughout our stay. The food and service was excellent. We couldn‚Äôt fault it at all. We will definitely be back and stay again üòÄ,5,2022,05,12
226,Sofa bed stay,"Booked this overnight stay as part of a Mother‚Äôs Day gift for my mum. Originally I had booked a room for 2 people, however later changed the booking to 3 people so my sister could join us. 
I was extremely disappointed to have been charged almost twice the price of the original double room rate to expect one of us to sleep on the pull out sofa bed - Definitely not what I expected from a 5* hotel. I have stayed at 4* hotels in the past and all family rooms have had at least one actual bed per person with much bigger rooms. Similar 5* hotels in the area offer at least a double and single bed for family rooms and also at better value.  Basically seems like I was charged twice the price of what a double room would cost, all for pulling out the sofa bed and putting a sheet on it. Had I of been informed that one person would have been required to stay on a sofa bed I would have paid the extra ¬£30 to simply book a second room. 
The pull out bed was not at all comfortable and would not recommend.",2,2022,05,11
226,"Central, Clean, Pleasant","We arrived on a wet day to a warm welcome. 
No doormen as per the photo though :)
Anyway, good check in, straight up to room. Lighting minimal and with no art or furniture in hallways it all felt gloomy.
Room spacious, bed was a futon-style and not that comfy but room was well appointed and very clean. Good bathroom and top shower. 
The gym shouldn't be called a ‚ÄòFitness Suite‚Äô though. Its about 4 metres by 3.5 metres in size and was abysmal. The first time I visited there was a man there and I felt I was invading his space. I left. Minimal equipment in a depressing space :( 
Well situated and an easy walk to shops, restaurants etc. 
Easy and very helpful check out. Great staff.
Would we stay here again?
Probably a ‚Äòno‚Äô. Not because of the staff though but more so as this is really only a 4 Star in our view. 
Wish you well though :)",3,2022,05,11
226,Fab Placed in the heart of Belfast,"Very nice hotel with friendly bar staff and well appointed rooms. We enjoyed the quality of the bedroom and had a king size bed, which was a bonus. Bathrooms were pristine and there was the added benefit of a walk-in shower.",5,2022,05,11
226,Like sleeping in a vault (thats a good thing),"There are 4 important things for a hotel for me, cleanliness, quiet sleeping environment, comfortable bed/pillows, good shower.  The Fitzwillams exceeds expectations on all these points.  The room was so quiet it was like sleeping in a vault.  Bed was very comfortable and the shower was big and had great water pressure and termperature.  The location is also really convenient for central Belfast and the staff is very helpful and friendly.  Overall a very good stay and I would recommend. ",5,2022,05,11
226,Fabulous weekend getaway,"Great trip to Belfast, made even more memorable by an  excellent stay at the Fitzwilliam Hotel. The hotel was stunning and live music in the bar started our trip off well. Great location and impeccable customer service, I would definitely stay again.",5,2022,05,09
226,Excellent team of Concierges.,"Phillip, Gerard and Gavin were the 3 concierges that we had the most interaction with. They were absolutely fantastic! We would stay here again simply because of those 3. They really went above and beyond the call of duty to make sure we enjoyed our stay in Belfast. There is nothing about this city that they don't know and they can arrange the best tours and tour operators, drivers, restaurants, itinerary suggestions, etc. The hotel itself is perfectly situated. The rooms are comfortable; the staff was great; and the restaurant and bar are very good. If I had to make one suggestion for management (other than to give the concierges a raise) it would be to invest in some soft, top quality down pillows). Their feather pillows, which you can request, are no better than their standard ones, which are not in line with the quality of this hotel.",5,2022,05,08
226,A city gem,This was our first time staying at the Fitzwilliam Hotel and we were not disappointed. It‚Äôs a beautiful hotel with stunning rooms. Super location in the heart of the city. We will certainly be returning!,5,2022,05,08
226,Best place to stay at in Belfast,"Excellent hotel, perfect location, extremely helpful and attentive staff, perfect in every sense.  Would throughly recommend staying here as we totally enjoyed our time at the hotel.  Easy walking distance to all locations of interest as well as city restaurants and pubs.  ",5,2022,05,07
226,Disappointed,"Not sure why this is rated a 5 star. Room was very poorly designed, furniture was uncomfortable, and access to electircal outlets very difficult, required furniture to be moved. Having said that, staff were helpful and friendly, public areas were nice, and food was good.",3,2022,05,07
226,Highly recommended,"There is nothing I could mark down on rating this hotel. Excellent venue, excellent room and food. Everything was excellent about this hotel.  Staff went over and above to ensure an enjoyable stay. Thank you ",5,2022,05,07

226,Poor service understaffed and bar too small .,"No room on bar for a drink after our meal , told to sit in lobby and somebody will take our order . 20min later nobody had come .. we left . Every single table in the lobby had dirty glasses on them from when we went up for our meal at 730 till we came back down and went to bed before 10.. all dirty glasses still there .. def not 5 star service or hotel . No hot water for bath either . Staff were friendly but under serious pressure . Understaffed . Breakfast was lovely but again had to wait 20min to be served and then asked for a cappuccino which they forgot and had to ask again . It was fine if you got on a cheap deal . Wouldn‚Äôt bother going again . ",3,2022,05,03

226,Loved the Fitzwilliam,We traveled to Belfast for the World Irish Dancing Championships.  The Fitzwilliam was a very convenient location for our needs.  The accommodation was lovely and the food was excellent.  I'd definitely recommend the Fitzwilliam for travelers to Belfast.,5,2022,05,01
226,Luxury done well,"Hotel staff were the friendliest I‚Äôve ever met, nothing was too much bother. Room was comfy and opulent, turn down service was special and thoughtful. Bath, shower and provided toiletries were unique!",5,2022,05,01
226,Going very well until the final morning,"A lovely hotel in Belfast ‚Ä¶ staff excellent at reception and we got access to our bedroom in the morning. I could not fault the room ‚Ä¶ a  five star standard room. 
So far so good until we went for breakfast the following morning.
No real problem queuing to get in for 10 minutes but on hindsight this should have alerted me to the fact problems lay ahead in the restaurant. In summary, it was organised chaos - there appears to be no one in charge overseeing things.
We waited a while for our pot of tea to arrive, I then politely asked could we order some breakfast (it was very clear the surly waiter didn‚Äôt like me asking and abruptly threw on to the buffet counter a bowl he was carrying). Some of the food eventually arrived but really poorly cooked e.g. the poached eggs were like hard boiled eggs, black pudding brick hard, toast never arrived etc).
Further, the buffet was missing lots of key items .. as I say no one in charge managing and ensuring food levels were right. 
The final straw was at checkout when concierge couldn‚Äôt find our taxi booking that we booked with them the day before!
As I say lovely hotel but management lacking and not visible to oversee and address the operational issues.",2,2022,05,01
226,Fabulous hotel,"We had a fantastic stay at the Fitzwilliam hotel. Great location in the city centre. The staff were all very friendly and helpful. The rooms were lovely, clean and lots of little extras which was lovely ",5,2022,04,30
226,Disappointing Service,I stayed at the hotel as part of a birthday treat and accidently left a pair of shoes behind.  I contacted the hotel and was told someone would get back to me after looking in to it.  I had to contact the hotel for the next 3 days to be told the same thing.  Finally I was informed that I didn't leave any shoes behind because nothing was found.  There was nothing else they could/would do.  That was the end of it.  Not the type of service I would expect from a 5 star hotel.  Very disappointed and shoeless!,2,2022,04,28
226,Great attention to detail,"Stayed here for a night and because it was midweek and a little quieter, we were upgraded to a deluxe junior suite at no extra cost!
The staff were so friendly and helpful (reception, concierge, bar staff, etc.) and nothing was too much trouble. 
Our room was clean and spacious, with lots of nice touches and attention to detail. Once we came back to our room at night, we‚Äôd chocolates left on our pillows, our bed was turned down, and extra water was left for us. 
The hotel‚Äôs location was right in the heart of the city, with bars, restaurants and shops all within walking distance. 
Delighted with this hotel and we‚Äôll be back next time we‚Äôre up to Belfast!",5,2022,04,27
226,Fantastic location and room,"We had a wonderful stay here for four nights in April. The location is perfect for walking into the city centre and for getting to local bus transit, the airport bus and train lines. The room was beautiful, and service was excellent.",5,2022,04,26
226,Excellent,"We stayed in this hotel to attend and event. We wish we could have stayed longer it was just incredible. The service is 10/10, staff are just so so helpful. We would highly recommend. Great location also. ",5,2022,04,26
226,"Great food, superb service","We enjoyed lunch today in the Fitzwilliam. Had bar food, loved the cosiness of the bar, we were able to chat about our week end in Belfast for a conference. We had service from James ( you know who  you are James!!!) and it was exemplary. He was the first waiter who has introduced himself to the group before distributing menus to us. He told us that he would be a couple of minutes placing menus on the tables and that he would then take our order. He is a superb communicator and a great advertisement for the hotel. Our food was really tasty and delivered efficiently and speedily. Despite his best efforts none of us succumbed to the dessert menu, and boy did he sell the delights on offer!!! We all then ordered a variety of coffees and he delivered a terrific cup to each of us. He warmed each cup with boiling water for a couple of minutes before filling each order. Attention to detail like this is rare, so take a bow James. 
I had occasion to visit the hotel early on Saturday morning and asked for some advice from the concierge; they were very helpful and informative, as well as being
friendly and chatty.
I highly recommend a visit to the Fitzwilliam for a meal and/or a drink. You will not be disappointed.
 It was very evident that the staff are well chosen and trained and are given the freedom to interact with guests in a way which I would like to see in other restaurants and hotels.",5,2022,04,24
226,Fitzwilliam hotel,Fitzwilliam hotel excellent place To stay very clean good service  The staff are very well trained and a good breakfast  and ideal location which is very close  to theater. restaurants  and town center.

One of my favourite hotels and looking forward to staying there again.   Just a few minutes walk from  City Hall.,5,2022,04,23
226,No restaurant,"Hotel very convenient to Belfast city centre , outside seating on very busy main road in the shade, booked pre theatre dinner but on arrival restaurant was closed bar food only. The breakfast was fantastic the next morning,staff very friendly and helpful, room could have been cleaner ,glad ring marks on table surface sweet wrappers on floor from previous occupation",4,2022,04,22
226,An enjoyable stay,"This was our first visit to Belfast, so we had never been to the hotel before. We arrived there early from our flight and found that our room was ready at 11.00am, which was great as we thought that we would only be able to drop our bags off before going off to explore.
The hotel is in a good central location, the staff are very welcoming and friendly, the room was lovely, and the bed was extremely comfortable. We liked the turndown service of an evening with complementary chocolates, which was a pleasant surprise.
After going out for our evening meals we would come back and go in the bar where we would have a cocktail (these were particularly good) and my partner would have wine or a beer.
I have marked this one down for the breakfast which was poor ‚Äì lacking choice in the buffet and two things that we had I would have thrown away if I were at home. Maybe they just had an off day, but  we went out for breakfast for the rest of our stay.
Overall, we did have an enjoyable stay here during our city break.",4,2022,04,20
226,Nice hotel with fantastic front of house staff,"My friend and I stayed at The Fitzwilliam hotel whilst in Belfast celebrating my Birthday. 

We arrived very early and were not expecting our room to be ready, however Catalina prompted housekeeping and whilst we got a pot of tea, the room was made available. 
We were also upgraded to help celebrate my birthday.
The room was lovely with a dual aspect window. 

After a day sightseeing we returned to find a small birthday cake in the room, a nice touch. 

Whilst we did not eat in the hotel, we did have cocktails which were very nice. 

Overall a great hotel with staff who understand the value of customer service.",5,2022,04,20

226,My stay,"This hotel was absolutely gorgeous, the staff are very friendly and the rooms are beautiful.
 Me and my girlfriend visited the bar twice and both times were treated by Jason. Jason is an absolute credit to this business he is the main reason I would return or recommend this hotel. He made us feel so at home and his service was  5 star.

The breakfast was awful. The continental breakfast was okay but the hot food was disgusting. The first day my pudding came out so undercooked I couldn‚Äôt even eat it, the mushroom was like eating a wet shoe disgusting. We though that this might be a once off so we went down the next morning earlier hoping to have a better shot, she ordered the omelet, not the worst just a bit tasteless but was eatable. I got the pancakes, when I say you could use them as a hockey puc I mean it. They were rock hard, I was able to bag them off the table and they made a hollow sound. I would never recommend someone to pay extra to get this breakfast. It‚Äôs the only thing in this hotel that makes it not 5 star it is at best a 1 star breakfast ",4,2022,04,14
226,Bar staff,"JASON!!! 
Jason was an absolute pleasure to deal with. He made us feel so welcome, he is a credit to this company. This hotel was absolutely beautiful but the sole reason I would come back is to be served by him. His knowledge or the menu , wines and cocktails is outstanding.

226,Lovely 4 night stay,"We booked via a BA flight and hotel package and chose this hotel because of it‚Äôs central city location. We were glad we did for sightseeing and even more so because of what a lovely hotel. On arrival a warm welcome and although our room wasn‚Äôt ready we only had a few minutes wait we received a complimentary cocktail. Nice touch. The room was well equipped. Very comfortable in all aspects. Loved the cafeti√®re coffee supply. Very comfortable bed. The housekeepers did a lovely job during the day and evening turn down. All the staff were so friendly and particularly the lovely man who greeted us in the bar. Unfortunately did not get his name but he treated us like long lost friends each time and made our visits special. 
We ate out as the hotel is so close to restaurants for breakfast and evening meals. But we did have one meal in the bar and the food here was excellent and reasonably priced. So all in all a very pleasant stay. Checking out was a breeze too. Would recommend and love to return.",5,2022,04,09
226,Excellent Stay,"Great hotel with really helpful staff, would recommend staying here. Location is good too if you don‚Äôt mind a short walk to the City Centre.

226,"Memorable visit to The Fitzwilliam Hotel, Belfast.","Excellent friendly service. Delicious food (4 adults had bed, breakfast and dinner). Our car was parked for us on arrival and returned with our suitcases in the boot when we were leaving. Really comfortable beds with bed linen and towels of the highest quality. The location is fantastic as it‚Äôs a very short walk to the City Centre. The Concierge was very willing and able to answer any questions we had, organised a taxi to the Titanic Exhibition and sorted out a problem with a Black Taxi Tour which we had booked before coming to Belfast. I have absolutely no problem recommending the Fitzwilliam Hotel where you will be looked after by a wonderful staff and have a memorable stay.",5,2022,04,03
226,Short break,"The room was excellent and the staff were lovely. A special mention for Brian in the Lobby Bar an excellent and very attentive staff member. The hotel is very close to all amenities.

We will be back the next time we get a free minute.

",5,2022,03,29
226,Compares poorly with Fitzwilliam in Dublin,"It's Ok, but not 5 star. Friendliness of staff is exemplary and very welcoming., but lacks little 5 star touches eg no welcome glass of sparkling wine on arrival as you get in dublin Fitzwilliam. Breakfasts poorer too re choice and quality. Room very clean but lacking in basic power/charge points for mobiles and laptops",3,2022,03,26
226,Great hotel and excellent staff,"The hotel is perfectly situated in the centre of Belfast. The decor and facilities are great, as is attention to detail.  The staff are excellent and go above and beyond.  Food is fabulous - both in the bar and restaurant.",5,2022,03,24
226,A brilliant stay in the heart of Belfast,Great service and a fantastic location for exploring Belfast. Very comfortable beds. The hotel bar is great. The breakfast is very generous. But the best thing about the hotel is the friendliness and efficiency of the staff. ,5,2022,03,22

Concierge knowledgeable and able to judge our needs astutely  ",5,2022,03,21
226,Lovely Stay right I  the heart of Belfast,One of the few places we have stayed recently where staff are on their game. Friendly and efficient you don't have to try to find them they find you and seem to know what you need. Available without being intrusive. We used the bar and the restaurant and found both great good food and super cocktails. Particular shout out to the bar staff. It was a pleasure to stay here. Nice big room spotless. Loved the extra big bathroom. Great location in the heart of the city and right by the opera house.,5,2022,03,21
226,Very good but not excellent,Arrival was surprising as there was no bell staff which is unusual for a 5* hotel and the restaurant was closed at 9pm on a Friday night.  Nice public areas and friendly staff throughout.  Rooms were clean and tidy.  I personally found the bed too firm and the bedding didn‚Äôt live up to a top class hotel.  Pretty low flow out of shower head if that matters to you.  Candle in the bathroom was a nice touch.   ,4,2022,03,21
226,Excellent service & location,"Thoroughly enjoyed our stay. Excellent service, location and room. Very friendly staff throughout the hotel. Loved the extra touches in our room - water, drinks, slippers etc. Great parking facilities too. ",5,2022,03,19
226,Need to get a plan in place,"Room small.  Bathroom was very tight if a smaller sink was put in the toilet could then be moved away from the bath making things a little more comfy.
There was no tea or instant coffee so we chased a housekeeper to get some but only had tea. Espresso machine is room but much too strong.  No biscuits which I thought would be there and those terrible milk pods which for a 5* hotel is a real no-no. There is a fridge in the room so it should be fresh.",4,2022,03,18
226,Fantastic city break,"Amazing hotel, made to feel very welcome from the start. The room was gorgeous and had everything you could want! Turndown service was a lovely surprise we weren't expecting with bottled water (eco friendly) left beside the bed and robes and slippers set out. The bar was so nice, I don't drink but my husband said they do a decent beer. The breakfast was outstanding, from being seated next to a huge selection of continental options, and I mean, think of something continental, it was there and all looked incredible. Banana bread, mini pan au chocolat, yummy! Cooked breakfast was amazing and the staff are so friendly and attentive, nothing was too much trouble.You can tell they take really pride in their work and want you to enjoy the entire experience. 
We can't wait to go back for another treat night getaway.",5,2022,03,18
226,Theft,"I have stayed at the Fitzwilliam on several occasions and have never had an issue - however the latest stay raises cause for concern - a watch was inadvertently left on the bathroom shelf on check out, when calling the next day- I was assured I would receive a call back that day - which I did not, on calling again two days later, I did get speaking to the manager - in summary the watch cannot be found, sorry about that! It raises huge concerns - as I advised the manager - one of three options (i) the staff were negligent and threw the item in the bin, (ii) their cleaning schedule was remiss, they failed to notice it and the subsequent guests took the item, or (iii) they have a dishonest member of staff. Either way I am unimpressed and have no confidence staying at the Fitzwilliam again - and I want to highlight the issue as I think it is hugely important and the response of the hotel unsatisfactory.",2,2022,03,17
226,Great Hotel,Superb hotel in great location with attentive staff and beautifully appointed bedroom exceptional value for a five star hotel right next to the opera house and close to all amenities will be staying again!,5,2022,03,17

226,Favorite Belfast Hotel,"I adore this hotel. I have stayed there twice and I plan on staying there every time I am in Belfast. I have dreams about the hotel. Their rooms are comfortable, their tubs are amazing, the furnishings are beautiful and their staff is extremely helpful and friendly. GREAT food. It just feels like a second home. I love coming back there after a day of adventures in Belfast. They are quite reasonably priced too, for a luxury hotel. Would recommend to anyone.",5,2022,03,09
226,Perfect Belfast Stay,"Fabulous hotel...fabulous staff.  A perfect place from which to enjoy Belfast.  The staff make an already great hotel, excellent.  We have fallen in love with Northern Ireland.  Some of the friendliest people anywhere, and the Fitzwilliam perfectly represents the best of that hospitality.",5,2022,03,09
226,No way to contact this hotel,I'm simply trying to contact the hotel. They gave no direct email address. The contact form on  their website doesn't work and their phone keeps ringing out. I need to enquire why a booking of mine has been cancelled with no reason given.,3,2022,03,08
226,Superb hotel,Superb hotel. Extremely clean and staff were always so friendly. Rooms were very stylish and nice classical music playing in our room upon arrival. Food was delicious - both dinner & breakfast. Good location within walking distance of everything in the city centre ,5,2022,03,08

226,Amazing birthday getaway,"My partner and I really enjoyed our stay in Fitzwilliam. The room was spacious, clean and beautiful. The bathroom was exceptionally clean, with several towels and a bath mat provided (as the floor in the shower was slippery which is probably the only thing I didn't like). Overall, daily cleaning services were provided and it was extremely nice to come back to a clean, fresh room after exploring the city during the day
The staff were incredibly positive, helpful and polite - that was so nice, considering it was my first trip after a long break because of covid restrictions everywhere. It was my birthday, so the hotel staff placed a cute birthday plate with a piece of cake on the desk in our room - such a nice little touch!

I highly recommend this hotel to all visitors of Belfast. I'll be back!",5,2022,03,04
226,A taste of luxury,"We went for a 3 day break to celebrate my Husband's birthday.  Our room was on the 7th floor, very quiet and had a great view across the city to the surrounding hills. We were greeted by very friendly staff then zoomed up to our room by the extremely speedy elevator (never known such an efficient lift before!) Our room was gorgeous with a huge king sized bed, which was turned down for us each evening with a small box of chocolates left on each pillow.  The complimentary beverages were to a high standard, including a pouch of ground coffee and a cafeti√®re in which to make 'real' coffee - very nice touch.  On the last day (12 noon check out time) we were able to leave our case with the concierge and collect when it was time to leave for the airport.  All in all, a lovely smooth relaxing stay in this comfortable and classy hotel.  The only thing we were a little disappointed in was the restaurant menu.  It only had a small amount of choice of which we couldn't find anything we fancied, so didn't bother eating there. As a 5-star Hotel, I'd have thought they would have had a more comprehensive menu. This wasn't a problem however, as there are plenty of bars and restaurants in close walking distance.  ",4,2022,03,04
226,"Outstanding hotel and service, Five stars!",Fantastic service from all of the staff at The Fitzwilliam. The whole customer experience was flawless and I've rarely come across better service in any hotel I've stayed at across the world. Your staff are all a credit to your brand and are invested in ensuring the customer has an five star experience. This was from the receptionist to the concierge to room service to house keeping - All of whom were a pleasure to interact with. We got the feeling that nothing was too much trouble and that's exceptionally hard to achieve in hospitality across that range of staff!  Thank you for an outstanding experience. We will of course be back to visit The Fitzwilliam again. ,5,2022,03,02
226,Lovely stay,"Had the best stay. Lovely staff, they couldn‚Äôt do enough for us. Great breakfast and fantastic drinks in the bar area. Loved the decor in the rooms and the bathroom was fantastic. Can‚Äôt wait to be back x",5,2022,03,01
226,"Would stay again, lovely rooms","Lovely rooms with high standard amenities, good location and clean. Criticisms would be limited room service menu, fixed ¬£10 tray charge to deliver the room service, check-out did not mention my refund of the ¬£50 tab. ",4,2022,03,01
226,"Clean, Spacious and Ideal Location","Stayed here for a weekend break and didn‚Äôt disappoint. The room was immaculate and very spacious, With the additional of complementary additions.

The only downside was that the breakfast wasn‚Äôt the best, the buffet selection of cereal, bread, fruits and treats  where great. It was just the main breakfast didn‚Äôt meet the standard that I was expecting.

Overall the stay was great and will be returns when in Belfast agin.",5,2022,02,27
226,Not great,"This experience was fine but was most certainly not to a five star standard. 
On arrival we were greeted by friendly staff.  The interior in the narrow corridor is very dark and the area around the lift had litter lying on the floor from our arrival to our departure two days later.  
The window handle in our room was broken which meant that there was a constant draft and noise from the street throughout the night. Our room was not cleaned despite leaving the sign outside our door.  We rang reception and they did send housekeeping up with fresh towels. Looking back on other reviews we can see that this appears to be a reoccurring problem with this hotel. 
The restaurant was very disappointing. A nice setting but we certainly wouldn‚Äôt recommend dining in this hotel as it is not worth the extortionate prices that they charge. The selection on the menu is poor and the portion sizes are very small. Side orders are essential if you want to have any food on your plate. We were also very disappointed to be charged  ¬£6.50 for a large bottle of still water, that was no bigger than one litre. There was a slightly better selection for breakfast however. 
We would not recommend this hotel. ",2,2022,02,23
226,Best hotel in Belfast,"Friendliest staff, best appointed rooms, and an exceptionally convenient location. Highly recommend for business or pleasure. The hotel itself really represents the best of Belfast. We‚Äôve spent as few as a couple of nights and as long as a couple of weeks and the experience has never waned. ",5,2022,02,23
226,Brilliant birthday weekend trip,"This is a beautiful hotel, in a great location.
We had a King Executive room which was a great size with a lovely bathroom. We asked for a high room which was accommodated. We could hear a tiny bit of traffic noise but nothing that could disturb us. 
There are lots of nice touches in the room - robes, slippers, an umberella, quality toiletries, even a tea light and matches for a candle lit bath.
A turndown service with pillow chocolates was a nice touch, as was the birthday cake left for me.
Staff are particularly friendly. Concierge gave us great tips. Special shout out for Nigel and Declan who were so kind and generous with their knowledge.
We had a lovely stay in a lovely city. Thank you.",5,2022,02,21
226,ideal,"perfect location, excellent service ., well appointed ,wonderful breakfast! i would recommend this hotel as a perfect base to explore the fascinating city of belfast , we would definitely stay here again ",5,2022,02,21
226,Excellence on all standards,We stayed for our 30th wedding anniversary as a treat from our daughter it was just fabulous from start to finish. So central for out and about. The staff were all so helpful and went way out to make our stay so pleasant and lovely . ,5,2022,02,20
226,Nice hotel - good sized rooms - clean,"Stayed in a king room, good size and kitted out with all the essentials. Bathroom nice with a large shower and bath. Bar is nice - service a bit OTT maybe. Breakfast in the restaurant was good. Overall the hotel felt a little on the cold side, especially for breakfast in the restaurant. It was exceptionally cold outside when we stayed though. Would stay again. ",4,2022,02,20
226,Messed up our booking,"After receiving vouchers for crafternoon tea the 4 of us arranged a slot for Saturday afternoon. Paid for baby sitters, travelled by train and looking forward to some nice food and craft bear. However no such luck, was told our booking which was taken over the phone was actually marked down as afternoon tea, not the crafternoon we had expected. Staff just told us you can either have afternoon tea or leave and re-book. 
So after having spent ¬£100 on baby sitters and trains we basically had to go and find somewhere else to eat on valentines weekend. The Fitzwilliam offered nothing, not even an option to have a drink at the bar or arrange for us to stay for food elsewhere in the hotel.
We ended up having drinks in the europa and managed to sneak into the red panda for a quick bite before heading home again.
Totally wasted night and the Fitzwilliam didn't care.",1,2022,02,19
226,Best of Belfast,24 hour flying visit to Belfast.  The hotel is perfect location. Staff friendly and helpful and rooms extremely comfortable.  We had to change our plans at last minute and the hotel was extremely understanding and accommodating.,5,2022,02,18

The quality of the breakfast was amazing. 
Great choice.

226,Excellent service with a concierge team that cannot do enough to make your stay enjoyable,"We had a lovely stay at the Fitzwilliam in Belfast. The location is excellent, Restaurant amazing and reception and concierge team extremely friendly . The concierge could not do enough to make our stay comfortable and we‚Äôre helpful both before and after our visit. The room was very comfortable although defiantly ask for extra pillows. Our air conditioning didn‚Äôt work and there were some issues/confusion that led to awkwardness with housekeeping but all housekeepers were very friendly and brought chocolates before bed‚Ä¶a lovely touch. ",4,2022,02,17
226,Wonderful Valentines Experience,Truly a 5* experience. All the staff were very friendly and could not do enough to ensure that my partner and I had the best experience possible. The food was lovely and the cocktails were even better,5,2022,02,15

226,Wonderful Night ,"Myself and my partner stayed in the hotel Friday night and it was absolutely wonderful. I would 100% recommend staying, the concierge greets you upon arrival, the receptionist was lovely he was very efficient, friendly and explained about breakfast etc also the residents bar. Our room was lovely, we stayed in an executive room and it was so nice, the bed was very comfy, the couch, the decor the bathroom everything was very nicely designed. The extra touches were really nice! a stereo in the room, of course the stocked mini bar you can ring reception to unlock, earplugs, mints, playing cards, magazines to browse, candle with matches by the bath, a cafetiere and Java Republic coffee, an umbrella to use during your stay, all things I hadn't seen in other 5 stars and then all the usual nice things, shower gels, shampoo, conditioner, robes, slippers, a safe etc. Turn down service with complementary chocolates and water beside your bed (see photo).

All the staff were really lovely I would 100% stay again and recommend the hotel to others.",5,2022,02,13
226,Wonderful experience,My wife and I stayed in this well located hotel for one night. I pre booked the valet car parking which was well priced at ¬£25 per night. On arrival I parked on the lay-by at the hotel and my wife and I made our way to the reception while the concierge parked our car. The receptionist  was very pleasant and helpful.  We had arrived 2 hours prior to normal check-in time and were pleasantly surprised that our room was available. The rooms are very spacious and spotlessly clean with everything that yo would need. We didn't eat in the restaurant but had a few drinks in the bar where the staff are all very pleasant and attentive and while we were there they brought everyone some snacks. On checking out the receptionist arranged with the concierge to take our luggage and put it in our car while we went down town to do some last minute shopping. We arrived back at the hotel a couple of hours later and had a coffee in the lobby. The concierge went and parked our car at the side of the hotel for our departure. All in all we had a wonderful experience and my only regret was that we didn't stay far another night. All the staff go above and beyond.,5,2022,02,13
226,A wonderful visit to Belfast,"From start to finish the stay was lovely, nothing was too much trouble, great easy check in, lovely Exec room that had so many lovely unexpected extra little touches. The concierge are amazing they go out of their way to help you out and take the time to find out your needs, smart and elegant bar area where the staff are very knowledgeable and the wee nibbles are a nice touch, great location for everything central and within easy walking distance of all attractions, for those with not so good mobility the concierge can sort out transport that suits you. My only grumble would be the breakfast suited man who was a little abrupt and was forever taking his mask off, a little unnerving whilst he is serving. Overall a fantastic 5* stay and would recommend to anyone.",5,2022,02,12
226,Good central hotel with excellent Breakfast Buffet,"Great hotel for staying in central Belfast, doormen and floor staff very helpful and welcoming. Bedroom very comfortable though the decor was quite dark with little natural daylight, was also very cool, would recommend asking about heating controls. ",4,2022,02,12

226,Ok,"It was ok. The staff were friendly on arrival and departure, the restaurant memeber that met and the other member who served us seemed very unsure on any dietary questions we asked one seeming to be a manger. My breakfast was included for both of us @ ¬£15 wasn‚Äôt worth it for all I ended up getting after the hotel being informed days before arrival.",4,2022,02,08

226,Great location and wonderful staff,"We visited Belfast to celebrate an important birthday, and what a great place to do it.

The Fitzwilliam is very central, just a short walk to Robinsons bar which is good for food and a drink. If the weather is ok then the Cathedral Quarter is not too far to walk to also.

The Fitzwilliam bar is a nice location, but quiet. There was live music on the Friday night which was very entertaining, but not well attended. The staff are wonderful and so friendly and helpful. Breakfast is substantial and well worth it to set yourself up for the day.

Definitely visit again in the future.",5,2022,01,31

Bed was super comfy and the concierge service was second to none. The decor was so nice and even the smallest details were all well thought off.",5,2022,01,26
226,Fantastic Stay in great hotel,"Stayed in this fantastic hotel for two nights - it's great reputation is well deserved!  The room was spotlessly clean, light airy and well designed.  Many thoughtful touches such as dressing robe and quality toiletries etc. were included in the room, as well as great quality cafeti√®re coffee!

The bathroom was a great size and tastefully decorated.  All in all a lovely place to be.

Standout feature of the stay was the Fitzwilliam breakfast.  Massive assortment of Continental, Scandinavian, traditional buffet - and cooked to order dishes available,  The quality of the food was outstanding, and matched by the great service.

Location is great for getting to all areas of Belfast City Centre

I look forward to returning to the Fitzwilliam!",5,2022,01,24

226,EXTORTIONATE ROOM SERVICE CHARGE,"Beautiful hotel, super luxurious. The front desk staff are second to none; anything and everything gets fixed immediately. 
I stayed here with my husband for work for 10 days. The staff are super friendly. The food is good in the restaurant. The breakfast menu is extensive and truly amazing, great choice and quality.
My only gripe is the ¬£10 tray charge in top of any room service you order, be it a sandwich or a full blown meal. We have travelled all over the world and stayed in the most luxurious of places, so it‚Äôs a hard one to stomach. It‚Äôs such a shame‚Ä¶.",4,2022,01,12
226,Great weekend!,We all had a great weekend  at the Fitzwilliam as we were there for a special birthday. Staff were so pleasant and helpful which I found very welcoming. Great location within walking distance to everything,5,2022,01,12

226,Highly recommended,"This hotel is lovely, from its welcoming friendly very informative staff to its beautiful comfortable rooms with elegant bathrooms with candles for extra relaxation. The hotel is very easy to get to simply jump on the 300 bus at the airport and go to the main bus terminal which is just around the corner from the hotel. I highly recommend this hotel and Belfast for a lovely short break ",5,2022,01,08
226,Can't beat the Fitzwilliam,"We stayed here midweek for the night to see a panto next door in the opera house. We arrived before check in time but were still able to check in which was great. We had dinner booked for after the panto, 
service was swift and the food delicious. Cocktails followed which were also gorgeous as were the mocktails for the child. Always enjoy staying at the Fitzwilliam, service is always consistant, would always highly recommend a stay here.",5,2022,01,07

226,Great hotel and location just skip the breakfast,Wonderful hotel very close to the town hall and bus station. Fabulous room only let down by the overpriced breakfast that could have been a lot better. The orange juice tasted like concentrate not fresh and while the cooked breakfast was good it was not exceptional.,4,2022,01,02

226,Lovely hotel,"The hotel itself is beautiful, with friendly staff and a very comfortable bed. Our only complaint was the road noise in the room and that parking was not free considered the price paid for the room. If parking in the multi story across the road, make sure to get your ticket validated in the hotel reception before departure, as this gives you discount. This detail is not included on the website parking info, and was not explained prior to arrival and we ended up paying close to ¬£35 for parking. ",4,2022,01,01

Great location - thorough covid checks so feeling of safety
Lovely hotel rooms",4,2021,12,30
226,Lovely Christmas break,"Beautifully decorated....rooms have the wow factor. Worth spending a bit more to get better than basic room. Small touches in the room such as a nespresso machine and a great selection of toiletries. Large double shower was a great surprise and luxury. Weather wasn't good, surprise, but the room had an umbrella which was free to use, again above and beyond. 
Breakfast selection was brilliant, food quality equalled this. Service around the hotel was brilliant also. Very friendly and welcoming. ",5,2021,12,24

",5,2021,12,20
226,"relaxing, friendly, well appointed hotel","nothing was too much trouble for the staff, who were knowledgeable and efficient. We arrived very early, long before our appointed time, but Reception did their utmost to accommodate us. This was only the start of a quality weekend!",5,2021,12,20
226,Amazing Afternoon Tea,"What an amazing afternoon we had at this hotel.  
All organised by Stephanie for us.  She was so helpful and made this happen.
We arrived early but our table was ready and looked beautiful.
Brian looked after us and I have to say he was fantastic .  The service was amazing.  
The food was fantastic, from the soup to the sandwiches and sausage rolls, from the scones to the cakes.  There was lashings of tea and a lovely glass of prossecco. 
This is our third visit for afternoon tea and can‚Äôt wait to go back.",5,2021,12,20
226,Fabulous Hotel with 5 star service !,This Hotel in the centre of Belfast is fabulous from the moment you enter through the doors. Luxurious decor and 5 star service.

226,Lovely setting,"I had afternoon tea here with family & it was excellent. Staff very friendly & attentive. Very comfortable & private seating area. 
I will be back again. It‚Äôs just right beside the Grand Opera House so very convenient for pre-show drinks. Lovely Christmas experience.",5,2021,12,19
226,Average,Room was nice but would have liked a bath considering I paid extra for a signature view room. We waited a long time in lobby for drinks service and when husband tried to order a number of nibbles he was told there were none including ordering a drink from menu and being told oh sorry that‚Äôs an old menu. We ordered room service for breakfast (fry) and it arrived with one of everything-the plate looked pretty miserable and was cold-when we ordered extra this was hot. Coffee also cold. It just wasn‚Äôt 5star service in our opinion. Reception staff were lovely but didn‚Äôt see the point of online check-in and then having to do same on arrival.,3,2021,12,19
226,"Great stay, great staff, great hotel","Great friendly staff beautiful food and rooms.
From start to finish to experience was amazing.
We are actually gonna stay again this week for our christmas shopping
The ladies on the counter were fantastic and the food was amazing
Great experience all together and will recommend it to everybody",5,2021,12,19
226,Superb city centre hotel,We thoroughly enjoyed our three night stay at the Fitzwilliam.  The room was extremely comfortable and the food delicious.  We enjoyed breakfast each morning and there was an good choice.  We ate both in the restaurant and in the bar and both were superb.  The staff are friendly and helpful which makes such a difference and it is a great hotel to return to after a day‚Äôs sightseeing.  ,5,2021,12,18
226,Couples break,"Excellent hotel, spotless and felt covid safe at all times. Staff all very friendly and helpful. Bar lovely with live music on Saturday evening. Rooms had loads of little extras and bathroom was beautiful with shower and bath. Only slightly negative point was meal in restaurant as it was a set Christmas menu and was not great, to be fair the dessert was really good. ",5,2021,12,15
226,Not the 5* experience,"We stayed or 2 nights & expected a 5* experience. We certainly didn't receive it. Overpriced for the quality of service, food, room etc. Staff folding clean towels on corridor floor - how disgusting. Room not cleaned even though we were out of the hotel all day. Told by hotel they were down 2 members of staff & had to turn around 100 rooms. We don't need to hear things. Newspaper ordered & wasn't received. Food mediocre ",2,2021,12,14
226,More a 4*,"An ok hotel with scruffy staff who seemed a bit unsure of what they should be doing‚Ä¶ couldn‚Äôt get full milk for my toddler‚Äôs breakfast, was told to look online when asked for restaurant recommendations‚Ä¶ bare minimum frills. However it‚Äôs a good location, housekeeping were great and bed was comfy.",3,2021,12,14
226,Very enjoyable experience,"Can't fault anything at all. Very luxurious experience that I would definitely recommend. Hotel is located in the heart of Belfast and within walking distance of many shops, bars & restaurants. Staff very pleasant and would go the extra mile for guests.",5,2021,12,13
226,5* pricing 1* service.,Staff were rude and unprofessional on several occasions to our group while at dinner including inappropriate comments to several of our group. Waiting times for Bar were completely unacceptable.  Towels were covered in with stains upon arrival. Would not recommend to anyone based on my experience. ,1,2021,12,13
226,A Lovely Stay At The Fitzwilliam Hotel.,"In all, the food at dinner & the breakfast were delicious, the staff were very helpful & the room was clean with an unbelievable view of Belfast.

I personally would highly recommend the stay at the Fitzwilliam Hotel.",5,2021,12,13
226,"Superb location, comfy rooms, great reception.","Superb location, cosy, friendly and welcoming atmosphere, good clean and comfortable rooms (though a bit worn in places), and breakfast leaves a lot to be desired with a poor breakfast bar and anaemic Full Irish breakfast (sausage is delicious though). TV is unresponsive and reception is poor, mind you, these days with streaming options aplenty it's not a major issue,

Nevertheless the highs highly outweighs any lows, and I'll stay here again anytime I'm in Belfast for business and pleasure (couples). Had an excellent night's sleep, and the bathroom facilities are excellent.",4,2021,12,12
226,Wonderful hotel,"Beautiful hotel right in the centre of Belfast.  We stayed as a family with young children.  A place we'd choose for just the two of us, the staff were wonderful in including the children. Roo. Was fabulous,  loved the lounge to have a drink  and relax too. ",5,2021,12,12
226,Terrible,"Had a voucher that included a three course meal and when we went for dinner we were only offered two courses at a very very basic menu with no sides and all sides were extra. Were told the voucher was a ‚Äúmisprint‚Äù. Voucher also included free cocktail each which we weren‚Äôt offered which the staff said it must have been a misprint too. Breaking all consumer laws. We will never go back. 
For the record I‚Äôve never left a bad review before. Location is good and the room was nice but not worth the money, more like a 2 or 3 star hotel.",1,2021,12,11
226,Superb. Excellent in every way.,"I stay in a lot of hotels - including in Belfast. The Fitzwilliam is excellent. From comfort to staff to food, it's among the very best. Staff were helpful with every request, efficient, professional and very friendly. The room was quiet, comfortable and housekeeping did a wonderful job every day. Food was simply excellent. Highly recommend.",5,2021,12,10
226,Brilliant ,"Had such a brilliant stay with my partner and baby girl, all our needs were met, the staff were so friendly and really helpful, lovely to be greeted with a smile and friendly faces, room was very comfortable, spacious and clean, will definitely be back again ",5,2021,12,08
226,Superb stay,"I had a superb stay, sadly only for one night. From the moment I arrived at the hotel the staff went out of their way to make you feel welcome, everyone I met was so friendly and really genuine. The room I had was excellent - modern, comfortable bed, great shower and quiet.
Unfortunately the weather was shocking but I am glad it was because I decided to eat in the bar and had a great evening, Brian and his team were brilliant. The food was restaurant quality and they have a good selection of local Craft beers which I enjoyed tasting.
Breakfast the following morning was very good, I really liked the explanation of the suppliers they use locally - great provenance.",5,2021,12,08
226,Christmas weekend break,"Overall ambiance of hotel is relaxing, friendly and extremely clean and comfortable. Breakfast and evening meals both excellent, all produce local and fresh. Bar had music in the evening which was a bonus also",5,2021,12,06
226,Fabulous stay,"If you are going to Belfast then The Fitzwilliam is the place to stay. The staff are extremely friendly and their service is exceptional. Every member of staff that we interacted with went out of their way to accommodate our needs to ensure that we had a great stay at The Fitzwilliam. The hotel itself is located very near the city centre and all the shops, restaurants as well as Belfast City Hall are within a few minutes walking distance from the hotel. I cannot recommend staying here highly enough.",5,2021,12,06
226,2nd class Citizen,When I arrived at the hotel which I had pre paid ¬£395 I was greeted by the receptionist who asked me for a card I realised I had left my card in my bag and that was coming separately I was told no card no check in although I had paid for the room luckily I had Apple Pay felt like they treat me like a second class citizen and this marred my stay,2,2021,12,05
226,Excellent hotel with very attentive staff,"Our second stay at this wonderful hotel.  Excellent quality rooms, well appointed room and bathroom which is more like a spa than a bathroom.   Service is impeccable from check in, concierge and restaurant staff.  Highly recommended.  Close to city centre.  Can`t wait to go back again.",5,2021,12,04
226,Amazing,We made this reservation so that we could do some Christmas shopping and have dinner.. since we didn‚Äôt travel this year. I really enjoyed every min! The room was perfect and the shower was great too!! ,5,2021,12,02
226,Superb Experience,"We had a 3 night stay to catch up with family.  The hotel is well positioned and the rooms are very comfortable, clean, beautifully decorated we slept very well.
Breakfast was very good with a very varied menu to suit all tastes.  
Staff were ver friendly and helpful.
Would highly recommend.",5,2021,11,29
226,Underwhelmed & disappointed,"I really looked forward to staying here as a birthday break but it unfortunately didn‚Äôt live up to its reputation. There are some really positive things to say about this hotel - location is amazing, the majority of the staff are very welcoming and on the ball, bedrooms are really nice & cocktails are lovely. 

We stayed 2 nights & had breakfast on the second morning. We went at our allocated time of 10.15, the continental breakfast offering was really poor - nothing had been replenished from the earlier sittings. We waited 20 mins to order our hot breakfast & another 20 mins for it to arrive. When it did arrive, the order was wrong & when I pointed it out to our waiter he was dismissive and ultimately rude with no interest in correcting the mistake. The breakfast was cold & toast was inedible. 

The breakfast supervisor was great & apologised for the poor service and comped our breakfast which was appreciated. 
We experienced similar poor service in the bar. We queued for 15 mins which was fine as they where busy but there was no acknowledgement that we where even there. The Bar Supervisor was standing chatting to a group of girls & blatantly ignored us and others waiting in line. Our drink order was also wrong üôà

Overall I don‚Äôt think we will stay again. When paying over ¬£500 for 2 nights, I really expected something special but was left disappointed and underwhelmed. I expected a lot more from a ‚Äò5 Star‚Äô hotel.",3,2021,11,28
226,Happy,Great hotel.Very convenient location.Great staff .All willing to help and give tips about exploring the local area.Room was very comfortable and breakfast was excellent.I would be happy to return one day.,5,2021,11,27
226,Beautiful Hotel,Recently stayed here for 1 night but wish we‚Äôd had longer. Beautiful hotel and amazing bedrooms. Couldn‚Äôt have asked for more friendly and helpful staff. Really centrally located with everything on the drop step. Would definitely go back. ,5,2021,11,27
226,Fabulous stay,"Thanks for a fabulous stay. The hotel is absolutely gorgeous and perfect location, but the staff 100% make it! 
A thank you to Matthew for all his help and recommendations for Belfast, he was wonderful! As was everybody else, they had everything sorted for us before we could have even asked. We loved our stay and will be back!",5,2021,11,26
226,Bad attitude and customer service,"Having been to the hotel bar a few times and couldn't fault their excellent service, 5 of us arranged to meet up here for dinner and drinks. This was not the experience we had on Friday night, worst of all it was from the bar manager on duty. Served by a girl who had only been there 3 days (in no way her fault!) she had made an error when I paid for my wine (she entered it into the till separate rather than onto the table?). So before the manager took our order for cocktails we were told my wine was still outstanding, I explained it had been paid I was told 'NO IT WASNT'. My friend explained who took the money (new start - again, not her fault!). I was MORTIFIED! Managers response 'well, her shift is over' eventually saying 'well I'll have to phone her at home to confirm'. Randomly I remembered the money I used and the change I was given. I was the one chasing her explaining I wasn't stealing. After explaining I was brushed off after basically being accused of not paying! All the while the order for our cocktails wasn't taken until the wine issue was resolved. My friend asked to speak to her as she wasn't happy how this had all played out and the embarrassment of me, her response 'well, it's human error, I did apologise (not that I remember!) there's nothing else i can do, we do have people come in and not pay their bill' *snarky tone, well I'm not one of them!. Actually you could have offered us a free drink to apologise for the misunderstanding or even just a nicer attitude? Also the chef misread our order and part of one of the meals didn't arrive until we were finished (we weren't overly bothered as these things happen it just added to the evening) she did offer to take the 2 other items she had ordered (1 small plate, 1 side order) off the bill, very nice, but instead it was 2 side orders (cheapest option). No one came over to ask if everything was ok with the meal, again this could be a staffing issue? Not a huge deal.
My issue with Friday evening is with the bar managers attitude. I left the bar not wanting to go back. The new girl, the kitchen issue on top of restaurants/bars dealing with covid, being short staffed and trainees is to be expected and in no way bothered any of us (it was our first time out together in almost 2 years) but being accused of basically stealing really hasn't sat well with me, it has taken me 6 days to actually leave this review as I wouldn't normally complain but this bar/hotel will definitely be losing custom from us. Being in the city centre you are not spoilt for choice for other restaurants to try.",2,2021,11,25
226,Book it ,"Had great experience with this city centre hotel.
Smooth booking and super service throughout.
Rooms week kitted out . Two nights stay.
 Special shout out to Linda Gourley for her warm welcoming and friendly service in the bar/ restaurant.

226,Our night away.,"Me and my Fianc√© decided a trip to belfast was what was needed for her birthday. After having our first born we never really had time to ourselves so it was well over due. The stay was excellent, friendly staff, greeted by a very friendly concierge at the door who took our bags to our room. Fianc√© was extremely impressed with the room and she said walking out that she wants to do it again. Thank you to the staff at the Fitzwilliams Hotel for helping make our day great. ",5,2021,11,22
226,Paula & Alan Wedding Anniversary,It's a lovely hotel in a great location.  The food is very nice here and the staff are very friendly.  It could do with a pool as the majority of 5 star hotels I've stayed in do even if they are in a city.,4,2021,11,22
226,Magnificent hotel,"Best Hotel we have ever stayed in, the staff are so friendly and couldn't do enough for you from the minute you walk through the doors, luxurious rooms with everything you possibly need for a stay and more. The breakfast is a must, the variety on the cooked menu and the continental is huge and all very very tasty. ",5,2021,11,20
226,Short break,Disappointed with my stay here. Compared to other hotels I would not consider it 5 star. Full breakfast was minimal and lukewarm/cold. Queuing for staff to greet you for breakfast when dining area was quiet! ,3,2021,11,20

226,Would definitely stay here again,This hotel was amazing. From the front desk to the valet service. Everyone is friendly and so willing to help. Beds were super comfortable and bathrooms were beautiful. We are in the restaurant for dinner one evening and food was excellent. We had an issue with our sink draining and the attendant almost beat us to our room to fix it. Within walking distance to so many things. Went to a show at the opera house which was definitely unplanned but very good. It was right next door to the hotel. Would definitely stay here again. ,5,2021,11,15

226,Fabulous hotel.,Excellent hotel. Staff go above and beyond to make you feel welcome. The room was very comfortable and clean. Location is excellent. Overall we really enjoyed our experience and I would certainly recommend this hotel.,5,2021,10,29
226,Wonderful luxury in the heart of the city,"Had a wonderful stay in the Fitzwilliam, we had plenty to keep us busy within walking distance and the hotel umbrellas were a big bonus during the rain spells. ‚Ä®

We had an 8th floor view room and it was beautifully styled with all the amenities you could want and more in the room. My husband also loved the shower with its rainforest shower head. 

‚Ä®We would definitely recommend the Fitzwilliam and can‚Äôt wait to plan a return visit for ourselves. ‚Ä®‚Ä®Also I can‚Äôt forget to mention the staff, who were just outstanding. I am terrible with names but we had a wonderful member of staff check us in, the bar manager, the concierge and the waitress at dinner who suggested a fabulous wine to pair with our meal. They all were so accommodating and genuinely nice.",5,2021,10,29
226,Excellent will be back,Great place great location staff friendly food good rooms immaculate great value highly recommended will be back for sure nothing was a issue the hotel concierge was extremely helpful throughout the stay ,5,2021,10,29
226,Well located hotel with the friendliest of staff,"Hotel was great placed for arriving by airport bus (Airport Express 300), for picking up a tour nearby and for access to city hall, good restaurants and pubs, and for St George‚Äôs market (Fri-Sun).

Staff were incredibly friendly and willing to help. Our room was not available by the stated check in time so we were given a complimentary cocktail the bar - where we were met by a very knowledgable bar manager.

Room 506 (Executive Double) was very spacious, we took advantage of one of their deals on the website for that level room. Our bathroom could do with a little TLC as the shower rail was a little wobbly and the toiletries rack coming away from the wall slightly.

Cleaning service was brilliant, however the drinks box (tea, coffee, sugar, milk, was not restocked by the cleaning staff. Reception, however arranged for items to be sent up to the room as soon as requested, including fresh milk (as opposed to UHT cartons).

Never having had room service I decided to take advantage of late check out by having breakfast in bed. It was delightful, although 2 items were missed from the order.
 
The lobby area was stunning and definitely qualifies the five star look. ",4,2021,10,28
226,Not a good Choice for your Covid-19 safety.,"Many concerns here but the biggest one is Covid-19 policies. I felt very unsafe at this hotel. Policies in place are not carried out.  From the reception area to the buffet breakfast which was compromised to the fullest extent. Guests are hovering over the food without masks on. Masks are required especially where exposed food is served. 
I spoke to Lauren the Deputy Manager who didn't show any concern for my overall safety. The Concierge is also a disappointment. Choosing a Black Cab Tour who was not a sanctioned Black Cab tour Guide. He only presented one side of the story.  The room itself is outdated except for the decor. If you choose this hotel expect the standard room to be very small and an upgrade isn't much better.  You have a choice in Belfast. This is a 3-star hotel at best.  Don't choose this hotel without researching your options. Learn from my mistake!",2,2021,10,26
226,Good but staff shortages let down the overall experiance,"Room not cleaned before 6.00pm and not able to have breakfast where the two problems in an otherwise great stay at the Fitzwilliam 
Staff shortages meant that the some of the services at the hotel were compromised during my very recent stay ",4,2021,10,26
226,Luxurious attention to detail,amazing experience on a first trip to Belfast. Would look to stay here again for sure. The room was well appointed and always clean. the Staff were friendly and pleased to see guests. facilities were top notch.,5,2021,10,25
226,Nice hotel,"The hotel is good value considering how nice it is. Rooms are clean, and have lovely little details in. Room service was great and staff were friendly. The hotel is in a nice central location with easy access to public transport.",4,2021,10,24
226,Really lovely hotel,"Stayed here for 4 nights.  Service and the rooms were superb.  The porridge at breakfast was the best I have ever tasted.
Fantastic location.  Would love to stay here again if we ever return to Belfast.
The only downside was the restaurant was closed on the Sunday of our stay which was when we planned on eating there.",5,2021,10,22
226,Great Hotel,"The Fitzwilliam is a perfect choice - location, staff, food, room all 5 star. If you‚Äôre a vegan it‚Äôs really wonderful to have a chef who goes out of their way for you. My girlfriend and I had a superb time ",5,2021,10,22
226,Another fabulous stay at the Fitzwilliam,"We really enjoyed our stay this weekend, friendly and efficient staff, a very comfortable, well equipped and stylish room and an excellent and plentiful breakfast. Faultless. A must stay hotel in Belfast, we will be back again.",5,2021,10,19
226,Ireland Trip,The hotel was worth every penny. From the minute we arrived to the minute we left the staff were amazing. The best hotel we ever stayed in. The only downside that let it down was the lack of staff in the restaurant at breakfast and dinner.,5,2021,10,17
226,Excellent city centre hotel,Great location for a city break. Rooms very comfortable. Nice public areas. Breakfast was excellent. Staff were friendly and efficient. Little candle in bathroom which was a nice touch. Little bottle of bubble bath would have made it perfect ,5,2021,10,17
226,A Beautiful Hotel Convenient to Dining & Shopping in the City Center,"The Fitzwilliam is a historic hotel in Belfast City Center. It is convenient walking distance to many shopping, dining, and public transportation options.

Our standard room was spacious and clean. It was very nicely appointed. One drawback, due to the historic nature of the hotel, is the lack of wall outlets. We counted three outlets in our room. There was an outlet including USB ports on one side of the bed. We were able to charge our phones and a computer without issue. The bathroom did not have anywhere to plug in a hair dryer, which we found common in European hotels during our trip.

Breakfast was included in the price of our stay. The breakfast was very good. There were hot options from a menu, as well as a continental spread with fruit, pastries, yogurt, and fruit juices, among other things. There were even a few individually packaged gluten free bakery items on a separate table. During our stay, a reservation was required for breakfast. We didn't eat any other meals at the hotel.

The staff was friendly and accommodating with all of our needs.

The Fitzwilliam is a lovely hotel and we would definitely stay here again.",5,2021,10,15
226,Really great choice.,"This is a really good hotel. Very comfortable rooms, great service. Location is excellent, particulalry if  you're coming in from the airport as it's very close to the terminal for the 300x Airport Express. ",5,2021,10,15
226,Our overnight stay,"We were very disappointed with this hotel. It is not a 5 star standard. We won‚Äôt be returning. We were never told the main restaurant for dinner was closed, bathroom had no area to leave our own toiletries. Totally impractical. We had to leave them on the floor.",2,2021,10,14
226,A great hotel in a great location,"From check in to departure the staff at this hotel were friendly, hard working and helpful. Nothing was too much trouble.
When we arrived for a very early check in, the concierge and duty manager that day, organised tickets for us to visit the titanic museum. He gave us a map and explained the city and the different locations.
The bar staff were great. Hard working and very friendly.
Our rooms were amazing. Everything you would expect from a 5 star hotel. Would definitely stay here again.",5,2021,10,12
226,A real treat of an afternoon tea!,"We booked for the afternoon tea on Saturday before going to the opera house and it did not disappoint. Firstly, there was such a variety and the starter halloumi bites and cup of tomato soup was a nice opening. 

All the sweet bakes were delicious, we didn‚Äôt want to leave anything! My favourites being the mini apple and cinnamon pie with meringue and the melt in the mouth shortbread. Everything was divine.

Excellent service and the staff were brilliant with my 8 year old daughter who was thoroughly enjoying the whole experience.

They didn‚Äôt even charge full price for her even though she ate just as much as us! ¬£105 for 4 people (including a child), all the yummy food, a glass of Prosecco or mocktail which my daughter loved! Very reasonable for such quality.

Highly recommend!",5,2021,10,10
226,‚ÄòWe‚Äôre too busy- you don‚Äôt matter‚Äô,"The hotel looks lovely and is perfectly located but I have to say, after just a one night stay I feel total deflated and really cross with myself for booking the Fitzwilliam.
We were going to the GOH to see Six The musical so we booked because it close and looked like a nice place to stay for me and my teenage daughter. The website promised cleanliness, friendliness and attention to detail. 
I would not rate their cleanliness or attention to detail very highly- there were red stains on the floor, there was a build up on dust on the desk and apparently the hoover doesn‚Äôt reach the corners of the carpet - the grubby marks on the wall and the mildew around the shower should‚Äôve been warning signs! It did not feel clean or very covid secure. 
Anytime we interacted with staff- we were told immediately how busy they were and how they may not be able to help. The bar staff in particular were rather rude- yes a female and her teenage daughter may not be lucrative clients for spending big bucks on a cocktail menu, so we were told pre-show we couldn‚Äôt have any drinks because they were far too busy. Then post show, they were far too busy as well and could only give us a table in the bar for an hour‚Ä¶ it took them over half that time time to bring us drinks.. and when we ordered another.. guess what.. they were far too busy to serve us again. Talk about feeling like a burden. This was general cycle events. Even ordering room service breakfast.. yes.. they were far too busy to take the call, when they did, it took a further 15 minutes waiting on the line to see if our request could be granted.
So save yourself some time and go somewhere where you do matter. I have no idea who they were far too busy with but we were obviously not in the important people club. It just really annoys me that I gave them my money to be made feel like crap by every person we came into contact with.  There was one exception. Nigel, the concierge. He was an absolute gentleman and the only person who seemed to have time for this mother and daughter duo. Thank you Nigel.",3,2021,10,10
226,"Belfast ""Go To"" Hotel","Never stayed he before so gave this a go, excellent value fir a proper 5 star hotel. Great staff, from reception, concierge, bar staff all superbly friendly and helpful. Great rooms, bathroom had separate bath and walk in shower which I really like. Great bed with super pillows, this is what you want when you travel allot. ",5,2021,10,07
226,21st birthday trip.,"Absolutely wonderful hotel, efficient, friendly staff who couldn‚Äôt do enough for us. The trip was for my daughter‚Äôs 21st birthday and the staff went above and beyond to ensure she had the best time. We‚Äôll definitely be back!!",5,2021,10,07
226,SHE SAID YES,"The Best There Is In Belfast keep it up guys, you helped me with decorations etc the food was the best and staff was amazing....kudos to you guys I would recommend anyone visiting Belfast to try and stay nights or more ",5,2021,10,06
226,Lacklustre,Unfortunately had a list of problems with the room and what was supposed to a relaxing time away has exhausted me. Due to the amount of issues we had we received a compensatory stay so truly hoping our next stay is better.,3,2021,10,06
226,Enjoyable stay but not 5*,"Lovely hotel and staff but just not a 5* experience. Food was nice but again not 5*. Staff very friendly and accommodating so definitely would stay again. It was clean and warm, well appointed rooms, although a little dark. ",4,2021,10,05
226,Very comfortable hotel in a good location,"The hotel rooms are roomy and comfortable, the breakfast extravagant, and the concierge staff extremely helpful. The seating area in the lobby has a fireplace, and the bar is very nice. The only reason I didn't give it five stars is that the decor seems a bit dated. ",4,2021,10,04
226,Fitzwilliam executive king room,"Room was lovely, bed was very comformtable, most staff where friendly, however, shower door did not close properly, hair dryer did not work, and there was no bacon or mushrooms with breakfast which was promised on the menu ",4,2021,10,04
226,Spectacular stay,An amazing hotel with everything catered for the staff are friendly and helpful especially Philip the concierge but everyone went above and beyond to make it a memorable experience a real gem in Belfast‚Äôs crown. ,5,2021,10,04
226,Amazing ,"We stayed at The Fitzwilliam last weekend and it was incredible. 

The room was beautifully designed, immaculate and countless extra touches to make you feel at home. The staff were very friendly, especially Phillip who took the time out to share some local recommendations. 

Breakfast was great too! 

Thank you, we hope to return. ",5,2021,10,03
226,Lovely hotel,Booked for a birthday celebration.hotel room was lovely (cityview room) it was well equipped and spotlessly clean and had a nice view of cavehill.the bed was very comfortable!we had dinner in the restaurant.food was lovely..great choice for breakfast and again was lovely.. throughout our stay staff were all friendly and attentive.hotel is very central and walking distance to city centre.i would definitely book again.,5,2021,10,01

226,Great hotel and service,"Would recommend this hotel, the concierge team were brilliant and very knowledgeable. The breakfast was delicious and kept us going as we explored the city and beyond. The hotel is in a good location and walking distance to all key things to do
Room was v comfortable.",5,2021,09,27
226,"Lovely place, friendly staff, good location - pricey!","Great location, friendly staff, aesthetically pleasing hotel but not quite 5 star standard rooms. 
Some wear & tear, marked walls, peeling door, slightly moulded shower seal & a stained bathrobe let the image down a little bit. 
But the welcome from staff and accessibility to the city was superb! ",3,2021,09,27
226,Very average hotel,"Uncomfortable, small beds, small rooms, and average breakfast. Didn't feel like a 5 star hotel. Value for money was not good. 250 pounds per room per night is far too much. Staff were friendly especially Jamie on reception ",3,2021,09,27
226,Excellent city centre hotel,Very high standard of room and food. Bar food was excellent as was breakfast. Room was a little small but lovely view of cave hill. Good tea and coffee making facilities and bathroom toiletries were very nice.,5,2021,09,26
226,Not a 5 star hotel - 3 max,"Good location, and service is fine - but by no way a 5 star hotel, iron and lots of lights in the room didn‚Äôt work - in hindsight should of stayed at the jury‚Äôs inn opposite.  Would be interested to know what the criteria these guys met to call themselves 5 star.",2,2021,09,26
226,Highly recommend,"Beautiful hotel right in the city centre, staff were exceptionally helpful especially the concierge who help us track down my passport when I dropped it while I was out. 
The room was comfortable and well stocked with tea/coffee, water and a good selection of nice toiletries. The whole hotel had very high cleaning standards. 
The reception are was modern and very relaxing and the bar area was fine. They maybe could have used another bar staff as it was busy at times 
Would definitely stay here again if I‚Äôm back in Belfast",5,2021,09,25
226,Excellent,"The hotel decor is modern and has a warm and friendly atmosphere.  The staff team are all excellent.  Our room
Floor 8 has great views over the city.
Location: An easy walk to most attractions.  Theatre next door and rail/bus 100 yds away.  Titanic walkable.",5,2021,09,23
226,Outstanding,"I booked the private dining room at The Fitzwilliam to celebrate my partners 40th birthday and it was absolutely outstanding!

Stephanie who managed the whole booking process was superb and extremely efficient in all my correspondence with her.

Upon our arrival we where met by James who along with his team looked after us all exceptionally well. Suggesting wines to pair with our meal and explaining all of the menu choices before each course.

He made us comfortable and nothing was too much trouble (even forgetting candles for the cake wasn‚Äôt an issue).

Although we didn‚Äôt stay in the hotel, we can safely confirm this will not be the last time we visit the hotel, we cannot wait to come back!

Thanks to everyone at Team Fitzwilliam",5,2021,09,20
226,Exceptional 5 Star Experience,"Excellent service from start to finish from a very high skilled professional team, warmth, pampered couldn't do enough for you. Room was very comfortable, private and elegant. Food was of the highest quality. By far the best service and the best hotel in Belfast.",5,2021,09,19
226,Great stay!!,"Absolutely love this hotel. Have stayed here a few times over the years & never fails to impress. As soon as we checked in with Jamie at reception (who I might add was very welcoming & professional!) we felt relaxed & ready to enjoy our stay. Room was perfect, good sound system, classy decor & great coffee! Enjoyed a beautiful cocktail by the fire late on in the evening. Just perfect! Can‚Äôt wait to get back! Thanks again to Jamie who we checked out with this morning. All in all a really good stay!",5,2021,09,18
226,High quality in Belfast,"Very well appointed and spacious  room, excellent and friendly staff.  Quality of drinks in the bar and the breakfast was first class. Well located for the bus from the airport and with day trip operator around the corner. City Hall and the tourist centre and bus stops minutes walk away so perfect as I didn‚Äôt have a car.  
Can‚Äôt fault my stay.",5,2021,09,18
226,Positively Perfect,In every way this property will make your stay in Belfast the best it can be. Our party was extremely happy with the accommodations and the staff were first class and so helpful and efficient. We were only in town for two days but we were treated exquisitely from the moment we arrived until we checked out. The concierge staff knows everything about Ireland and go out of their way to make sure your trip is the best it can be.,5,2021,09,17
226,Celebration,"Overpriced rooms probably due to location. Rooms average quite dark a little shabby with lots of mirrors. Staff were very attentive and friendly. We had a lovely celebration.  However, Bed was uncomfortable, not what I expect from 5 star hotel ",3,2021,09,16
226,One the best hotel experiences in Belfast!,"Everything was excellent from start to finish. Great service, straightforward check in, pleasant staff, room gorgeous & spacious, value for money. Breakfast was delicious.
We can't wait to return and are already planning our next trip.",5,2021,09,15
226,Excellent Hotel,"Great location, very comfortable and welcoming. We will definitely visit again. The hotel is very close to the city centre and easily walkable. The hotel staff were all very helpful and welcoming and the hotel was extremely comfortable and well designed. ",5,2021,09,13
226,Excellent ,"Excellent hotel to stay in. Perfect location and everyone we met in the hotel were so friendly from start to finish. Matthew the concierge was incredible and helped us plan dinner etc. We were really impressed with Jacob and Patrick in the bar, their whiskey knowledge is exceptional and they were a delight. The hotel made our visit really special and it is a beautiful spot to stay in. Great gem in the city. The only comment I would make is that the breakfast isn't great, we had it delivered to room both mornings as limited availability at the restaurant and it was overcooked. Other than that a great trip and we will definitely stay again. ",5,2021,09,13
226,Comfortable stay but not a 5* star hotel for me.,"Firstly the positives. This hotel is designed well and the rooms comfortable, especially the bed. It‚Äôs clean and our room was nice to come back to after a long day. This is where the positives end. I expect from a 5 star hotel a first class service with the staff to be very attentive. However, from check in the service felt cold and we were just another customer through the door. I understand restrictions with Covid but I didn‚Äôt get that important customer feeling. I felt like I was putting the concierge out for looking after our bags until our room was ready! The hotel stay was uneventful until the last night when the couple next door started having a big argument at midnight and woke me up. The walls were thin enough to hear it all. Also their doors slamming in anger meant I didn‚Äôt get back to sleep for another hour. The question next would be what did the hotel think? They don‚Äôt know because on check out they never asked how my stay was. I wasn‚Äôt also asked if I needed ongoing transport after checkout. Yes, maybe I could have raised the issue of the night before, but felt it may have gone on deaf ears.",3,2021,09,11
226,First class hotel - highly recommend,"Loved this hotel. Excellent location with a 2 minute walk to the City Halls. Private and secure parking with valet service. 
Staff could not be more friendly. 
Room was fabulous - a king suite. Large and very comfortable. 
Breakfast was first class with many choices. 
I cannot recommend this hotel highly enough.",5,2021,09,11
226,Fabulous hotel,Great staff great hotel. Excellent stay. Number one hotel in Belfast for me. Staff went way beyond their usual job. Food & drinks were superb & overall great value for money. I would certainly recommend this hotel to all our friends,5,2021,09,11
226,Excellent,"Room had everything you could have wanted and bed was extremely comfortable. Staff were wonderful, very attentive and knowledgeable. Excellent city centre location within walking distance of main attractions.",5,2021,09,10
226,Weekend away ,"Location is great ,close to a lot restaurants and shops within walking distance. 

Food was Brilliant good selection .

Clean and tidy everywhere .

Room lovelyclean and tidy.

Staff excellent every department.

Can't wait to return. Highly recommended ",5,2021,09,09
226,Solid 4 star but struggle with it being 5,A decent hotel. Lacks some ambiance and is a modern building and there are others in the city that seem to have more history / interesting buildings.  The hotel is well located to explore the city. Service good. I just struggle with this being seen as a 5 star and it disappoints on that basis. Plus the lifts need a good service!  If you want cheaper parking the ncp tannery is 5 mins walk at ¬£15 per day and you can get 20% off if you register for the app.,4,2021,09,09
226,Weekend away,"Staff super friendly. Made everything look effortless. Location perfect. We walked everywhere. Just one or two things. No vegan or vegetarian menu. For a five star very disappointed as I did mention it at time of booking, however chef did try a accommodate but dish disappointing. Five staff effort. Room spacious, clean lovely bathroom. To me I was disappointed that for a five star no coffee machine and no ture down service as advertised. (But this may be due to COVID). I would stay here again if visiting Belfast but a different room. ",5,2021,09,08
226,Not a 5 star experience.,"The room was dusty and we had to request an extra clean due to very dirty walls, it looked as though someone had sneezed or coughed tea over it. I would expect a more thorough clean especially with COVID. Then I was served a drink in the bar with lipstick on the glass. Not a 5 star experience as expected. Not good value. My wife was very disappointed and I was treating her after recently getting married. ",2,2021,09,07
226,Fantastic,"Great stay - wonderful staff, room and food. Would definitely be my go to hotel in Belfast. Very central to everything. Concierge service was great as were all the staff throughout our stay. Rooms are gorgeous too ",5,2021,09,06
226,Over all stay at the fitzwilliam hotel,Fantastic hotel friendly staff very clean rooms good perfect loved the style of the rooms and a great superking bed we would recommend this hotel to our friends thank you for a great stay we came for my husband‚Äôs birthday and staff did acknowledge this beautiful bun and card in the room when we arrived ,5,2021,09,06
226,Worst hotel,"Booked a room for my fianc√©‚Äôs birthday the suite was heavy with dust, bathrobes weren‚Äôt fresh, we were getting charged for bed and breakfast which was included in our package, the receptionist was very cheeky on arrival, my fianc√© used their soap which burnt her skin on her face I brought her down to reception at 12:30 at night with our bags and complained, we were told the next day we would get a call about a refund but never received one. So I rang myself the next day only to be told that the guy I complained to only mentioned I had complained about dust. I had requested for happy birthday to be wrote on my fianc√©‚Äôs desert and happy birthday to be sung which never happened either the staff handled the situation very badly and were very unprofessional. My fianc√©‚Äôs birthday is ruined and now she has had to go home late at night with her face bright red and burning because of their products which they have took no consideration to this is by far the worst hotel I have stayed in to date would not recommend.",1,2021,09,05
226,1 night anniversary,"As expected from previous visits this was an excellent night away, warm welcome at reception, room was superb, bed very comfortable, great shower, well stocked mini bar etc etc.
1 issue with the hotel is the lack of parking as it is central Belfast and the exuberant cost to park if arranged through the hotel is overnight, ¬£25.
The car park behind the bus station at Glengall street charges ¬£7 overnight. 
This aside I would be very happy to stay again. ",5,2021,09,05
226,Leisure,Upon arrival the concierge brought our car into the car park for us as we checked in . This was made easier by checking in online earlier. The room was absolutely fabulous and well laid out. We booked a table in the restaurant for that night and we were treated to an amazing meal and brilliant service from staff. The bar was again beautifully laid out and again staff catered for our every need . Highly recommended stay ,5,2021,09,05
226,Amazing from start to finish,"Everything about this hotel is fabulous. The service, the staff, the rooms, the breakfast was to die for and the decor is so stylish, modern and luxurious. We loved every minute and will definitely be back. Thank you. ",5,2021,09,05
226,Nothing to fault!,"Stayed here for 3 nights room only 30 august.  Literally 2 minutes walk from Europa bus station and on arrival rather early we were given our room which I was really impressed with!

When booking I asked for a quiet room and this is exactly what we got at the back of the hotel at the end of a corridor.  As a light sleeper this is really important to me and we did not hear anything or anyone for the full duration!

We ate in the restaurant one night food and staff excellent and very accommodating with my intolerance.  

Just a perfect hotel so central to everything we were able to walk everywhere (40 mins to titanic).

Nothing to complain about and wouldn‚Äôt hesitate should we find ourselves in Belfast again.",5,2021,09,04
226,Super stylish spot,"Loved our visit to the Fitzwilliam. Service and comfort level was top class and a great location. Beautiful lobby and we received a very, very warm welcome after- long day of travelling. We‚Äôll definitely be back. ",5,2021,09,04
226,Ok for a quick stop over but not 5 star,"Booked a mid week night to celebrate our engagement. We normally love treating ourselves once or twice a year in another 5 star establishment in the City Centre, but we thought we would try here for a change. Unfortunately, it does not live up to the 5 star ‚Äòexperience‚Äô that is promised. 
Staff on the desk were polite but we had to engage them in conversation and almost prompt them to talk to us in order to fill awkward silences. Some of the ladies were more concerned with huddling together and talking to each other than even looking at us.  
When we did get up to our room, the card and sweet treats congratulating us on our engagement was a nice touch so thank you. 
However, when we opened the mini fridge to store a bottle of Prosecco, it was half empty with opened tins of coke on the shelves, empty chocolate wrappers and a number of the mini alcohol bottles missing. I contacted the front desk so as to make sure I wouldn‚Äôt be charged upon leaving if the fridge hadn‚Äôt been checked between ourselves and the last guests that occupied the room before us. A young man did make his way to our room fast enough though and happily removed the rubbish and replaced the items as they should have before we arrived. Certainly not 5 star expectations however.
We did only use the hotel as a base as we had dinner and drinks booked elsewhere so the location is handy enough. The room was clean and tidy if a tad small. I found the bed uncomfortable but my other half was happy enough.
If it‚Äôs a proper 5 star experience you‚Äôre after, I would google the only actual 5 red star hotel in Belfast and give there a try.",3,2021,09,02
226,Fantastic hotel only beaten by its even better staff,"Amazing stay here, staff went above and beyond. Super friendly and attentive, not one single problem. Our room was amazing as were our guests rooms. We ate breakfast here and also in the Bar and Restaurant. All excellent and very flexible with food intolerances. Every single person who worked here whom we interacted with were a credit to the hotel.",5,2021,09,02
226,5 star in every way!,"I had booked this hotel to stay in for a couple of nights after we got married. A congratulations dessert was left in the room and the staff could not have done enough for us. The rooms are stunning, kept to a very high standard with gorgeous views of Belfast. Definitely a 5 star experience in every way! We can‚Äôt wait to go back.",5,2021,09,02
226,Not 5star (stayed in better 3star) (BUT EXCELLENT RECEPTION STAFF),"Stayed here Sunday. Reception staff are nice and very helpful told me I could pay for my breakfast and any drinks at the end of my stay. Got to the room  and it looks lovly but small things like not correctly dusted, dust on pictures and mirrors. Windows didn't close correctly (didn't annoy me but if it was windy or in winter I wouldn't like to be in the room). The room did look good but small said details means it shouldn't be 5star. 
The evening we checked in we went to the bar for a drink the waiter that met us was rude and seemed like he didnt like his job atall he was also not dressed very well (shirt not tucked in looked messy). The bar staff seemed much more professional. When I went to leave I was made pay for my drink while other couples could just get up and go (don't know if this is because I'm young or from the South but felt kinda wierd after the reception told me I could pay at the end) 
Got up the next morning for breakfast and was once again made pay straight away, I don't mind this as it has to be paid for anyway but as I was told I could pay for it at the end. Breakfast was good sausages and bacon could of been cooked better but this is my own preference so can't really fault that I still ate it all. 

Unfortunately I was ment to stay a second night but due to the passing of a friend I had to leave early. The reception staff couldn't be kind enough and helped me get refunded from bookings.com 

Reception staff 5star 
Everything else 1star",2,2021,08,31
226,Enjoyable stay,"Centrally located and well presented hotel, overall a nice experience but a couple of things lead me not to give a 5 star rating.

Firstly, I should say that I think that COVID restrictions are stripping away the personality of hotels at the moment, but the staff here are coping really well, hats off to them.

On arrival our luggage went missing for over an hour, which was a bind as we both wanted to freshen up after travelling and before going out. That said, Declan the concierge put everything right and was extremely apologetic, also throwing in a bottle of Prosecco. Like all the staff we met there he was top notch, polite and friendly.

The room was well appointed and equipped, bed was large and comfy.
Breakfast was lovely and a range of choices.

Some negatives

WiFi was atrocious and was continually dropping out whilst we were there.

The sink was not draining at all well and the toilet hardly ever flushed properly. The former was put right after it was reported.

We took afternoon tea, but it didn't blow either of us away, a couple of the sandwiches were dry and had probably been standing for a while. Nothing was explained, there was no choice of teas and it certainly wasn't a five star experience.

We paid handsomely for our 3 night stay, well above the odds in my opinion. Including car parking it was close to ¬£1000. Perhaps a legacy of COVID, whilst I would not hesitate to return I would expect to pay much less than that.",4,2021,08,30
226,Fabulous one night stay,"From the moment we drew up in the car to the moment we sadly drove away the experience of the Fitzwilliam was outstanding. From the ambience of the facilities, the friendliness and professionalism of the staff to the variety and quality of food served. One of the best hotel experiences we have ever had. Thank you so much",5,2021,08,30
226,Great location!,"Perfect location for exploring the city. Loads of nice places to eat close by. Hotel is lovely, rooms comfortable and clean although need a slight upgrade of fittings to make it 5 star for me. Staff all very friendly. Would stay again. ",4,2021,08,29
226,Not a 5* experience,"Just home from a one night stay here for a date night with my partner. First of all i would say that the bar staff were amazing however i just didn't get a 5star experience with this hotel. Room is lovely and it was really clean but i dont feel like it's special enough to say it's 5*. Nice enough stay but i dont think id stay again! I don't  mind paying for a 5star hotel when you are getting the 5star experience & amenities, the only thing 5* about this hotel are the prices lol.",3,2021,08,29
226,Highly recommend ,"1st time staying at the Fitzwilliam we weren't disappointed. Room was lovely, clean and quiet. Great nights sleep. Staff courteous and friendly. Food excellent in the evening and breakfast. We like to stay a night in Belfast so will definitely go back. ",5,2021,08,29

V friendly staff..room was spotless..
Breakfast was v good..
Special touch was my birthday & had card & pastry waiting for me on arrival at room ..

Would highly recommend ",5,2021,08,28
226,Amazing service,"Amazing service, great friendly staff, clean and comfortable rooms, great sleep quality, lovely and high quality breakfast service, bar was great with personalised service delivery. The majority of the staff went above and beyond.",5,2021,08,28
226,Wheelchair Accessible Room = very good," I stayed here with my partner. I booked a wheelchair accessible room (wheelchair user). I was provided with detailed information on the room and it's accessible facilities on request. This helped me to make my decision to book a room. The room overall was of excellent standard, very comfortable and cosy. Food in the restaurant was very tasty and worth the price. Staff were very helpful and friendly. I'd recommend a stay here. Particularly if you require an accessible, high class booking.",5,2021,08,27
226,Great hotel,"5 star service for a 4 star price. The rooms are spacious, full of light and decorated with a great style. Great location, great breakfast. The staff was helpful in every circumstances. Including allowing us to check in at 7.30 in the morning. I will definitely stay here again. ",5,2021,08,27
226,Comfy and well located,Excellent spot for a long weekend trip. Rooms are spacious and clean and service is excellent. The hotel is also very well located and within walking distance of many restaurants and bars and only a short way away from city and international airports. Would stay again.,5,2021,08,26
226,Amazing,"We have stayed here every year for the past 7 years. We love it, staff and rooms exceptional. Nothing too much trouble. So handy as right beside main transport and close to bars and restaurants, sightseeing and shopping. ",5,2021,08,24
226,Nice hotel,"Nice hotel friendly staff food was also nice, hotel Is located near enough  big shopping centre, room was clean warm and cosy, over all my stay was good I was very happy I book this hotel but... unfortunately there is no free car park ,hotel will charge you 25¬£ (A day)  if you want to leave your car at the hotel car park and I think that's wrong but that's only a small thing",5,2021,08,23
226,Vegan afternoon tea ,"We visited the Fitzwilliam Hotel for afternoon tea as a special treat for my Mum's 75th birthday.  We specifically chose this place as they offered a vegan afternoon tea as my Mum is dairy intolerant.  We all chose to have the vegan afternoon tea and we were very impressed.  The atmosphere was lovely,  the staff very attentive and polite and the food was delicious. 

The scones with the coconut cream were absolutely amazing.  They tasted so good. All of the food was very well presented and tasty.  Our compliments to the chef as they did a fantastic job.  We stayed and had a cocktail and some wine afterwards which we really enjoyed too.

Would definitely visit again whenever we return to Belfast ",5,2021,08,23
226,Weekend Stay,"Amazing hotel, stayed for the weekend with a friend for a girls trip. The amazing location and phenomenal staff of the hotel really set it apart. Particularly the concierge staff - very friendly and helpful nothing was an trouble!",5,2021,08,23
226,It's all about the details,"One would expect great things from a Five star hotel and the Fitzwilliam Belfast certainly delivers on all the essentials for an enjoyable stay. ...but with an added ingredient,  They make you feel special, which is something many hotels fall short on.  Here they get the details so right to make your stay a memorable occasion. ",5,2021,08,23
226,"Awesome hotel, staff and bar","After three pre Covid booking cancellations attempts we made it and weren‚Äôt disappointed. Hotel, staff and the wonderful bar just made our break to Belfast the best.  So friendly and helpful, room awesome and loved the hand sanitiser lol üòÇ great location you need to book here",5,2021,08,21
226,Fabulous Hotel,"Just back from a two night stay, from start to finish it was fantastic. All the staff, from Check In, Concierge, Bar Staff , Waiters and General Manager, Cian Landers were all very efficient and extremely friendly and helpful. The breakfast had a fantastic choice not to be missed,  not to forget the amazing cocktails in the bar. We were lucky enough to have a Jr. Suite which was beautiful and had a great city view. We can't wait to return as it was truly a fantastic stay here, highly recommend.",5,2021,08,21
226,Trip to Belfast,"Excellent stay at hotel, staff are welcoming and provide an excellent service. 

Nigel (concierge) provided an outstanding service and excellent advice to ensure we made the most of our time in Belfast. Thank you. ",5,2021,08,20
226,Brilliant stay,"Great room, very good and friendly service, great cocktails. Room was very quiet and had a great sleep. Can not fault it and look forward to coming back! Perfect location in the city. Price also very reasonable. ",5,2021,08,19
226,"Great place, Great Location and great staff","Really lovely experience at the hotel  Concierge helped massively when we arrived spent ages with us.    Room very neat and tidy.  Breakfast was amazing with great service.   Would stay again    Location is perfect close to everything, even the city bus stopped outside...  ",5,2021,08,19
226,Staycation,"Family break, mum and daughter catch up after COVID and lockdown.  Excellent location, within walking distance to the city centre and train.  The staff where very helpful our room was ready early the concierge kindly took our luggage to our rooms while we went shopping.  The cocktails where out of this world and breakfast was delicious.",4,2021,08,18
226,Great stay,"It was the night of and after our wedding, the hotel ensured we had a congratulation surprise in the room which was lovely.  Very stylish hotel and the breakfast was very delicious. We ended up staying for an extra night so we could properly enjoy the room after all the wedding hype",5,2021,08,18
226,"Usual city hotel, good location",The best thing about this hotel was the location. Rooms were clean and well presented. My husband and I had a disappointingly small room on the 8th floor with a king bed. Our 2 adult children had a twin room on the 3rd floor that was much better sized with a bath and shower. Breakfast was good but pricey at ¬£20 pp especially as our daughter only had a bagel.  The bar and lobby area is small and if you're into fitness the gym is tiny. We didn't eat in the restaurant as it was closed due to a COVID scare. Overall a decent city hotel but don't expect 5 star amenities despite the price.,4,2021,08,16
226,"Fitzwilliam, Belfast",Very clean and comfortable. The beds are really comfortable. Staff very friendly. Had a drink in the bar and service was top class. The  only disappointment was the cooked breakfast which was not hot (barely warm) and dry. ,4,2021,08,16
226,Sadly Disappointed,"I‚Äôve stayed at the Fitz for over 9  years I‚Äôve always loved the hotel. However this time I‚Äôm so disappointed. I booked a Deluxe Junior Suite. We used to love the studio suites but they replaced those. The room was nice but it had a lot of maintenance issues and things that need replaced. Around the window of the room had not been cleaned was thick with dust. The room furniture was all chipped doors and around the bath wood all tired looking. The carpet needs replaced as it has massive red wine stains on it. The shower head has been replaced I like how it‚Äôs eco water friendly. The cupboard maintenance shaft kept opening in the shower area you could hear all the waste pipes etc and it was think with dirt. The sinks where not clean looking and the shower not properly cleaned. 

Overall I‚Äôm not going to sit an point out the negatives but this is meant to be a 5* hotel. I paid good money for the stay but left feeling let down. The main reason for this was the bar staff on the Friday night we returned from having dinner and a few drinks in town. To be great by a grumpy rude server. Questioning us and being very awkward and he was not wearing a mask. As residents I didn‚Äôt feel very welcomed at all. Housekeeping where great and discreet. Welcoming could have been better wasn‚Äôt helped from car with baggage. Upon checkout was awkward was not asked how my stay was. They tried to charge me again on my credit card for the stay even though they had a preauthorised payment pending on my Amex. Girl didn‚Äôt have a clue hunting for it. I had to login to my account to show them it. Shambles to be honest for a 5*. Deeply regret to say this but this will be my last stay in the fitz.",3,2021,08,16
226,Fabulous Hotel,"We had a great two nights in this lovely hotel.  Clean, comfortable and friendly, helpful staff.  Centrally placed in Belfast, very handy for restaurants, bars and sightseeing. I would definitely stay here again. ",5,2021,08,15
226,Excellent hotel,"A really fabulous hotel, staff very friendly and helpful, breakfast was amazing.  Would definitely like to go back to this luxurious hotel.  Belfast is an amazing place and very friendly, an amazing break",5,2021,08,15
226,Delightful!,Very clean and stylish hotel in the heart of the action in Belfast. The staff (in particular the concierge) are extremely friendly and looking to make your stay as delightful as possible. We stayed for four nights and did tours of the surrounding areas and were very pleased. Great breakfast each morning with buffet and a la carte options too. Great spot to park your weary bones as you discover the charms of Belfast and the rest of Northern Ireland!,5,2021,08,14
226,Not a 5 star hotel,Disappointing stay on August 5th. Our dinner was unfortunately cancelled in the hotel. This could not be helped due to staffing but the communication from staff was very poor and only that I overheard that the restaurant was closed I wouldn‚Äôt of been informed til an hour before due to dine. Breakfast equally was poor as waited over 40 minutes as order was never given to the kitchen. I rely on trip advisor reviews and reason I booked this hotel in first place. I do not feel this is a 5 star experience and was a disappointing stay. And not value for money.,2,2021,08,13
226,"Excellent location, friendly staff, delicious food and great property all round","I could not fault the hotel in any way. The staff are friendly, the room was in perfect condition, the food was delicious and the whole experience was luxurious so thank you to everyone at the Fitzwilliam hotel",5,2021,08,13
226,Belfast stay,We had a great stay at the fitzwilliam hotel. All the staff were very friendly. The location of the Hotel is very good and there is a public car park across the street.The family room was a little small but the kids had a great time. If we are traveling to Belfast again I will be sure to book in to the fitzwilliam . ,5,2021,08,11
226,Hen Weekend,"Excellent stay - Thank you - I will be recommending the Fitzwilliam Hotel to Friends, family and business colleagues, The location was perfect, rooms extremely comfortable and the staff could not do enough to make our weekend a special occasion.  ",5,2021,08,09
226,fab hotel,"Beautiful hotel, really comfy bed etc, will 100% stay here again, the only downside that we didn't know before going is you need to pay an extra 50¬£ deposit per night & it takes 5-7 days to go back into your account after you leave, thankfully we had the money but some might not so would be great if the hotel warned people of this before. ",5,2021,08,09
226,Superior hotel,Recharge your batteries in this luxurious hotel with friendly attentive staff.  Tasty breakfast with a lot of choice on the menu.  Efficient check in and check out with great parking service you can pay for.  Great comfortable beds and pillows.,5,2021,08,09
226,Mini bar robbery and staff,"Will not be staying here or recommend this hotel 
Basically took my ¬£50 deposit and still charged me ¬£40 something on top as I lifted things out of mini bar in room to see what there was put them back but was charged for them 
When I rang the hotel to ask what the charges were for was spoken to very rudely by a male on reception 
Was told it‚Äôs my own fault as I didn‚Äôt tell reception before I left which is absolutely absurd as they must know what was left in the mini bar when the room is cleaned and made ready for the next customer/victim of daylight robbery ",2,2021,08,06
226,NEEDS A LITTLE THINK ON PRICING,"So you pay over ¬£200 for a nights stay and you expect the hotel to be top quality but this hotel flattered you deceive.

The rooms were small and compact and the gym was just a bedroom which was annoying.

The restaurant food was ok and had to send back if you want to go for luxury go somewhere for the huge prices",3,2021,08,06
226,Fantastic hotel,"This is a beautiful hotel. Location is so central within walking distance to some lovely restaurants.  From the staff, food and our bedroom 100%. Breakfast was excellent each morning with a good selection from the buffet followed by a ready to order breakfast. I would highly recommend this hotel.",5,2021,08,04
226,short stay,good location efficient check in staff well appointed rooms clean and well maintained well organised bar and restaurant  concierge and door staff very professional and helpful giving us a great feeling of security,4,2021,08,04
226,Wonderful stay,"Excellent location and very nicely appointed rooms. Staff, especially the concierge, was exceedingly helpful. We had a small issue with the room and they solved it immediately. Overall, I would not hesitate to recommend this hotel in Belfast.",5,2021,08,03
226,Excellent location ,We stayed 2 nights and enjoyed the Fitzwilliam.  Staff are friendly and location  is excellent.  We didn't try breakfast.  Room was a good size and clean. Car parking is available opposite . Overall we enjoyed our 2 nights here and will book again ,4,2021,07,31
226,Gorgeous hotel,"Absolutely gorgeous hotel, room was so clean and staff were very so nice too. Bed was extremely comfortable and the black out curtains were brilliant!  The bar was very nice, we got an unreal pint of Guinness there and shared some food between us, the skinny fries were top notch! Very central hotel and definitely worth it!",5,2021,07,31
226,Needs a bit of work,"Hotel design is great, but the room we stayed in requires few touch-ups to get to 5-stat hotel standard.
Remotes, USB charging ports and light switches not working, damaged lamps and lamp shades all added up to not-so-perfect experience. Apart from the room state everything else was great. Maybe we were just unlucky to get it...",4,2021,07,27
226,Overnight stay,"While the room was lovely and a great nights sleep was had, the breakfast and breakfast service was a real let down, not great value for money, but then a great location with most shops and bars within walking distance ",3,2021,07,27
226,Not a 5* hotel,"Stayed here for the night last weekend. The location of the hotel is very good, but the standard of what you expect from a 5* hotel is not so. Firstly the hotel would have benefited by using lockdown to undertake general maintenance and updating. The bathroom ceiling was covered with mold, the sofa had so many stains on it, you wouldn‚Äôt risk sitting on it. There where also stains on the walls beside the bed. There is a lack of plugs and mirrors in the room and drinking water was not available. On the plus side the staff are friendly and accommodating. I‚Äôd give it 4 stars, maybe.",3,2021,07,26
226,Amazing,"We came for a friends 21st birthday, and they really just made everything so comfortable and special for her. Everything was amazing, even the concierge was so friendly! The fact that our bed was changed for us on our second day was such a a nice feeling too, not a lot of hotels do that anymore + made all the difference. ",5,2021,07,26
226,Absolutely amazing!,"We stayed in this amazing hotel for my partners birthday. I requested alot of extras which were absolutely unreal. Balloons, rose petals, chocolates, champagne. My partner was speechless when he walked into the room. Thankyou so much for everything. Breakfast was amazing and the cocktails in the bar are delicious üòçüçπ
We will definitely be back üçæ",5,2021,07,26
226,Lovely stay,"Really enjoyed our stay at the Fitzwilliam. The room was perfect for us. We made some requests for our room before we arrived, and we were not disappointed on arrival. A deposit must be paid on arrival incase you make any purchases in the hotel (breakfast etc), which we didn‚Äôt know about, but you get it back at the end of your stay. The staff were friendly and the location was perfect. Highly recommend this hotel to couples. ",5,2021,07,26
226,Chillaxing time,"Was so pleased to see the hotel was busy, some sort of normalcy! Check in was easy, wonderful receptionist. Our room was lovely, a great nights sleep on a very comfortable bed! Breakfast was excellent, everything cooked perfectly. Check out was quick and a taxi ordered to take us out to tour the Titanic experience. We will certainly be staying again at the Fitzwilliam! ",5,2021,07,25
226,Great hotel tay,"I really enjoyed this hotel stay , I don't have anything negative to say at all. It was clean in a good central location, good room amenities , comfy bed , lovely staff and we enjoyed the bar and food. If there were a couple of  improvements I would love a coffee machine in the room, and maybe the tv could be positioned better. For gluten free guests there was a small selection but they did have some really nice gluten free scones at breakfast.  All in all it's a great city centre hotel. ",5,2021,07,23
226,Excellent location but not 5 star experience,"Hotel has an excellent location. All staff were very friendly with exception of breakfast waiters. Concierge went above and beyond. We parked our car there (¬£25 per night but definitely worth it), they were happy to retrieve our car and re-park it anytime we asked. Room is lovely,  very clean and probably the best air conditioning we have ever had in any hotel room. However this is not a true 5 star hotel. Breakfast was a big let down, staff not very friendly. Pastries not fresh either morning, orange juice was straight from a carton. When I asked for freshly squeezed orange juice I was told it wasn‚Äôt possible as the hotel didn‚Äôt have any oranges!!!I was told the same when I asked for a wedge of lime at another stage. Cooked breakfast was good. 
We ate in bar one night as the restaurant wasn‚Äôt opened (this wasn‚Äôt communicated for us and I‚Äôd booked a meal in it). Food was good but steaks were very over cooked.
Bedroom had a lot of traffic noise and noise from other rooms/halls etc.",3,2021,07,22
226,Amazing,"One of the best hotels I have ever stayed in, booked again for November can‚Äôt wait to go back, the staff the rooms the food and the location are all perfect, the rooms are amazing and they meet all the criteria to be a 5star plus premium hotel in my opinion worth the money",5,2021,07,21
226,Adequately meet our needs,"I wouldn‚Äôt characterise The Fitzwilliam as five-star standard, but then neither are its prices.  I felt I‚Äôd paid the right price for what I got, which was a decent sized room in a hotel staffed by competent and helpful people.  

I decided to stay at The Fitzwilliam in preference to The Merchant Hotel and, having dined at The Merchant, I rather prefer the grandeur and elegance of that place.  The Fitzwilliam lacks the sense of occasion that you get when entering the best designed and appointed hotels ‚Äì as you enter, you‚Äôre simply presented with a small check-in area and the lifts.  The decently designed lobby area goes potentially unnoticed off to the side. 

Our room was comfortable and we slept well.  Residents who are less used to city noise should avoid rooms facing busy Grosvenor Road, which reverberates with the sounds of racing cars, sirens and drunks.

The location of The Fitzwilliam suited me as a sightseer in Belfast, wherein I travelled mostly by foot and taxi. It‚Äôs close to City Hall and some decent restaurants and bars (although the hotel bar serves up some very decent cocktails for those in need of a drink closer to their room).",4,2021,07,20
226,I night stay,Fantastic stay as always. Great staff who care about there assigned job. Food in bar was outstanding and of course the cocktails are amazing. Full credit to all the staff. Would recommend this hotel. Looking forward to next stay,5,2021,07,20
226,Great Hotel,"What more can I say ? We were well satisfied with everything. The location is very for the Europa Bus Terminal. Liked  the proximity of the Crown Public House. Front of house staff were very knowledgeable 
On places of interest.",5,2021,07,19
226,Simply THE BEST,"This hotel is one of the best I have ever had the pleasure of staying in globally!

From the minute I entered until the time I departed nothing (and I mean nothing) was too much trouble for the wonderful staff.

Room = Beautiful, Clean and Comfortable.
Foyer & Bar = Divine and Bar Staff so professional and courteous.
Frontline Staff = Friendly, welcoming and uber-professional.
Location = Excellent (12 minute taxi ride to Belfast City Airport and 5 minute walk to train station).

I did not dine in the hotel but I know it would have been as first rate as everything else.

In present times when Hospitality and all of us are struggling this hotel has maintained an excellence with a smile - Well done to you all!

Thank you The Fitzwilliam Hotel Belfast. 
",5,2021,07,19
226,Excellent,"Will definitely be staying the next time we visit. Room was spacious, staff were friendly.
The food was excellent and served promptly. Social distancing was observed at all times. Location was handy for everything.",5,2021,07,19
226,Great Hotel,"Stayed here for a long weekend, the hotel is located within walking distance of all the city centre facilities.

Booking in was a breeze, bags to room and great sized room and bathroom with both bath and separate shower. The bed was very comfy.

Concierge, Declan, was very helpful recommended and booked a table at a local restaurant, which was great,

The bar was good, as was the service.

Overall had a great stay and will stay again.",5,2021,07,19
226,Amazing Hotel,Amazing Hotel and lovely staff nice to be in the centre of Belfast but away from the night hustle and bustle 100% recommend always felt safe in the current times and staff were more than happy to help whenever you needed them can't wait to go back,5,2021,07,19
226,Brilliant stay ,"Myself and my husband stayed for our anniversary.  Staff were very friendly and helpful. Room very clean, modern and tastefully decorated. We received a lovely dessert and card from the hotel which was waiting in our room. Bar very nice. Breakfast was continental buffet style (self service) and cooked breakfast/Pancakes made fresh to order. Weekend breakfast is 7ish - 11 which was ideal for a lie on. Time slot for breakfast booked upon check in. Check out was 12 which again was much appreciated so morning could be enjoyed. Felt extremely covid safe. Thanks for a lovely stay.",5,2021,07,18
226,Superb stay,We thoroughly enjoyed our stay at the luxurious Fitzwilliam. The attention to detail overall is very evident. Our room was beautiful.  We are very much looking forward to a return visit later in the year. ,5,2021,07,18
226,Perfect in every way,The hotel was everything it is said to be I could not have a single complaint about any part of my stay. Rooms were amazing clean and luxurious and my extra add ons were accompanied by a hand written birthday card for my girlfriend which was a lovely touch,5,2021,07,18
226,Belfast's FINEST,"Wonderful experience.
Staff friendly, welcoming, efficient and professional. 
Beautiful room, en-suite.
Hotel foyer and bar are gorgeous.
Centrally located for sightseeing. Train station around the corner.
Belfast City Airport is a 12 minute taxi drive away ",5,2021,07,18
226,Good 4* Hotel lacking the detail of a 5*,"Stayed in one of the hotels suites and for the price they were good, although they were definitely not 5* luxury more like a good 4*. The room itself was fine, it had everything you could ask for although it was not the cleanest with cup marks all over the furniture and dust on a number of surfaces. The room also had some damage that would‚Äôve been easily fixed such as a light switch being broken off and the in room tablet not working. My biggest let down was the lack of communication from staff upon check in as I required room service and so when I got to my room I rang the room service number multiple times with no answer and so I tried reception just to be informed that the restaurant was closed and I had to ring the bar, this should not happen in a 5* hotel under any circumstances, this should‚Äôve been communicated at check in. It is a lovely hotel but it needs to up its game and more importantly its attention to detail.",4,2021,07,15
226,One night break,Lovely hotel and decor rooms spacious with all that you need including  little extras loved the fitzwilliam umbrella available to buy. The bed was so comfortable had a great night's sleep. Especially loved the bar and restaurant food and service where excellent. When checking in and out staff where very friendly. ,5,2021,07,15
226,This hotel has everything 5*,"Fabulous from start to finish, luxurious feel, fantastic customer service, and the restaurant was out of this world, with delicious breakfast options and evening meal, location was perfect easy walk to shops and restaurants.",5,2021,07,12
226,Zero Sleep,"Stayed for my birthday, staff were friendly in general, although some don‚Äôt listen very well when making basic queries. Excellent location and convenient car park beside the hotel at discounted rate for guests. Food was not 5 star hotel standard, frozen pizza for example. Worst part was trying to sleep, room 310 was located roadside, every time I was close to nodding off I was startled by police sirens, motorbike engines or car horns. I‚Äôm giving 4 stars because I enjoyed my stay but left disappointed and extremely tired, I didn‚Äôt even bother eating breakfast because I wanted to get home to get some sleep....",4,2021,07,12
226,First trip away,"Great staff and food fantastic. Very covid safe. Great location. Little paint jobs could be done in rooms to cover marks or chips on door. Reasonably priced for drinks. Stopped making cocktails a bit too early. Service from staff prompt and friendly. Would definitely recommend as lovely, relaxing break away.",5,2021,07,10
226,"Fabulous Hotel, excellent customer service",Great location. Staff are super friendly and extremely helpful. Hotel rooms are gorgeous and really clean. Food was delicious in the bar. We are really looking forward to returning to the Fitzwilliam Hotel.,5,2021,07,10
226,Great location but that does mean some road noise,"This is a very good hotel in a great central location. It is a bit tricky to park and unload as there is no real pull in entrance area.  Friendly and helpful staff, good size room (exec king) but bed a touch hard but that is a personal taste issue. Great breakfast, probably the best I have had.  The only real down side is road noise which did interrupt my sleep quite a bit so see if you can get a higher room or one that is over looking a quieter area do so.  ",4,2021,07,10
226,Lovely Hotel,We were looked after very well from arrival to departure. Service was very good. Our room was comfortable. Food was very good but we would have like more choice on the menu. Staff all provided good service.,5,2021,07,09
226,Super trip in a beautiful hotel,"Couldn‚Äôt recommend this hotel highly enough. Book parking in the Super value car park across the road. The staff went above and beyond and I will definitely return. The food, the room were amazing and for such a good price.",5,2021,07,08
226,Great experience,Stayed in this hotel before every time excellent service and very friendly and helpful staff. Great location near shops and restaurants.

226,A very nice hotel in a good central location.,"As the title says. What is not to like about the Fitzwilliam. A good central location, very nice staff, lovely rooms, really nice food, and in the bar very reasonable prices. If you are heading to Belfast, this is definitely worth staying in.",5,2021,07,06
226,Great hotel tho need to push more on the finer details around rooms,Hotel was fantastic and people and the overall experience was great tho the finer details like the suite pad working and making sure that the room is spotless before guests arrive needs to be addressed. I think that it‚Äôs the finer details that leaves the lasting impression on the whole experience  ,4,2021,07,05
226,Best hotel in belfast,"Absolutely stunning hotel, for price and quality of hotel out strips any other in Belfast. Great location as well easy to get to many locations through out the city, with parking extremely close. Staff friendly and always very attentive. Great place ",5,2021,07,05

226,Perfect,Stay was perfect couldn‚Äôt fault it one bit from staff to rooms and to the food was all exceptional. Would highly recommend and will definitely be returning again in the near future. Perfect area for city centre shopping ,5,2021,07,04
226,Well worth the visit.,"The staff were very pleasant and welcoming. Didn‚Äôt pressurise us as we ate. We had the crafternoon tea, yes, crafternoon, as tea replaced by craft beers, and it was excellent. So different from scones and sandwiches. Would definitely recommend a visit to here. No need to call anywhere after to get something to eat as very filling.",5,2021,07,04

226,Hidden gem in the city!,"Fabulous hotel, friendly and professional staff! 

Conceirge, front desk & housekeeping team are superb! 

The standard twin room is quite small for our liking. 

Overall, we had a great time and we look forward returning in December!",5,2021,07,04
226,Poor Dining room Service,"Its been 4 years since we last visited The Fitzwilliam Hotel and it will be many more before we come back. 
The service in the dining room is absolutely unacceptable 40 minutes for a breakfast to come and during Covid thats only get 1 course .
My son and daughter in law got us this gift for my birthday .
What a disappointment üò¢",3,2021,07,03
226,Disappointing stay,"Stayed here for 3 nights, very disappointing stay, the room was a nice size however the sheets were stained the staff were not very friendly or approachable so we didn‚Äôt mention the stained sheets , ate in the bar one night and the bar menu has very little options to chose from, approached reception to ask about the bar before we ate there and have to say they were rude. Won‚Äôt be staying again",1,2021,07,03
226,Fab stay,"Had a fab stay in this lovely hotel. Staying for the one night celebrating our wedding anniversary. Room was spotless with plenty of room. All staff from reception and restaurant were excellent,  very efficient. Had a great offer of stay and 2 course evening meal,  super,  food was brill. Would def recommend. ",5,2021,07,03
226,New 1st choice for Belfast,"1st time staying in the Fitzwilliam but won‚Äôt be the last. We usually stay in Belfast 6 or 7 times  a year for various reasons, this one was for our anniversary. Lovely room,fantastic food, service was great and location couldn‚Äôt be better. We will be making this our 1st choice from now on.",5,2021,07,02
226,Lovely quality with Irish friendliness,"This hotel offers Irish friendliness and hospitality with a dose of trendy luxury. The rooms are decorated in black and white and mirrored finishes, the beds are comfortable and the concierge is friendly and helpful with your requests. Thankyou for a great stay. There are a few bars and restaurants within walking distance. I would also recommend a tour of Belfast whilst you are there.",5,2021,07,02
226,Short stay,"Well positioned quality hotel with friendly helpful staff. Breakfast is good value for money having a wide range of foodstuffs.
Friendly bar. Hotel close to city centre with several good restaurants within walking distance ",5,2021,07,01
226,5 stars it‚Äôs not.,This Hotel was punching above his weight as advertised as a five star hotel as the welcome and the quality of the room - bar service certainly not five-star that‚Äôs a good four-star hotel and I wound have been happy if I have a paid a four-star price. ,3,2021,06,29
226,Excellent,"We were checked in by Shannon who was very friendly and professional. We were served cocktails in the bar by Brian, who was the perfect host. Brian greeted us immediately and took our drinks order, he made us two wonderful cocktails. He was attentive, approachable and very professional. Breakfast in the morning was the same high standards. We were greeted immediately and immediately brought to a table fully set and waiting for us. The lady that greeted us (I unfortunately forgot to take a note of her name) explained the huge selection of continental breakfast and hot food available and took our tea and coffee order, which arrived within seconds. Coffee was hot and strong, there was a selection of herbal teas available. Cara and Chloe and the rest of the breakfast staff were very well organised and efficient. We were able to place an order for hot food very quickly, which took maybe 5 minutes to reach our table hot and delicious. All staff wore PPE. Service throughout the hotel was consistently efficient, professional and quick, we were never waiting. 

Our room was comfortable and stylish and spotlessly clean. The bed was huge and comfortable, the shower was big and had excellent water pressure. There was adjustable air conditioning and heating in the room.

The concierge looked after our bags after check out while we went shopping in city centre. The location is ideal for exploring the city on foot.",5,2021,06,29
226,Wonderful stay,"Really enjoyed our night in the FitzWilliam. We had a room with a view and it was fantastic waking up to a view of the Belfast skyline and cave hill mountains. The room itself was exceptional little touches really made us feel this was a 5*  hotel. Very central. Service was fantastic, wide selection at breakfast but would recommend going down early. Will absolutely return",5,2021,06,29
226,Overnight shopping trip,Stayed on Saturdayeven and expected to drop of our bags and head out. Instead to our surprise our room was ready and we were able to freshen up. Every member of staff were extremely friendly and could not have done enough for us. Only one blip the loo flush was broken and dislodged from the wall so this was awkward. Aside this a fantastic stay and I will definitely be back. Could not fault the food and cocktails.,5,2021,06,28
226,Outstanding!,"Fabulous 3 night stay.Stunning hotel.Staff outstanding - despite wearing masks they were friendly, warm and engaging.Bedroom on 7th floor was amazing!Food in restaurant delicious!Bar was great.Car park fee across road (value) was discounted by concierge.Only minor thing - we would have liked fresh milk not UHT in fridge.But room service arranged this for our tea until we got to the shop. Thank you for such a fantastic stay! ",5,2021,06,28
226,Holiday,"On arrival a no fuss early book in was arranged. 
The little touches of having music playing for us entering the room was a lovely touch.
Irish breakfast tea and filter coffee were little touches that were greatly appreciated. 
Staff were fabulous across the board and the genuineness of their guest enjoyment was truly wonderful. ",5,2021,06,27
226,"Lovely hotel, good restaurant","Very chic hotel, lovely restaurant food, very accommodating staff, thanks leanne for a lovely stay. We will be back soon, the rooms are spacious and full of everything you need, close to the centre so it's handy for bar hopping.",5,2021,06,25
226,Great to be back,"Our third stay at the Fitzwilliam - their very high standard for accommodation, food and drink continues. My husband and I enjoyed our one night break on 22nd June (Fitz Time to Escape offer - breakfast with 2 course dinner) very much. Lovely staff. room was clean, great choices on menus for dinner and breakfast. Highly recommend.",5,2021,06,24
226,Super Stay. ,"A genuinely lovely stay. A very accommodating concierge sent us on our way early afternoon and a gorgeous room greeted us on our return. Covid takes away from the modern 5 star hotel bar set up but table service was good and prompt.

The room itself was very, very good. A little birthday cake awaited us which was a lovely touch. Breakfast was lovely, seated quickly and very delicious.

Would highly recommend, and will stay again. ",4,2021,06,20
226,Great hotel,"From our arrival,pretty much everything was spot on.the hotel staff were friendly and knowledgeable and the steak meal we had in the restaurant was beautiful. The rooms were spacious and well equipped with everything you need.We would definitely stay here again.",4,2021,06,20
226,Lovely Hotel,"Upon arriving here at the end of our Strangford Lough bicycle tour we had a warm welcoming greeting from Philip, the Concierge,who kindly put our bikes safely away.  He was very informative, told us places to visit, things to do. Beautifully decorated rooms, with city view.   Very friendly and helpful staff.  Great breakfast.  A good place to stay when in Belfast. Hope to come back to this hotel for a weekend city break.",5,2021,06,17
226,Hotel stay,"Excellent stay, excellent service and an excellent experience in a great location and a great trip. Really enjoyed the food and the hotel was spotless and easy to get around. Really comfortable from the time I arrived. ",5,2021,06,14
226,5 Star Hotel that is lacking,"There was no customer service with in this 5 Star hotel, please don‚Äôt blame it on Covid‚Ä¶. This is certainly not a bad hotel but i wouldn‚Äôt considered it a 5 Star experience at all. The room was decent. Will I come back again, probably try a different hotel instead.",2,2021,06,09
226,Second Time staying *Valet *room type,"*request a City/street view at the front of the hotel - rooms are bigger
We checked in on a uk Bank Holiday Monday.
We previously stayed in an Executive King room 504 at this hotel and loved the room so booked the same type. 
This time we were given room 810, which seemed much smaller and faced onto the generators etc of the building. 
We took to the website and it looked like we were given a signature room rather than an executive. 
The wardrobes are just inside the door in a very narrow walkway towards the bedroom, and I caught my toe under the door when I opened it. 
I can be a bit claustrophobic when we have luggage and everything in a small room so I‚Äôd have never chosen such a compact room.  
There was also too much furniture in this room, two small coffee tables each side of the sofa, a dressing table/desk, two bedside lockers, and an additional table that houses the kettle/coffee. 
There was also a big spillage on the carpet. 
We were too tired to complain and we only got married the day before so we wanted to sleep and keep the trip positive. 
Also because it was a bank holiday, we knew the chances of a room change were slim. 
The next day (Tuesday) I spoke to reception to ask if we were in the correct room type, she said we were and that they were exactly the same size. 
I said ok and advised that I had stayed in this room type before and it just seemed much smaller in comparison. 
The lovely receptionist asked me to leave it with her, told me what time she finished work and asked me to come back to her before then. We did and we were given room 506 which was exactly the room type we stayed in previously.  She was very helpful and we were delighted.
*Valet parking - Don‚Äôt expect a clean exterior on it‚Äôs return 
The concierge were brilliant and so helpful, we couldn‚Äôt fault them at all! 
However we parked our car with the hotel - ¬£25 a night, we  stayed for 4 nights so it‚Äôs not cheap. 
We had gotten our car valeted inside and out before our trip so it was so clean on arrival, and when we got it back there was so much bird poop all over it! 
For this reason alone I‚Äôd arrange the garage parking across from the hotel, at least your car would be covered in and not open to being destroyed by bird poop. 

Other than that, we couldn‚Äôt fault the hotel. The bar restaurant food was lovely, it doesn‚Äôt open until 4pm or 5pm, but we seen other guests ordering food to the lobby area. 
Hotel was spotlessly clean and had Fresh floral arrangements in the lobby. 
Location is brilliant, it‚Äôs Attached to the opera house.",3,2021,06,09
226,Hotel,Me and my partner had a fantastic time in the Fitzwilliam . The staff were amazing nothing was a issue and very helpful . Extra shout out to the 2 girls at reception witch am sorry I forgot there names and we can't leave Philip out who looked after us . I'll definitely be returning to Fitzwilliam .. Thank u so much,5,2021,06,09

226,Great hotel worth a visit,"Great hotel 5 star , ideally located nice rooms and food is excellent , highly recommend Take a black taxi tour , our tour guide was Steplen and spent a lot of time with us ! If your coming to Belfast don‚Äôt look at any other hotel . This hotel is 5 star all the way !",5,2021,06,08
226,Amazing,I thoroughly enjoyed my stay here. Gorgeous hotel with the nicest staff!!! I will definitely be coming back!!! The cocktails were amazing and such good value. The staff were amazing!!! Room was fabulous!!!!!,5,2021,06,08
226,Hotel review,"Great stay really friendly staff
Door man was very friendly 
Food in the restaurant top quality 
Really clean,spacious and comfortable room
Will definitely stay here again 
Nicest hotel I have stayed in a long time",5,2021,06,07
226,Not 5 Star,If you like 5 star do not stay here. Nothing about this hotel is 5 star I have no idea how it has 5 stars. Service is poor the hotel itself needs a complete refurbishment. The breakfast and restaurant room are the same which is really disappointing. We were really looking forward to staying here but we won't be back. ,3,2021,06,07
226,"A great stay, amazing staff and perfect location","We stayed here for 2 nights in June 2021 - brilliant location, great bar, lovely room (awesome shower) and amazing staff ‚Ä¶ nothing was too much trouble, we will be returning and would definitely recommend !

Covid procedures in place, we felt safe and protected.",5,2021,06,07
226,"Used to be good, but has TOTALLY lost its sheen","Upon arrival, a newer reception member was talking to her colleague about how to allocate a room number as she said there were multiple rooms with my category available.  The colleague whispered something and I ended up in an a very small category room beside the lift shaft. I have stayed at the hotel multiple times so I knew it was inferior. I complained and was moved to an appropriate category room type. The hotel experience was far inferior than before. The bed was extremely uncomfortable and I could feel springs in my back. The housekeeping was, at best, cursory and they didn‚Äôt even take away a chocolate wrapper from the bed, and just covered it with the duvet; dirty glasses weren‚Äôt cleared and it felt half hearted. Went to breakfast at 7.15am on Sunday and the buffet hadn‚Äôt been set up. As orange juice hadn‚Äôt been set up, I asked for a glass but it never arrived. When my pancakes arrived I asked for more maple syrup, but it never arrived. I asked for toast and it never arrived. There was NOONE else in the restaurant!!  The Fitzwilliam has rested on its laurels and is not worth the extortionate amount it charges. It would take a lot for me to consider going back. ",1,2021,06,07
226,Disappointing,"Certainly did not feel like a five star hotel, room in much need of a bit of maintenance, sink cracked and chipped, stains on carpet, spotlight not working , part of shower door coming away. On a positive note all staff were very friendly, food was grand and service in bar and restaurant excellent. We have stayed in four star hotels in Belfast that were less expensive and better quality.",3,2021,06,06
226,Nice hotel BUT not 5 star,"Nice hotel but lacked 5 star status. Rooms were nicely decorated but few minor issues, no pods for coffee machine, no coffee for cafitiere no complimentary water provided. It's the small things that make 5 star..... however fab shower and lovely breakfast. ",4,2021,06,06
226,Excellent overnight stay,"Good value, well located, efficient staff, updated rooms and excellent bathrooms.
Breakfast was great with prompt service and excellent coffee.
I requested an early check in and this got into my room at noon, which was great!",5,2021,06,05
226,Brilliant Hotel great friendly and welcoming staff,Brilliant stay in the Fitzwilliam hotel. Centrally located near the centre of Belfast. Able to walk easily around the city. From checkin to check out the staff were brilliant.  Breakfast each morning very good. Rooms very comfortable and clean. Was very C19 compliant but was great to be back in bars and restaurants again. Will stay againif ever in Belfast ,5,2021,06,04
226,Outstanding stay at Fitzwilliam hotel,"Fantastic 3 night stay at Fitzwilliam Hotel.  Everything we experienced was top class but special mention to a great welcome and efficient check in and an outstanding effort by the breakfast team. A1 also to the housekeeping  also.
The hotel location is perfect if travelling from the south, the motorway exit is about 60 seconds from the hotel. A five minute walk takes you right into the middle of Belfast. 
Cannot recommend this hotel enough.  ",5,2021,06,03
226,Family Getaway,"This was our first time staying in The Fitzwilliam Hotel. 

The staff were all so friendly. The hotel itself was so nice, rooms were beautiful and very comfortable for families. 

We had the steak option in the restaurant and I would rate it 10/10. We will definitely stay again when back in Belfast. 

Excellent all around. Well deserving 5*",5,2021,06,01
226,Short & sweet trip!,"Grabbed a very quick night away , we have stayed here before, and hotel was fab as always. The staff were so friendly and welcoming. Our starters were fab, had a few issues with our mains, but nothing drastic, and in fairness, it was their 1st wk end back after Covid lockdown. Breakfast was utterly delicious..... best I‚Äôve had in so long. We will definitely be back.  Hope the reopening goes smoothly guys. ü•∞",4,2021,06,01
226,10/10 would recommend to a friend!,"Excellent all around, I would definitely attend this hotel again. Efficient and friendly staff, impeccable rooms and there was a eccentric vibe all over the hotel. The price is worth is totally in regards to the service provided. ",5,2021,05,31
226,Wedding anniversary stay,So I had booked the fitzwilliam as  a surprise for my wife as it was our wedding anniversary. It was amazing we stayed in a deluxe junior suite. From checking in early are room was ready it was on room 602 on the corner of the building with amazing views (look at my pics). With the package I booked dinner and breakfast was included. We had a few drinks in the bar to start with and even with the restrictions and needing to be seated the staff were so accommodating. When we went up for are dinner reservation it was noticeable they where running behind. When we eventually got seated they brought us prosecco and where very apologetic for the delay are food was amazing it tasted so good. As for breakfast again the food and service was brilliant. In total we had an amazing stay and would like to thank every member of staff for there care and attention during our stay,5,2021,05,31
226,Another great stay!,I stayed in the Fitzwilliam on the 29th of May 2021. All of the staff were as polite and helpful as always. I felt very safe as all the staff members were wearing masks and there were perspex screens between the staff and guests in reception. The cocktails in the bar were delicious. I highly recommend the pear drop. The tables in the bar were thoroughly cleaned between guests. One of the friendly concierges carried our luggage to our room for us but I didn't get his name. Our bedroom was well decorated and looked very clean. This is my favourite hotel in Northern Ireland and I always look forward to going back!,5,2021,05,30
226,Exceptional,"The room (and view) were exceptional for the price we paid. I was very impressed upon arrival. Staff were nice, especially Mairead in the bar. The only thing I would say is the staff be more specific; we were told every hour after checkout (12pm) we would be charged ¬£10 per hour for added time. However, it would‚Äôve been nice to know 3pm would be the latest we could stay. Also, light sleepers may have issues as there is a lot of noise pollution outside eg sirens. Overall, I had a really good stay and enjoyed it.",4,2021,05,26
226,Hotel stay,"I couldn‚Äôt fault this stay. We waited nearly 4 months with restrictions. Upon arrival greeting by staff taking away our car to park, quick check in. Amazing room with great view over Belfast. Loved the fact they went to the extra effort and put a happy birthday card and cake for my boyfriend. The food and drinks at the bar was a 10/10- easily one of the best tasting meals but also relaxing dinners I have had. As someone who works in healthcare I found the cleaning staff to be very attentive and the hotel fitted with sanitiser throughout- I felt at ease. I can‚Äôt thank the whole team for their welcoming and attentive staff- we will be back soon! I never normally write reviews but I had to because i couldn‚Äôt fault your service and because I enjoyed it so much ",5,2021,05,26
226,Not 5 Star Quality,"During our recent stay at the Fitzwilliam hotel, we were left disappointed by the service provided by staff. Myself and my fianc√© upon exiting the car park were told by a staff member that he was waiting on us so that he could close the gate. Despite both me and my fianc√© having two bags each and also clothing items in hand, the staff member did not offer take care of our luggage. He followed us into the hotel without saying a word until we reached the entrance of the hotel before he said the door is open.

Following check in, again staff did not offer to take care of our luggage. 

Although the food from the in door menu was excellent and the room moderate and clean, this was not a five star hotel experience. When booking hotels in the future we will not be considering Fitzwilliam hotel for our stay. ",2,2021,05,10
226,Lockdown Visit - Business Trip - Key Activities,"Normally a hotel of this calibre is not within budget, but for due to lockdown I think it was. I wanted to say a massive thankyou to all staff during the visit during these challenging times. especially creating a reservation last minute due to failing with our automated booking systems. 
Due to lockdown there was no restaurant or bar  but the breakfast was fantastic. ",5,2021,02,25
226,Unrivalled in Belfast,Absolutely loved my stay at The Fitzwilliam hotel.  Staff were excellent.  Rooms were very well designed with an extremely comfortable bed. Room service was prompt.  Everything is exactly as you would expect of a high quality hotel.  Would highly recommend.,5,2021,01,13
226,Business & leisure,"The hotel itself was fab unfortunately the service and friendliness was a huge let down. The room was beautiful and very clean. The bath was fab. The location in Belfast was terrific just a short walk from the main shopping area, bars and restaurants.",2,2021,01,02
226,First time stay... will be back,"Covid aside we had a great experience.  Very friendly staff and went above and beyond for us.  

Breakfast was amazing and.we the staff took time to talk to you.  

Will stay again and throughly deserving of a five star rating ",5,2020,12,21
226,Fantastic stay,"Fantastic stay, with warm and welcoming staff who couldn‚Äôt be more helpful. Modern rooms and building in a great location to Belfast City Centre. We look forward to staying again soon, and would definitely recommend. ",5,2020,12,21
226,First Class!,"We had a lovely stay. All the staff are friendly and efficient. The room was spotlessly clean and nice and cool. Breakfast menu has a great choice, especially for vegetarians and the produce is top quality. We will definitely return! ",5,2020,12,20
226,Great experience,"We stayed for 1 night. Had an amazing view of the city and mountains.
The room was modern, beautifully decorated. 
I wish the windows were clean, the view would have been much better in that case. 
Overall, the hotel is beautiful, recommended! ",5,2020,12,17
226,Birthday celebration/ Amazing,"I booked here to celebrate my husbands birthday and it was amazing, I had arranged a few days before for a Cake to be brought out after dinner and the staff couldn‚Äôt have been anymore helpful, the food was beautiful and the service was impeccable. It was the first weekend after the lockdown so we were a little nervous but they‚Äôre covid policies, social distance, and wearing off mask was excellent, every staff member adhered all the rules whilst still being so pleasant.

Returning in the new year.",5,2020,12,17
226,Great Hotel great service,"First time in Belfast, and lovely hotel. Service from the moment we enterted to when we left was excellent, lovely comfy room, delicious breakfast, great staff. Only fly in the ointment was that if you have an early flight back Breakfast doesn't start till 7am, so you don't get any!",4,2020,12,16
226,Overpriced for what it is.,"A veneer of class, but everything is old and starting to fall apart. My toilet flush button fell into the wall, the thermostats are ancient and make no sense (no numbers, just a smiley face in the middle of the dial, but the dial spins around and around, so you are never sure if it is on heating or AC...). In addition they double charged me for room service, which is just annoying and not a mistake I would expect at an upscale place.",2,2020,12,13
226,A grand place to stay!,"Came to stay at The Fitzwilliam Hotel in Belfast for a short break with my family,
First time in Ireland so wasn‚Äôt sure what to expect.
I needn‚Äôt have worried as everyone was super friendly from the time we arrived at the airport til it was time to leave.
The staff at The Fitzwillam were no exception, everyone was so friendly and helpful,
We had booked two executive double rooms which were lovely and spacious and spotlessly clean and refreshed every day to an extremely high standard!
Sent an email ahead of time to ask the hotel if they could do anything to surprise our youngest son as we were arriving on his 16th Birthday.
They provided a chocolate decorated slate with a small cake & macaron & a personalised card with his name on at no cost,he was well chuffed!
Hotel is right in the heart of the city and within walking distance of most things.
The only gripe I had was the cost of breakfast which was ¬£20 per head per day which I consider to be at the upper end of the scale & whilst the continental buffet was great, the cooked breakfast was not so much, while the scrambled eggs were fresh made and hot, the sausage, bacon, black pudd & sausage meat slice were not and I thought had been kept warm for some time which for that price is not acceptable really!
We had dinner in the restaurant one evening and it was excellent!
All in all, I can‚Äôt wait to come back to Belfast and The Fitzwilliam Hotel once Covid restrictions are lifted and can heartily recommend it!",4,2020,10,19
226,"Great hotel, but car parking charge too expensive","Visited the hotel in September 2020, pleasant welcome, lovely hotel, particularly the funky lobby. Covid 19 compliance very much in evidence all over the hotel, so felt safe in the midst of pandemic. Nice location for local restaurants which were plentiful, walking to city centre, or walking to the Queen's University area. Lots to do, hotel was very informative about our queries, and they even supply a good umbrella (it's the little things....). The bedroom had a decent chain for locking - not found in many places-  but it really added to our feeling of security. The breakfasts were the highlight of the stay, beautiful food, again with great Covid 19 restriction compliance, and a very pleasant waitress on both days. The only downside of our stay was the expensive valet parking - ¬£25 per night. Would I return? While the hotel was lovely, it is very expensive, but the ""deal breaker"" is the cost of parking. I have been to the city and stayed in other good hotels previously (not all 5 star) but, being honest, for me the parking cost is too expensive on top of the accommodation price. We're more likely to book elsewhere in the future. Sorry!",4,2020,10,16
226,Fabulous hotel,"First visit to Belfast from Scotland and couldn‚Äôt have chosen a better hotel. Staff were very friendly and the hotel is beautiful. It was our wedding anniversary and staff had placed a card and lovely cakes in the room, lovely touch, much appreciated. Our room was fabulous, modern, spacious, clean and very quiet. The breakfast was amazing definitely worth having. Would definitely stay again if we returned to Belfast.",5,2020,10,15
226,Afternoon Tea at Fitzwilliam,We had such a lovely Afternoon Tea at the Fitzwilliam. Anna who looked after us was just wonderful and couldn't do enough for us! Fantastic service and wonderful and filling food. Would highly recommend!,5,2020,10,10
226,Weekend Stay for Wedding,"Excellent hotel, the staff at the Fitzwilliam were absolutely brilliant and went out of their way to make our stay as comfortable and enjoyable as possible. Our wedding guests who stayed at the hotel all gave similar feedback and would thoroughly recommend the hotel.",5,2020,10,07
226,Amazing Fitzwilliam Hotel,Gorgeous hotel. We stayed in the Residence Suite with beatiful views over Belfast.  Very friendly staff.  Every member of staff from doormen to chambermaids were courteous and friendly.  Amazing breakfast.  Highly recommend this central hotel and will definitely return.,5,2020,10,05
226,Perfection in Belfast,"I have stayed in a few hotels in Belfast over the past few months and The Fitzwilliam surpasses all of them. From the warm welcome at Reception to the standard of the rooms.  I arrived at the hotel at 12pm (Check in is 3pm) and it was no problem at all.  I was told my room was ready and I could check in immediately.  The girl on reception was so nice and friendly.  Got to my room (404) and it was stunning.  Huge bed and the bathroom was to die for.  Large deep bath and the attention to detail was exemplary.  Beautiful toiletries and there was even an little candle and box of brand matches by the bath.  Umbrella in your room incase its raining outside.  I was very impressed with the little details.  I had breakfast delivered to my room in the morning and it was so tasty.  It was nice to be able to eat in private in my own room as I was a solo traveller.  There is an extra tray charge for this but well worth it,  The Fitzwilliam will now be my hotel of choice when I visit Belfast.",5,2020,10,02
226,Lovely hotel ,"Had two nights here with my wife earlier this week. Really courteous front-of-house staff and concierge. Nice rooms, good cocktail bar and food. I‚Äôd say it‚Äôs a wonderful 4* hotel but falls short of other 5* hotels we‚Äôve stayed at. ",4,2020,09,30
226,Showing it‚Äôs age,"Stayed here for one night during our staycation travelling around the Provence. We stayed in nice hotels on our trips including the Slieve Donard and Lough Erne resort which are also 5 star. Must say the Fitzwilliam is more 3 star in comparison! Having stayed here a number of years ago I was looking forward to our nice executive room, robe and slippers and relaxing. Unfortunately there were no robe and slippers, I assume due to Covid, but again all the other hotels were able to provide them. The bathroom was grubby and tiles were chipped off the walls. 

It was certainly nothing special and I will stick to the Europa where we normally stay in the city which is far superior than this. ",3,2020,09,29
226,Fitzwilliam,Came back again in September after a lovely stay in August. Covid or not you can't beat the fitz . Relaxing enjoyable and safe.   Big thank you to Chris who continues to serve first class engaging service with charm and proffessionalism. Definitely on our list of places to revisit,5,2020,09,28
226,Luxury in the heart of Belfast,"We booked the celebration package in one of the junior deluxe suites and it was out of this world. The room was stunning , with great views and the hotel is spotlessly clean. The staff are all so friendly and nothing is too much trouble. All social distancing measures were observed and we felt very safe staying there.
We had our evening meal in the restaurant and every course was delicious. 
We definitely recommend it and we will be back.",5,2020,09,27
226,"Brilliant stay, top notch","We were here for three nights visiting the city.

Everything about the hotel was superb.

The location is great, the service from everyone was first class.

The approach to COVID was very sensible and pragmatic, unlike many hotels we stayed at on our trip.

Breakfast was very well managed. A selection of self select and cook to order.

The bar food was good value.

Car parking was very well managed.

Our room was serviced daily with no fuss or restrictions.

Amazingly this was one of the cheapest hotels we booked on a 3 week trip and we got fantastic 5 star service.

There is nothing to find fault with at all, it was wonderful.",5,2020,09,27
226,Number 1 place to stay in Belfast,"Luxurious, friendly and welcoming. Great food and friendly helpful staff. Would definitely here again. Good sized rooms and very comfortable bed. Great tea tray and good quality coffee. Enjoyed dinner our first evening there. Food excellent and service outstanding. Great cocktails and staff very attentive. Breakfast next morning was just as good. Left our luggage in the hotel after check out to go shopping. Great location. Close to shops and the city hall.",5,2020,09,26
226,Definitely recommend - great location,"We booked this hotel for two nights and added on an extra night while we were there as we were enjoying the city so much. 
It's more of a boutique hotel as the communal areas are small, but it didn't take from the high standards of cleanliness and the elegant decor. 
We did not add breakfast, but if you do add it to your stay it has to be booked the day before due to covid restrictions.  We had a drink in the bar/restaurant before we headed elsewhere for dinner, but the bar/restaurant was always busy in the evening which is a sign that the food is good and it also had to be reserved in advance.  The lobby area was so cozy with the fire lighting and comfortable chairs.  We booked our car in with the hotel Valet out of convenience and paid ¬£25 per night.  The concierge and all the reception staff were so friendly and helpful.  
Our room was beautiful! It was very clean and modern with lots of space & storage. There were also a lot of mirrors including one on the bathroom door for full length view of your ""going out outfit"" which I thought was great as most hotels only have the odd mirror and can be frustrating when getting ready for a nice meal or night out.  The bed was huge, and comfortable and very nicely dressed.  The only downfall with the room was the heat, we had a warm few days in Belfast and at night even with Air-con it was difficult to sleep and it was so stuffy and hot.  
The bathroom was lovely and well stocked with essentials, but the shower hadn't got great pressure. There was a shower hose in the bathtub that had great pressure, but unfortunately there was nothing to hold this up and I presume it is only for rinsing yourself, the tub down after use.   There was a tealight and candle provided with the daily essentials for relaxing in the tub! And they also provided hand sanitizer which smelt lovely. 
The location was brilliant, very close to a nice restaurant for breakfast called flame, and directly across from a centra.  It was only a couple of minutes walk to Victoria square area and around a 12-15 minute walk to Cathedral quarter.
Although it was in the very centre of the city and the streets were always busy, there was no outside noise heard at all within our room so if you're a light sleeper you wont be effected by outside noise.
The only negative I have is that there were no slippers our housecoats provided even though it tells you online that these are provided in the rooms.  I'm not sure if this is due to Covid, but we were not made aware of it at check in or prior to check in.  It meant we had no footwear with us for when we got out of the shower. I personally don't like walking barefoot on hotel room carpet for hygiene reasons, and i like getting the housecoats in hotels as I find hotel towels are always quite small.  If I had been advised of this prior to travel,  I'd have brought my own slippers/housecoat.  Having these items provided is one of the reason I always book higher standard hotels so it was a disappointment.
The room also has a safe, a hairdryer, an Ironing Board and Iron.
Overall though, we had a great experience and would go back to Belfast to stay in this hotel in a heartbeat!",5,2020,09,26
226,my husband's birthday,"I always love belfast but this was the first time I stayed in the Fitzwilliam Hotel. It was fabulous. The location was excellent, everything was walking distance, we parked our car in value car parks, across the road. We stayed for my husband's birthday and the hotel left a little card and chocolate in the room, which was a lovely touch. The room is fantastic, exactly like on online. Which is often not the case in other hotels. There were lovely touches like umbrellas to use if needed, a shower and a bath in the bathroom etc. The room was spotless. The breakfast was delicious, top quality food and the staff were very friendly and curtious. Thank you for a wonderful stay. We will def visit again. üòä",5,2020,09,23
226,Amazing hotel!,"Hotel was spotless clean, so modern and stylish! The location is perfect right in the middle of everything! Staff all so friendly and helpful. Only 1 thing is bar and reception are small so arrive early to get a table for a drink to avoid disappointmentüòä",5,2020,09,22
226,Excellent Hotel - Great Staff,"Stayed 3 nights for a city break with friends. 

The rooms are excellent and the staff were brilliant. 

Had breakfast in our room one morning and it was phenomenal. 

We will definitely be back to Belfast and if we do, we will certainly stay at the Fitzwilliam again!",5,2020,09,16
226,Weekend away,"Fabulous hotel,really enjoyed our stay,couldn't fault it,room was amazing,so comfortable and they had every detail covered right down to an umbrella,i will definitely be back to Belfast and the Fitzwilliam will be my first choice",5,2020,09,14
226,Lovely hotel,"Returned to stay for a night whilst in Belfast.  Lovely hotel, very clean and very friendly staff.  Rooms are very spacious and designed very well.  Very clean hotel and central for accessing the city.  Lovely bar and restaurant. Staff were very helpful.",5,2020,09,11
226,Great Hotel in Belfast,Wonderful hotel in Belfast. Staff exceptionally friendly and courteous and the general upkeep of the hotel to a very high standard. Nice furnishing and feel. Brian in the bar was the stand out employee for us during this visit. Well done.,4,2020,09,09
226,Outstanding hotel and staff,"We arrived at this beautiful hotel sadly only for one nights stay as we were travelling home on the ferry the next day. Greeted by our very courteous friendly concierge and valet, nothing too much trouble. Service second to none, room fantastic in decor and every essential you could wish for. Great location, and well worth 5 stars, wish we could have stayed longer. ",5,2020,09,08
226,Will definitely be returning!,"Absolutely loved our stay (the first of many), staff were so welcoming and friendly, got an executive city view room which was spotless and decorated lovely. Breakfast the next morning was perfect. Definitely 5* for a reason not a bad word to say. Made the anniversary magical, thank you.",5,2020,09,06
226,Anniversary,Lovely hotel..booked tonight for our 20th wedding anniversary and a bit disappointed to be put in a disabled room with shower curtain and lots of disabled railings ...had requested a bath but got a shower only.  Back to Merchant I think.,2,2020,09,04
226,Lovely clean and welcoming,"The hotel is lovely. The gent on reception (Nathan) during check in was lovely.
The concierge was very helpful and kind.
The bed was unbelievably comfortable, we normally struggle to sleep the first night anywhere but we're out like lights both nights. Huge shower and bath was big enough for us both to relax in.
Breakfast was tasty with a good selection of cook to order food and cold help yourself buffet and staff during service were lovely.
Was very reassuring to see hand sanitiser everywhere for guests to use.
My only concern was the blonde morning receptionist on leaving was less than friendly.",5,2020,09,03
226,Worryingly unclean and poor service ,"I‚Äôd like to start this by saying that all grievances had been made known to the hotel before posting this but they were initially ignored and I‚Äôve since been ignored after questioning their explanations for the various issues.

For a 5* hotel to offer an overall service like this is pretty shocking. In an age that has cleanliness at the forefront of service, the place was worryingly unclean. Hair and stains on seats (unsure whether they were organic but still), brown stains in the bath, a filthy mirror and poor customer services overall - I very much doubt I‚Äôll be back.¬†

I was also charged twice for the room which the manager blamed on Expedia (I booked through Hotels.com) and the charges were showing that the merchant was the hotel, not Expedia. There was an inconsistent explanation for this from several staff members but was ultimately sorted after a few days of chasing.¬†

There were also random little issues such as no tv remote (had to download a Samsung app) and a rather loud ongoing domestic dispute in the room opposite in the early hours of the morning. I was offered a partial refund for the stay which I initially accepted as I understand some things could be an anomaly but after this my mails were ignored and refund never arrived so here is the review. If in Belfast I‚Äôd advise you try either the Malmaisson or the suites in the Radisson Blu.

",1,2020,09,03
226,Not good value,Not worth the ¬£200 + price tag. I have experienced 5 star all over Britain. The interior design is nice but customer service poor . No record of a dinner reservation and was not rectified until I insisted. The food in the restaurant restricted and of poor quality.  Dont waste your funds .,1,2020,09,01
226,Great stay,"Stayed here for a night a few weeks ago, couldn‚Äôt fault the room, very big comfortable beds, quiet rooms, everything was clean. Perfect location, Victoria square is only a 10 minute walk and there are many restaurants and pubs near by for a bite to eat. Only disappointment was the breakfast, I asked for gluten free options and I was told to go up and check the table (everything was individually wrapped) and my only option was one cookie that was left, being a celiac isn‚Äôt an option but it seemed like anybody could grab from the gluten free section which meant the celiacs didn‚Äôt have as much choice. I then ordered hot food off the menu which took 40 minutes to come and when it did the gf toast was cold which was a bit disappointing. This didn‚Äôt really have a negative impact on my stay as I am used to not having many options as I am celiac but for a 5 star hotel I was expecting a little bit more. Hopefully the next time I return things will be better! Staff were very friendly and polite and were more than happy to assist with any queries or questions I had during my stay.",4,2020,08,31
226,no time like the present,"after months in lockdown it has been a huge relief to get back out and about. Fitzwilliam is a perfect place to stay and base oneself in the heart of the city. we used the bar, room service and the parking facility all of which i can thoroughly recommend",5,2020,08,31
226,Not 5 star,"Had great expectations arriving to our second destination in Northern Ireland.

This hotel is NOT 5 star by any means .

The room is nice, the bathrooms no better than travel lodge.The restaurant which denied our pre booking was poor with a set menu similar to that offered by a three star and served equal quality food. Do not expect more than this. 

Staff disinterested unless pushed on service,  other than Patrick in the bar who provided cheerful and attentive interest in the client .

Save your money and go elsewhere .

The highlight , no highlight",1,2020,08,30
226,It was top class,"Such a lovely welcome at reception. Hotel was spotless and had a great atmosphere. Our room was spacious clean trendy. Staff were great from the cleaning service to breakfast were they couldn't do enough for you. We had a baby with us and were made feel right at home.
Great location just a few min walk from shops. Anything you need is on your doorstep.
We Spent 2 nights here and are just going to book it again for next month.

The only complaint I have is the price of their parking but it's the same with all the hotels. We just parked around the Corner.

But yes great hotel great service great location great food.

We loved it. ",5,2020,08,30
226,Lovely hotel with great staff,"We had a lovely three night stay in the Fitzwilliam. The hotel is beautiful, especially the rooms with nice little touches, like playing cards and ear plugs. Spotlessly clean and all the staff were absolutely fantastic. Phil the concierge had so much information, not just on Belfast but the surrounding areas and he was very generous with his time and Victoria in the bar is a superstar. Would really recommend for stay in Belfast.",5,2020,08,30
226,Anniversary Break,We stayed in the Fitzwilliam on the 28th August and have not one complaint about the hotel. The location is great and central. The evening meal was beautiful and Breakfast was fantastic too. Everything was clean and staff were very friendly. ,5,2020,08,30
226,Amazing hotel and service,"Loved our visit in February, the staff are exceptional from the front desk until your leaving.. nothing is too much hassle.

Food was top class and room was stunning and spotless

Cannot wait to return.",5,2020,08,26
226,Excellent,"This was the nicest hotel I've ever stayed in. The staff were so polite and helpful. The hotel has a perfect location within the city. The room was spacious, incredibly clean & comfortable. I couldn't recommend this place enough. ",5,2020,08,25
226,15 year anniversary,"We stayed for our 15 year anniversary. Absolute gorgeous hotel, rooms were spotless. I even got surprised wif an anniversary treat sweet and card. We enjoyed every min of it and cant wait to next time üòç",5,2020,08,24
226,Holiday ,"The Fitzwilliam is a first class hotel. From the moment we arrived we were so well looked after. 
We ate in the restaurant the first night and it was amazing. 
Loved the decor and all the friendly staff. 
It‚Äôs also so central. We stayed 2 nights and we didn‚Äôt want to leave. Definitely recommend it. ",5,2020,08,24
226,Afternoon Tea - splendid!! ,"The afternoon tea today was absolutely amazing, it was spotlessly clean and Anna the restaurant manager immediately put us at ease and couldn't have been nicer or more attentive during our visit. We felt so well taken care of and nothing was too much trouble! 

The afternoon tea itself was absolutely stunning , beautiful food, great presentation and everything was fresh and very tasty! We were highly impressed and will be back! 

Thank you! ",5,2020,08,22
226,Afternoon Tea,Just home from spending a very pleasant afternoon in the Fitzwilliam hotel for afternoon tea. Felt very safe Brian our server was absolutely fantastic and nothing was too much trouble for him with is pleasant welcoming manner.The food was absolutely delicious from the savoury to the sweet things all with any amount of teas and coffees.Would highly recommend this for an afternoon of indulgence. It was our 20th wedding anniversary and Brian and the hotel made it worth remembering thank you,5,2020,08,21
226,Beautiful finish,"We were a party of 11 booked in 2 family rooms and 3 double rooms. This hotel is stunning decor wise and the location is wonderful for exploring the city and resteraunt ect. However, there were a few things lacking that I feel a hotel with this rating should have as standard. There were no gowns in the rooms, but some were brought when requested. The family rooms only had enough towels and toiletries for 2 people and the water in the room was chargeable! As we had 2 types of room we were able see that the family rooms had an iPad which could be used to order services from the hotel but the double rooms do not. A hotel of this standard would normally have more than the lobby as a communal area and for a large party such as ours we often felt in the way if all wanting to sit together in a communal space.
Having said all this the service was excellent and the food was beautiful. Thanks to Patrick for his help with my son's bday cake and the resteraunt reccomendations. Great stay overall.",3,2020,08,20
226,"Not a 5*, But Concerns Dealt With","Unfortunately, we had a number of issues during our stay for a weekend in January. I must preface the review by saying that when I brought the issues to the attention of the manager upon check out, he removed approx ¬£80 from the bill (room service and mini bar), which was certainly appreciated, and our concerns were taken seriously and dealt with. 

Ultimately, the hotel is a nice 4*, certainly not a 5*. The sink in the bathroom was clogged and the dirty standing water left marks on the sink when it eventually drained. I can‚Äôt imagine this wasn‚Äôt apparent to housekeeping when cleaning the room. Room service to the room was stone cold on the Friday evening as nothing was properly covered with a cloche and it didn‚Äôt come in a heated room service trolley. We had to ask twice for the mini bar to be opened and it was then not replenished. There was no one to help us with valet parking when we initially arrived on the Friday night, I had to go into the hotel to fetch someone. 

The location of the hotel is fantastic, and if I was able to obtain a reasonable rate again, I would give it another chance on strength of the way our concerns were dealt with by management. ",3,2020,08,19
226,Really fabulous stay,"All the pro‚Äôs- Food excellent, bedrooms very comfortable with everything you could want in a room(check the mini fridge for bottled water), Gym was basic but functional, location very good The staff very friendly and chatty while also highly professional and efficient. Bronagh in the restaurant was just brilliant while Philip at the front of the house was superbly knowledgeable and helpful. Will definitely be back",5,2020,08,18
226,Will definitely be back,"A great base to explore Belfast as the hotel is centrally located hotel with great valet parking (this needs to be pre booked and costs ¬£25 per night), All staff we encountered were extremely pleasant and helpful with any queries. Room was of good quality, well appointed and the shower was fantastic. Bar area was nice for a few drinks, pints were lovely.
Breakfast the next morning was beautiful and served to the table by the great staff.
All in all, i cant fault the hotel, it was relatively reasonably priced and I'll definitely be returning.",5,2020,08,18
226,Holidaying in Northern Ireland the best,"Given the current pandemic, we booked a last minute weekend stay in the beautiful Fitzwilliam Hotel and although we were initially worried about mixing with so many people in a hotel setting, our fears were quickly allayed.  Self-dispensing hand sanitiser everywhere (including the lifts), miniature gift bottles in guest bathroom, remote controls all sanitised and wrapped in plastic, continual cleaning of public spaces and more importantly ALL staff, with the exception of reception who were protected behind a perspex screen, all wore face coverings!  Staff as always were friendly and courteous and appeared to be very pleased to be back working in the hospitality business.  Great to see large numbers of people from the Republic coming up to avail of the hospitality of the folk in Northern Ireland and of course the beautiful countryside.  The weather made it all that little bit special.",5,2020,08,17
226,Not a 5 star experience,"We booked the Celebration Experience for our wedding anniversary. We had our table booked for 7.15. Whilst getting ready, suddenly there was a huge bang from the room next door. How the mirror on the wall didn‚Äôt come of the wall is a mystery. Then raised voices with foul language and a woman screaming. It also sounded as if items were being thrown around the room and hitting the walls. I called reception as I feared for the well being of the person in the room and also our own safety. Reception said they would send someone up. We waited and the shouting and cursing continued unabated so much so I had to call reception again as no one had appeared. In fact it was so loud I was able to record it on my phone. Eventually someone arrived and spoke to a woman in the room who said everything was ok. We were contacted shortly afterwards by reception and I said there was still raised voices. We explained we were not happy to stay in the room and reception acknowledged that and said someone would contact us with an alternative room. By this time we had to rush to get ready for our dinner booking. No one ever came back to us. We had arranged to meet some friends later and didn‚Äôt have time to enquire more about the room but was still expecting a phone call from the hotel. Nothing, even though they had a contact number.  We spent an anxious night in the room.
When checking out we were asked the proverbial ‚Äúeverything ok?‚Äù When I explained no the duty manager spoke to us. I played the recording to her and she agreed this wasn‚Äôt acceptable. She said that all she could do was to remove two supplements off the bill...a ¬£22 bottle of wine and a ¬£4.50 steak supplement. I asked what was the ¬£29 ‚ÄúThe Bar‚Äù wine day,  she said I must have had drinks in the bar. I explained I had paid for any drinks and produced receipts, her reply was,  it must be a computer error and would remove it. That‚Äôs the best she could do! Even to get the reduction I had to return to the hotel as they had overcharged my card. This is a four star at a stretch hotel masquerading as a five star. Would not recommend.",1,2020,08,16
226,Date night ,"This is our favourite hotel we usually stay at Christmas time for my hubbies birthday but will the current situation my husband wanted to treat me to a stay away. Everything was perfect as always and we would made to feel safe, relaxed and experience everything we love about the hotel and their staff, food and high standard. Would highly recommend. Breakfast was excellent with a one way system in place and pasties in bags and lid covers on foods etc no detail was missed. Thank you so much and we look forward to our next stay. Friendly staff always eager to help and make you feel at home. ",5,2020,08,13
226,Perfect Birthday Break,"We have Just stayed at the Fitzwilliam Hotel for a birthday night away. The room on the 9th floor had an amazing view of Belfast. The room was decadent and embodied the vibe we wanted for a child free night away. We can not recommend this hotel highly enough and will now be the only hotel we will stay at in Belfast. We were looking at another High class Hotel, however the Fitzwilliam won on the style of the rooms being more in alignment with our style.",5,2020,08,12
226,Fitzwilliam's was just the right fit for our City break.,"Situated in the heart of Belfast, the Fitzwilliam Hotel was ideal for our City break.  The staff were very professional and extremely helpful.  The dinner in the bar was of an excellent standard and quality.  A peaceful nights sleep was had despite being in the centre of the City. Ticked all the boxes for us.",5,2020,08,11
226,Fantastic Stay,"Room was great
Breakfast was great
Location was great
Staff were really great, very friendly, helpful and competent. Arranged a hire car to dropped off at the door.
One of the best whiskey sours I‚Äôve had
Never stayed anywhere else in Belfast but can‚Äôt imagine why I ever would",5,2020,08,11
226,Average at best,"This hotel disappoints on most aspects, decor needs a full revamp, food ( dinner and breakfast), both very disappointing, housekeeping poor. I could go on...
The only 5 star experience my wife and I had at this hotel was on checkout when asked by the lady at reception if we had enjoyed our stay. When she realized that we hadn‚Äôt she referred us to the Duty manager Jara. This lady was very professional and very polite, so well done on that.",3,2020,08,10
226,Excellent,"Food in the restaurant fantastic as usual and rooms great. Can get a good bargain when booking room, meal and breakfast together. Perfect location for everything too. Third trip and won‚Äôt be the last!!",5,2020,08,10
226,A comfortable stay in Belfast,"A stay at the Fitzwilliam is highly recommended. The room was spacious and well furnished. The breakfast service was outstanding, and the bar staff were friendly and attentive. A previous reviewer has mentioned that, having returned to the hotel after a day‚Äôs sightseeing, their room had not been cleaned. This was also our experience. This, in itself, was disappointing, and not mitigated by the response of the staff member at reception who, on two occasions, said that they would speak to housekeeping and get back to us, but never did. On check-out, there was an opportunity to speak to the duty manager who was professional and helpful, and arranged for the poor service to be reflected in the bill. We may try another hotel the next time we‚Äôre in Belfast but, despite that, there is still much to commend at the Fitzwilliam.",4,2020,08,09
226,Room mix up,"On arrival the room we booked was not correct. 
It was then agreed that we would change room to a downgraded room as the one we booked was not available .
The room we then got the electricity was constantly tripping in and out but the maintn man who arrived was excellent so polite and pleasant 
",4,2020,08,09
226,Lovely and relaxing hotel ,Stayed in room 803 and had nice view out to the hills. Room was nice albeit a little small but would have no problem staying in it again. Hotel was spotless and immaculate. Reception staff were friendly and efficient as was the valet service. Bar staff the same and we ate in the bar the 2nd night. Both meals were excellent. Overall - great hotel in a great location and will stay again,5,2020,08,09
226,Belfast Base,"Friendly, efficient staff welcome you to this elegantly decorated 5 star hotel. The view from our room (508) was onto another hotel, but, this was not unexpected, for a well located city hotel, perfect for exploring this vibrant and interesting city by foot. The spotlessly clean bathroom was of an art deco design and if I had any criticisms, there were no dressing gowns supplied, as is normally to be expected of a luxury establishment and the gym was a small, cramped,fitness room.
However, small gripes, which did not mar our stay there. The staff have really tried to overcome covid restrictions and breakfast was cooked to order and plentiful (rather than a buffet). Great stay, excellent location,fab staff!",5,2020,08,08
226,Loved it! ,"After our holiday plans were changed, we booked a week‚Äôs stay here in order to see family. We‚Äôve stayed at the Fitzwilliam in Dublin a number of times and loved it.
The Belfast hotel is just as amazing, lovely decor with every last detail considered. 
We had a family room which was really spacious. We opted for the pull down sofa bed which our daughter declared really comfortable. 
Bathrooms are well stocked and the mini hand gels a nice touch. There‚Äôs even a candle and matches for your bath.
Breakfast was terrific, everything was Covid safe and in individual packages. The hot menu had everything you could think of!
We had drinks in the lounge each night, really comfy and great service.
It was well worth using the valet service too rather than city centre parking hassle.
All of the staff are great, well done for keeping the service going through difficult times. ",5,2020,08,08
226,Afternoon tea,"Definitely the best afternoon tea I have ever experienced,, the food was delicious and plentiful. The cocktails were fabulous, the service was second to none. Our server James was excellent, very attentive and pleasant. Definitely worth a visit.",5,2020,08,07
226,Excellent city hotel ,Stayed one night while on business in Belfast. Rooms are spacious and lovely views overlooking the city. Staff are lovely and couldn‚Äôt have done more. Had evening meal in the bar downstairs and cocktails are incredible. Location is in a lovely part of Belfast and close to everything. St. George‚Äôs market a short walk. Highly recommend.,5,2020,08,07
226,Alway great to stay here,"I stay here each year and it never let's me down, the food was top quality from breakfast to dinner 
Staff are so helpful and the rooms are so nice 
Bar selection is top quality, I don't think the staff can do much more to make u feel welcomne",5,2020,08,07
226,Beautiful,"The fitzwilliam is beautiful! Could have stayed a few more nights. The decor inside is lovely, the room was clean and had nice views from the window. Great location with everything nearby 
Looking forward to coming back again",5,2020,08,05
226,The Fitz was Fab,We stayed for two nights and thought the hotel was great. Really nice room with roof top views and a great bath tub. The finishing touches were perfect (ear plugs / playing cards) and the amenities were of a great standard. We felt very much at home during our stay which is always a sign of a good hotel. Breakfast was high quality and the F&B service was always spot on. Would definitely visit The Fitz again. ,5,2020,08,04
226,"Lovely hotel, very friendly staff"," Stayed here 2 weekends in a row Lovely hotel, staff are very friendly and helpful, its a very clean hotel can't fault it at all only downside is we didn't stay longer . We have booked again for next year looking forward to that ",5,2020,08,04
226,WELLL.....,Arrived at hotel and paid my room for 2 nights. They took an extra ¬£100 for safe keeping in case something got damaged. I believe that the extra amount was a wee bit too steep for my liking. Room was nice but not up to the standard I paid for as I paid extra for a better room. I will return as I enjoyed my time there and willing to give a second chance and therefore may change my review and star rating!,3,2020,08,02
226,Beautiful Stay,Stayed midweek for one night with my mum and we can‚Äôt wait to return. Everything was first class from staff to service to cleanliness. Breakfast was beautiful with loads of choice and that extra special touch. My mum hasn‚Äôt stopped telling everyone about the amazing hotel that she stayed in while in Belfast. Can‚Äôt wait to return. 5 stars all the way. ,5,2020,08,02
226,Great stay!,"I booked the Junior suite with breakfast, the room was great as well as the location. The staff are nice and friendly. In room dining was on time. Toilet and bath is massive, toiletries were generously provided. ",5,2020,08,02
226,Short break in the city,Really enjoyed a 2 night stay in the hotel. Central location. Room very spacious and clean. Breakfast super and we also enjoyed an excellent evening meal. Staff were very helpful at all times. Would recommend hotel and look forward to a return visit in the future,5,2020,07,31
226,Great but a few slip ups in house keeping,"We were greeted very warmly. Lovely spacious room. We had a small issue which was dealt with very well and accompanied by a bottle of bubbles by way of apology - very nice touch. However, two spotlights not working in bathroom or I could not find switch, sink chipped, spotlight beside wardrobe constantly flickering, ingrained water marks on bedside table nearest door, mirror over bed cracked and iPad not working. Individually they are small things but for a 5 star doesn't give a 5 star impression. Would try again.",4,2020,07,30
226,Luxury at a reasonable price,"We did a short staycation visit to Belfast and stayed one night in this hotel which is very centrally located and very convenient for shopping, restaurants and bars.  We arrived at our hotel early, 12.30pm and were delighted to learn that we could check in to our room. It was one of their standard rooms which was a good size and very well equipped and very comfortable. I particularly, liked the spacious bathroom with separate bathtub and shower.  All the staff we encountered were very courteous and helpful, especially the concierge. There is a valet parking service and parking costs ¬£25 for the night. A key test for me in a hotel is the quality of their breakfast.  In a socially distancing and Covid-19 conscious world, the breakfast room as very well laid out and the service efficient. A very good range of breakfast options and very good quality. The pork and leek sausage was very tasty. Too many hotels let themselves down by using cheap and flavourless sausages for the Irish/Ulster fry. I have given the hotel a five star rating on the basis of the value for money ¬£135 for the room and the enjoyable experience. One minor gripe is the subdued lighting in the bedroom room corridors and we couldn't find the remote control for the air conditioning.",5,2020,07,29
226,Anniversary Stay,Had a fab time at this great 5* hotel!! I really don‚Äôt understand some of the poor reviews??!! Staff were lovely and room was fab! When we arrived back late at the hotel we had ordered a pizza delivery and was delivered to reception and we were going to eat it in our room. When it was delivered one of the reception staff came over and asked us if wanted any cutlery etc.......now that‚Äôs what I call service!! Definitely would stay here again! Well done Fitzwilliam!,5,2020,07,26
226,Excellent stay.,Me and my girlfriend had an excellent stay at this hotel. The area was so central and quiet. The staff in the hotel were also excellent as was the food and drinks in the hotel bar. Brian who worked in the bar was particularly helpful and friendly on both nights of our stay. Overall this hotel is excellent. ,5,2020,07,21
226,Weekend Stay at Fitzwilliam,"I stayed at the hotel with my family for 2 nights. I‚Äôm not sure how this hotel is rated 5 star. The rooms were dark, dreary and musty. We went back to the hotel at 2.30pm after a day out sightseeing and the rooms had not yet been cleaned. When we raised it at front desk they asked us to check with housekeeping! No turn down service any night which I do expect for a 5 star. The bar was underwhelming, more like a sports bar. On a positive though the bar staff and concierge were excellent. ",3,2020,07,20
226,Great place,"Great hotel close to the city centre. Staff all very welcoming and friendly. Food was excellent both at dinner and breakfast. Hotel cleanliness was of a high standard and hand sanitiser stations placed throughout the hotel. Would highly recommend. 
",5,2020,07,20
226,Lovely hotel,"We've just come back from a 2 night stay in the beautiful fitzwilliam Hotel. We were offered a free upgrade on arrival which was very nice.the rooms are gorgeous with all your wants catered for. We had dinner one evening and two breakfasts. The dinner was nice and the breakfast was fab. Lots of choice on the menu. I cannot say enough about the staff. They are a fantastic asset to the hotel. They could not do enough and are extremely professional. I would definitely recommend this hotel which is also in a great location.
We had been also recommended a great tour with Jim Oneill which gave us a fantastic tour of the city of Belfast in a very comfortable Mercedes minibus. I've done many tours over the years but I would say this has been the best. Jim has lived through the troubles and has the knowledge and passion to deliver the tour of this beautiful city which took 2 hours, which seemed to pass in minutes. He gave us the time needed to take photos at prominent points on the tour and every question and point we made was met with great knowledge and fantastic wit. We would highly recommend booking a tour with Jim again.",5,2020,07,18
226,Disappointing,"Had to use the bar for our meal, we were in one of the cubicles and it was very tight space
Disappointed in the general standard of the room, various marks on the wall , the lamp shade beside the window were water stained windows were not clean and found it very unusual that when you sat on the toilet you were tight up against the wash basin and the toilet roll holder was in fact underneath the basin and the extraction fan did not work
Check out was disappointing, we had a meal included in our deal and had a¬£5 additional for one meal
When given the bill in the Restaraunt I paid the ¬£5 plus a¬£5  tip both in cash
My bill was put through my door the next morning 
and the ¬£10 had been added and was taken off after a conversation with the lady on checkout, she had problems getting the card machine to work and had to do it a second time, when I asked her why she was putting it through again she said it had not worked the first time although she had not told me this 
On her second try she printed of the bill and gave me the card slips and I went to leave
On checking the card slips I realised the card had not gone through again and I had to wait until she finished to go back and put it through again 
So I have to say my experience overall was not good and I am not impressed for  a 5* Hotel

226,Out of lockdown,"First night away and it was perfect, room was spotless, well equipped and very comfortable.  The staff were friendly, helpful and welcoming, food, drinks and service great and hygiene measures clear and visible. Well done Fitz!",5,2020,07,06
226,Special birthday trip,"Visited this hotel for 3 nights with family to celebrate a big birthday. This is a central hotel in Belfast and location was it‚Äôs selling point for us to explore the city. 

The staff (with the exception of breakfast) were fantastic and it was very clean throughout. 

One thing I would say is DEFINITELY skip breakfast. For a 5 star hotel it was actually a joke the set up. We waited 20 mins. At peak times you have to wait beside the lift in a tiny lobby area with 20+ guests all waiting too. It was incredibly slow, food came out cold and when I tried to look for someone I was fobbed off and told there was no manager around. Luckily we only had added this on at check in and did not return for the two other days. I did mention this at check out and i was told I‚Äôd have to wait and speak to a manager - I didn‚Äôt needless to say as had 4 hrs travel ahead but do not bother with it. There are many fantastic options around you. 
Also when we asked for another pot of tea - we had to go to the counter and ask as no one around - one staff member picked a dirty tea pot up beside dirty used plates and a spoon from that tray, filled it with water and handed it to my sister. This was actually Disgusting!! We left our food at this stage 
For the price and quality of food it was embarrassing for a hotel of this standard! 

Car park - colossally expensive and a nightmare to exit. 

Toilet flush kept going into the cavity wall when flushed so one night we had no flushing toilet. Housekeeping did fix during their visit during the day... 

Also my hairdryer was left here I called the following day after realising I had left it behind and was told nothing was found which baffles me as it was used in the room that morning. Person I spoke to was not helpful after asking for them to check again he said the list he had checked it the only place it would be recorded and that was that. 

For the price though I think there are a few things needed to be addressed. I have stayed in many 5 star hotels and this just didn‚Äôt hit the mark for me unfortunately. Won‚Äôt be returning.",2,2020,06,17
226,"Great staff, service and location. Triple threat!","I was floored by how wonderful my experience was at the Fitzwilliam. From the moment I arrived at 9 AM, they were kind enough to take my luggage (though my room was not ready), offer me breakfast and provide guidance on where to go and what to do. I had initially only planned to stay 1 night but ended up extending it to 3 nights. The room were well appointed (meaning: Everything worked as it was supposed to). The front desk staff (shout out to Joey, who was courteous, accommodating and didn‚Äôt miss a beat) as well as (Liam the Concierge) who provided great suggestions and directions. The hotel simply felt like home during my stay and I could not recommend it enough. Normally with Boutique Hotels, the service levels can be patchy  but this was definitely exceeded my expectations.",5,2020,06,01
226,"Nice place, except for the church bells.","We stayed here during a mini-moon. A lovely hotel and is well decorated. Service and staff was excellent. We stayed in the suites a nice room, compact but to be expected in a city. The problem was the lovely church/Cathedral opposite rings it bells every 15 minutes or half hour. Which was quite annoying. You may not have noticed in other circumstances but we wanted to relax and stay in the room a lot. It was quite distracting. The location is great, the stafforganised a great taxi tour. The breakfast was ok and I thought it would be included considering the price. A great place in Belfast.",4,2020,04,27
226,Nice rooms and great breakfast,Centrally located hotel with nice and quiet rooms. Breakfast was amazing with fantastic choices. Fast and professional service at check-in and check-out. Nice and relaxing atmosphere with a fireplace for a nightcap.,4,2020,03,26
226,A beautiful hotel with amazing service!,"As we walked through the door at the Fitzwilliam we were greeting by the concierge, helped to our rooms, and welcomed so kindly.  The rooms were amazing.  I'll start with the bathroom, it was so lovely appointed and they added extra special touches.  It had a shower and a deep tub. The amenities were great, including a candle to light for a romantic bath!  The beds were comfortable and we were very happy there.  I loved the way the decorated, it felt like we were in the lap of luxury.  There was a convenience store across the street and bars all over the place!  We had a delightful time and I would go back in a split minute!",5,2020,03,22
226,Simply superb ,"An outstanding hotel where the attention to detail, service and quality is clearly streaks ahead of anything else in the city (we‚Äôre speaking as locals and staycation fanatics!).

We stayed in a beautiful junior suite with so many stylish finishing touches, there‚Äôs also a beautifully-run bar and most of all a very friendly welcome. 

Hotel perfection, really.

Note that the hotel is in a city centre location but valet parking is available. The hotel is extremely close to Gt Victoria St train/ bus station.

Highly, highly recommended. Although a very different hotel, it probably stands joint first place with Bishops Gate in Derry as NI‚Äôs best hotel option unless you are looking for a resort or out of town type accommodation.",5,2020,03,12
226,exceptional hotel,"everything about our stay was exceptional, and I really can't recommend this hotel highly enough. what really made it though was the staff - incredibly friendly, warm and welcoming, and couldn't do enough for us. we'll be back!",5,2020,03,12
226,Tim,Nice hotel with friendly  an dhelpful staff good room and location .food not 5 star for me but I would  stay again service in  bar and restaurant very good  bar had a good atmosphere and was very nice and comfortable ,5,2020,03,11
226,Outstanding Hotel ideal for Romantic Night Away,"Belfast is not short of choice when it comes to hotel accommodation but after the recent experience my partner and i had in the Fitzwilliam, the choice of hotels in Belfast reduced to simply one.

From my initial contact with the hotel Reservations team to our point of leaving the hotel on departure its clear that delivering exceptional Customer Service is the ethos of the hotel management and its staff.  When booking the hotel the reservation team were able to assist greatly with regards asking for our room to be ready as early as possible on the day of our arrival due to ongoing medical needs.  The visit wa sinitally intended as a one night stay but a last minute call to the reservation team after the ending of some medical treatment for myself sought to turn this anniversary weekend into a celebration of two nights. 

We normally like to venture out to some of the many great restaurants in Belfast City Centre but due to our two night break, the  reservations team suggested the Dinner,  Bed and Breakfast option on one of the nights.  A choice which was to prove so much more enjoyable than my normal preferred bistro at the other end of Great Victoria Street.

Upon arrival we were quickly greeted by the Concierge team who couldnt have been better quickly assisting my partner and i with luggage.  The sumptious surroundings of the hotel coupled with the friendly attitude of all staff who regardless of whatever else was occurring in the hotel or their own lives had nothing but smiles and welcome greetings at every opportunity.  Special mention go to the very young staff of Jack and Simon on reception who were excellent. 

After getting checked in we made our way to our Deluxe Corner Suite with a commanding view of Belfasts City Hall along May Street towards Stormont.  The room was perfect with an extra large Kingsize Bed that made you feel as though you were sleeping on the softest, most tranquil of feathered surroundings.   The floor to ceiling windows on both sides of the room added to the feel of elegance and luxury not to mention every little extra you could ask for.  The hotel has a choice of pillows, so if you prefer something a little different just ask,  i was straight to sleep upon resting my head upon the pillow though. 

The bathroom was fantastic with a large raindance shower area accompanied by a large bath complete with candles and complimentary toiletries. However the added benefit of the bathroom was the ability to open the folding doors into the main bedroom if such was your desire.

The room complete with writing bureau and vanity mirror was well appointed with stationary and soft dressing gown along with the usual hotel slippers.  Also within the room was a hair dryer, ironing facilities, nespresso coffee maker, mini bar etc etc.  However the turn down service and complimentary chocolates just added that extra special touch. 

The room was well furnished and even though in the Centre of Belfast traffic noise never even featured during our stay.

The hotel is perfectly situated adjacent to the Grand Opera House, two mins walk from the City Hall, Ulster Hall, Ten mins walk to St Georges Market not to mention Great Victoria Street Train Station and Bus Centre approx 100m away.  If seeking a car park there is Concierge parking available and anyone with disabilities will find several onstreet parking areas for blue badge holders within 100m but these may be heavily used due to the City Centre location.  For us the Concierge valet parking is a perfect option with a convenient parking space at the side of the hotel to facilitate dropping off or pickups.  The concierge team are excellent in every way be it helping with bags or just their warm gentle welcome. 

If you are a visitor to the City the Concierge have an extensive knowledge of the City and can recommend places to visit be it bars, restaurants, shops or even a 24 hour garage.  My mistake of failing to avail of the complimentary newspaper left me searching the relaxing fireplace seating area of the hotel late on a Sunday evening to read an article in a local paper i had been texted about.  I couldnt find the paper and the Concierge quickly offered to find one elsewhere in the hotel, even offering if needed to go to a shop and purchase one.  The words.... ""rest assured i will get you one"" was typical of our stay, nothing was ever a problem to any of the staff.

The hotel has a small cosy bar with an extensive menu of drinks and the staff as with all areas where both friendly and keen to assist with any requests, even attending to my craving for chocolate cake late into the evening.  Breakfast and dinner are served on the first floor and both menus wont fail to disappoint.  Indeed special requests are readily catered for we found, nothing was ever an issue.  Special mention should go to the Restaurant Manager during our use of the evening meal option, his recommendations were excellent not to mention his willingness to persevere with my deliberations. 

Overall our experience was that the hotel is simply outstanding.  Whilst it doesnt boast a Day Spa or some facilities such as a swimming pool it still presents the ideal choice for a weekend escape in the City, a romantic night away or the Business traveller.  It has many features that has caused it to now become our favourite hotel in the City but perhaps its greatest asset is the staff at all levels.

The welcome & friendliness of all the staff who seem like one big happy happy are an absolute credit to the hotel. Cian Landers and his team have already made our next Belfast hotel visit a simple choice, however possibly only after visiting the sister hotel in Dublin.   Simply outstanding and the example every hotel should follow.",5,2020,03,08
226,Simple review,"Great location, rooms beautifully decorated, and breakfast was stunning. The jewel in the crown? - the staff. Without exception, the staff were the best I have encountered anywhere; friendly, welcoming, and responsive to any request/question.",5,2020,03,07
226,Best EVER afternoon tea,"The most scrumptious afternoon tea was our treat from our lovely friends in Belfast. You will surely not be disappointed. Service is simply exemplorary. Very attentive service of the highest standards possible. Recommended to anyone who wishes to enjoy quality afternoon tea which I, personally have not ever had better. If you go - enjoy. It's a proper treat.",5,2020,03,07
226,Fantastic Overnight Stay!,"It was such a pleasure to stay at the Fitzwilliam. We were made to feel incredibly welcome from start to finish. The rooms were beautiful - we had a 9th floor city view room. The view was stunning and the quality of the room was exceptional. We even paid a little extra to check out later as we loved it so much! Everything had been considered - I was a real fan of the in-room nespresso machine! The service at the hotel was some of the best we have ever encountered. The staff were genuine, courteous and welcoming. Chloe & Ciara on reception checked us in with ease, Brian in the cocktail bar ensured nothing was a problem (the cocktails were fantastic and the live entertainment an unexpected plus) and Alex in the restaurant made breakfast a brilliant start to the day. Highly impressed with this hotel - I hope this is our first stay of many! We will definitely be back! ",5,2020,03,07
226,Service with a genuine smile,I stay here once a month for a week and I wouldn‚Äôt go anywhere else . Even when little problems with the room they are readily fixed . I stay here for business because it‚Äôs very comfortable and has everything I need in a room including bath and shower ,5,2020,03,07
226,Great value for a spectacularly appointed room,The hotel is very quiet comfortable and beautiful. I payed 157.00 CAD and it was well worth it bed and pillow was very comfortable and the room was appointed better than a luxury hotel. Totally recommend it for the location and the service and amenities ,5,2020,03,07
226,All-round excellence,"Stayed recently for 2 nights and it was amazing start to finish! We called in advance to see if our room would be ready early as we were arriving before check in time and I was delighted to hear it was. Chloe on the front desk was lovely as was Nathan our excellent concierge who could not do enough for us and greeted us throughout our stay with a smile. Our room was perfect - spacious, clean, bright and featured all the amenities you could want and more! The bar is very welcoming and comfortable and has a great atmosphere. The location is excellent. Every member of the team we encountered throughout the weekend were friendly and helpful from the accommodation team and concierge to front desk and the bar. We thoroughly enjoyed our stay and would most definitely return.",5,2020,03,06
226,Lovely weekend but little things,"The hotel is gorgeous and in a central location. 
I would give it 4.5 stars for these reasons
Bathrobes provided were a little tatty
Toiletries provided I felt were not ones expected in a 5 star hotel 
Breakfast staff were a little lax. I requested OJ without bits, he went off to source some but never returned 
You may think me picky but in a 5 star hotel these things should be addressed ",4,2020,03,03
226,Puts the F in Fantastic,"A really great hotel. Somewhere special to take somebody special. great staff, great rooms, great foods this hotel has been a real find. Wonderful bar an restaurant. Very professional staff and so so welcoming.",5,2020,03,03
226,A hotel and experience to be trusted,We stayed here for one night for our wedding night. It is an excellent hotel with brilliant facilities and staff. We had been for drinks before and knew very quickly it would be a great place ro stay. Lovey time. Thanks you the fitz. :-),5,2020,03,01
226,Little night away ,"We stayed in the king executive room. Hotel was very nice, very fancy. Bed was big, shower was lovely. Staff where very helpful. We went out for dinner and when we arrived back we had housecoats, and slippers laid out for us, two chocolates on the pillow and our room had been tidied up. All the little touches they had in the room was very good. That's not really much I could fault with this hotel, only giving it a very good as the pillows could of been abit more comfy for me. But very nice hotel I would recommend.",4,2020,03,01
226,Great location- but tired,"Visited here for work , great location in heart of city and by golden mile!

My room was a little tired !! And needed a freshen up breakfast was very good and staff very helpful when required for assistance",3,2020,02,29
226,Ideal stay for couples exploring Belfast,"From start to finish the team here did everything right! So very impressed impressed with how each person greeted us and delivered a personal touch. 

Valet parking takes the stress out and you kick off the break instantly. 

Cocktails were delicious- if you‚Äôre there on a Friday it‚Äôs two for ¬£10. 

Best nights sleep we‚Äôve had in a hotel this past twelve months. 

Breakfast was lovely, Alex on the floor wait service team presents a mark of hospitality at its finest. A word to the GM be proud to have this guy on your team. 

Philip on the concierge desk set us up with Walter the Black Taxi (top class tour) and we stress busted with an axe throwing session (a must visit for all ages). Cheers Philip for a great afternoon. 

Thank you folks, we will be back. ",5,2020,02,29
226,Excellent choice,"Spent 2 nights midweek and it did not disappoint. Front of house staff polite and efficient. A stand out concierge team who recommended, tours and restaurants which all proved to be really good. We were upgraded to a corner room beautifully furnished and spotlessly clean. A well managed hotel and would certainly stay again. ",5,2020,02,28
226,three night stay,this hotel is located inthe centre of the city very nice staff were excellent the room was very good with a pleasant outlook breakfast so much to from plus the buffet we had an evening meal there as well and all cooked to perfection highly recommend,5,2020,02,28
226,Pleasant Stay,"Excellent hotel, great service, great staff who are very pleasant and courteous, hotel is clean and tidy but would expect nothing less from a 5* hotel. Beds and room was very comfortable and the shower was excellent.",5,2020,02,27
226,Fantastic place to stay,"My partner and I have just had a wonderful weekend in Belfast, we'd both definitely recommend the Fitzwilliam Hotel. It is quiet,  beautifully decorated and the staff were really friendly and professional. We tried the restaurant and the bar and everything was top notch.",5,2020,02,26
226,Fantastic Hotel ,"Warm welcome from Simon in reception was the the 1st thing that was great about this hotel.
Great location, nicely appointed immaculate suite and excellent breakfast. All staff were friendly and attentive 
Highly recommended for business overnight stay ",5,2020,02,26
226,Super Sunday.,"Arrived at the hotel for 2pm but the room wasnt ready, checked  in anyway and bags left at hotel while we went for lunch in the city centre. Lots of bars and restaurants close by. Arrived back at the hotel around 4 and the room was ready. Our bags had been already left up in our room on the 8th Floor with great views over the city and Cavehill. Room was great with all the latest equipment, service to the room was great and nice modern decor. Breakfast in the morning was fantastic and a large selection of breakfasts to satisfy all types. Overall, a very enjoyable stay and will be back again soon.",4,2020,02,25
226,A fantastic hotel in a great location they do great cocktails aswel!,"A very modern and stylish hotel, it has been designed and finished excellently, using some brilliant details like the big fire in the lobby - very contemporary and stylish. The location is fantastic there are plenty of restaurants within a few minutes walk, but you are also close enough to walk to most of the attractions - this helps as you can end up spending a fortune on taxi's during city breaks. 
Brian who was the bar manager, looked after us impeccably he was very friendly, polite and quite clearly a truly decent bloke who seemed to take a genuine interest in what we had been doing through our days here. I am keen to visit Belfast again and if/when I do I will certainly be looking to book into this hotel. ",5,2020,02,25
226,Amazing.,When I have a bit more time I will write a full review but would like to say this was probably the best hotel experience I've ever had. Everything from the customer service to the food was amazing. Will definitely be back.,5,2020,02,25
226,Birthday afternoon tea very poor ,Come on five star hotel. Afternoon tea for 50th  birthday for nine. Service poor food sub standard only thing that was 5 star was price come on belfast can do a lot better. Been ask to say more can't spoilt a pleasant day ,1,2020,02,23
226,Fantastic Hotel,"Can't recommend enough! Hotel staff were so friendly, the rooms were immaculate and extremely comfortable. Breakfast was delicious, lots to choose from both hot and cold.  We enjoyed lovely cocktails in the bar of an evening.  Really cant praise the place enough ",5,2020,02,23
226,Very disappointed,"Very small hotel, dont expect much space. There is VAT charge which is not included in initial price. Very noisy room, and you can hear everyone talking as u walk by rooms. Other restaurant was not open and the gym is so small. If u get meal included make sure u order residence dining only or u will be charged extra, but they dont tell u that. For 5 star, I expected better breakfast. Any extra drinks and food are extremly expensive. In my opinion this should be 3 star hotel, not 5 star. Room was smaller than I expected. Hope this helps other people from getting ripped off. Way overrated.",2,2020,02,21
226,Great hotel but some room for improvement,"Great hotel and location. Rooms are spacious and finished to a high quality. Issues around parking, plus speed and efficiency of breakfast detracted from overall experience. Great base to explore a great vibrant city.",4,2020,02,21
226,Well appointed and a great value,Great hotel across the board for business needs; breakfast was excellent and provided great convenience before a long day of work.  Only drawback for me was the room I had was short on clothing storage; only two small drawers and storing luggage was difficult.  ,5,2020,02,20
226,Fantastic 5 star hotel! ,"What a fantastic hotel! From the moment we arrived and greeted to having our bags brought to our very clean contemporary room, throughout this really was a worthwhile upgrade from our original plans. 
The bar staff were exceptional with a wide range of cocktails and drinks to suit everyone. 
The food in the bar on two evenings plentiful and very reasonably priced. 
Breakfast had wide range of continental items, smoothies, hot food cooked to order-and honey from an actual honeycomb! 
Rooms well stocked and turnover service in evening with chocolates mare us feel so welcome and valued.
Very near to city centre and main shopping areas. 
I will be staying here again! I cannot recommend it highly enough! ",5,2020,02,19
226,Poor bar in a 5*,"Couldn‚Äôt believe how poor this bar was, for such a grand hotel. Barman had to look up basic cocktails. Not busy and many tables left uncleared, despite a manager passing them empty handed many times. Would not return or recommend. ",2,2020,02,19
226,Pleasant Stay !,"Had an enjoyable one night stay. The breakfast was very nice.
The room was very comfortable. The curtains were hard to close.
The hotel is located in the city center and is close to shopping areas and a car park.
",4,2020,02,18
226,Great night in the city!,"We stayed in the Fitzwilliam hotel for one night. It's central location was ideal for shopping, restaurants & visiting the Titanic experience. Philip was extremely helpful and kind to us with bags, directions & valet parking. Breakfast was delicious - lots of choice and plenty of options for all tastes. We asked for a recommendation for dinner and we headed to a v nice Indian called NuDelhi. The hotel made the reservation for us. 
We really enjoyed our stay. Thank you",4,2020,02,18
226,A delightful stay,"Welcoming and professional staff and concierge on arrival. Room comfortable and large with a great bathroom. For the first time in ages able to enjoy a long soak in an easily accessible bath. My husband enjoyed the large separate shower.
Dinner exceeded out expectations. A couple of minor issues. Waited 20 minutes between given menu and order being taken. When I mentioned this to the waitress she gave a small shrug and said you were looking at the menu. The scallops could have benefited with a spoon and some bread to enjoy the delicious broth. Every other course was perfection. Highly recommend this Hotel both for accommodation and food. We will definitely return ",5,2020,02,17
226,What a treat,"We usually stay at The Merchant, but decided to give somewhere else a go, and were not disappointed by The Fitzwilliam. We were slightly worried upon arrival as there is some kind of constructions/destruction immediately adjoining the hotel, but I can honestly day we did not hear any of that during our stay. Great impression in lobby upon arrival, and very friendly check-in staff. Hotel had even happily accepted a parcel to the room on our behalf which was great. Our room was smaller than I had expected from website photos to be honest, but was perfectly adequate and beautifully furnished. Classical music playing upon entering the room set a lovely relaxing tone as we admired the show capped mountains from our room. Nice Paul Costelloe cosmetics in the generously sized bathroom. Shower was excellent and very easy to use. Clearly a great deal of thought went into designing the rooms, with lots of lighting and storage options. Various extras offered depending on your needs, including a pillow menu, which I took advantage of to avail myself of a pillow more to my liking. Housekeeping was excellent and room was spotless. Staff even delivered soy milk for my tea to our room upon request. Turn down service is offered, though we were always in our room when they came round so preferred to decline and just take the chocolates! We enjoyed a cocktail at the bar, which had a diverse menu with a good mix of classic and more unusual cocktails. The breakfast was a real highpoint with plenty of choice both hot and cold - the mini blueberry muffins were a highlight! A few small downsides to share in spirit of constructive feedback: amazing views but the windows really needed a clean on the outside(!), our room tablet did not work (we did report...), restaurant staff were confused when asked about residents' dining offers and pointed us to the wrong menu (we had to clarify ourselves with reception), the matches with our candles appeared used, and our room was quite noisy with standing traffic on surrounding streets (not hotel's fault obviously!), and fellow guests entering/exiting the lifts directly outside our room (room 803). We also had a small issue with ¬£40 randomly being charged incorrectly to our room, but when we queried this at check out, the staff were apologetic and rightly removed it. Overall we had a great time and would definitely return. Central location and proximity to bus station in order to catch express to the international airport is also ideal. Thank you Fitzwilliam!",5,2020,02,16
226,The best hotel service.,Myself and my boyfriend had the best time with amazing service. The hotel is beautiful and maintained to the highest standard. Brian at the bar was such a gentleman and worked so hard. He never stopped fir a minute and even when he had some time to stop and relax he decided to check that everyone was okay. Food at the bar was amazing and so affordable considering the prices of food in other hotels and restaurants.  Unfortunately our lights weren‚Äôt working when we arrived home late at night and Peter in the night team sorted everything for us with a new room which had such a nice view of the street. We were able to leave our belongings in the other room and collect them the next morning. Peter was a credit to the team at Fitzwilliam. We‚Äôll definitely be back for another stay.,5,2020,02,16
226,Best Hotel welcome and hospitality ever,"Just spent an amazing couple of days at this gem of a Hotel. 
Nothing was too much trouble. Staff extremely helpful, kind and attentive. Hotel itself is beautiful. Clean, comfortable and you just want to stay in and enjoy its vibe which is relaxing and welcoming. Looking forward to visiting Belfast again and this hotel will be my first choice without exception. 
Thank you to all the lovely staff!",5,2020,02,13
226,Perfect Stay,"Fantastic location, staff, decor, comfort, breakfast- highly recommend. Perfect for a one night business stay. Lots of offers for help, recommendations, etc. Would love the chance to come and stay again",5,2020,02,13
226,Top of the class ,Stayed here for midweek break. Excellent from start to finish. Could not fault any part of our stay. Certainly a 5 star experience. Brilliant city centre location. Super helpful staff and amazing service. ,5,2020,02,11
226,BAR - Such a peaceful and tasty place,"This is a review for the Bar, behind the reception...

We called in for couple of cocktails on our way for dinner and as usual, we were not disappointed. 

Great Service, great atmosphere and great surrounding. 

We would highly recommend this place and come back as often as we can. ",5,2020,02,11
226,Romantic!,"I booked this hotel for myself and my girlfriend for her 21st birthday. Upon arrival we were greeted by Chloe who was very smiley, polite and helpful and made checking in easy! The room was amazing. Huge glass windows to look out over the city, comfortable queensize bed and loved the dimming lights! 

The hotel had also left a happy birthday message, fairy cake and macaroon for my girlfriend which was a great touch and she enjoyed!

Live music in the bar on a night was fantastic! We preferred having a gin at the hotel as apposed to going out round the town! All the bar staff were great but Brian seemed to go out of his way to do anything for us, he was extremely well mannered and made us feel like we had a personal butler! 

If you're looking for a romantic getaway you don't want to go anywhere else than the Fitzwilliam! Thank you for an amazing weekend! ",5,2020,02,10
226,Amazing stay,"We stayed in Belfast for 2 nights to celebrate my pregnant wife‚Äôs birthday and we enjoyed our stay from start to finish.

From the airport the 300 express bus drops you off at the Europa hotel which is a minutes walk from the hotel.  

On arrival we were treated to an early check in and the the service was quick and with a smile.  We stayed on the 8th floor in a signature king room which was compact but luxurious. 

Room had everything you need carefully tucked away throughout the cupboards and drawers.  Along with a lovey coffee machine and an expensive hair dryer to my wife‚Äôs delight.

There was no bath but it had an amazing rainfall shower which was fantastic.

Overall very pleased with the room, though the view wasn‚Äôt the best! 

The staff at the hotel are amazing, from the reception to the concierge. Nothing is an inconvenience to them and they looked after us throughout our stay.

The food was wonderful and we were spoilt for choice at breakfast and enjoyed all the options. The smoothies were particularly great.  We ate at the bar at lunch and in the evening as we loved the ambience and the quality of the food.  Special shout out to Lorraine at lunch who looked after us and went out her way to get my wife a peppermint tea to go.

Extra special thanks to Victoria as I was looking for a bigger mug for the tea in my room, she popped back into the kitchen and fetched me her personal mug.  Customer service above and beyond. Hope the mug found its way back to you Victoria.

Would absolutely come back here again.  Loved my stay.",5,2020,02,09
226,"A magical weekend - best hotel ever for quality, service and care,","A fabulous experience. The best hotel I have ever stayed in for quality, service and care. The food was first rate and the rooms immaculate. However, the best part was the quality of service. Each member of staff we encountered was excellent, especially Fran on reception, Bronagh, the waitress and Stephen, the conceierge, The disabled shower was the best ever and accessibility in all areas was first class.",5,2020,02,09
226,Beautiful hotel,"In a prime location for everything in  belfast, we had a nice room  if a little stuffy (lack of air). Bar is welcoming, security needs to be tighter as a few homeless people slept in doorway. Decor modern.",4,2020,02,08
226,My birthday ,"Cant say enough about this amazing hotel warm helpful welcome from start to finish.
From concierge to reception to bar restaurant and breakfast buffet where I had my 1st bloody mary lol.
The manager cian was ever so helpful and it reflected on his staff pls see photos ",5,2020,02,01
226,Fitzwilliam hotel,Excellent service. Friendly and helpful staff. On arrival the car was parked for us. The staff were so helpful and we really felt welcomed. I would highly recommend this hotel and I will most certainly return üòä,5,2020,01,27

226,"Lovely hotel, good location and friendly staff","Checked in for a work meeting, really nice hotel, staff are friendly and helpful. Rooms are nice with pillow choice and big bed. Shower and bath and all extras you would expect. Restaurant was nice, service a little slow at times  did have a vegan/vegetarian menu but have to ask for it. Breakfast was nice and can order all hot food from menu. All in all very nice.",5,2020,01,26
226,Amazing Hotel!,I always stay here on business trips. I have been coming here many times over the last several years. The friendly and attentive staff are top notch! The breakfast is very good and hearty. The bar has a nice variety of drinks and serves very good food. The hotel is clean and very well appointed. Guest may use the Anytime Fitness gym which is only 2 blocks away. Great place!,5,2020,01,26
226,Excellent Hotel and service!,"This is my go-to hotel in Belfast. I have been coming here on business trips for several years now. The service is excellent. Breakfast is very nice and hearty. The hotel bar is also very good, well appointed and serves excellent food. The have passes available for guests to the Anytime Fitness 2 blocks away which is very convenient. The concierge staff is very knowledgeable and has helped make local dinner reservations and weekend trip recommendations. The Fitz simply never disappoints!",5,2020,01,26
226,Excellent hotel,"We spent a fantastic weekend in Belfast staying in this hotel. It has a superb location and the staff couldn‚Äôt do enough to help. The live music in the bar was a great addition.
The breakfast was top notch, and the room and bed were extremely comfortable.",5,2020,01,26
226,Afternoon Tea,"My daughter and I went to the Fitzwilliam Hotel, Belfast for an Afternoon Tea treat. What an experience from the welcome greeting by Jack on the reception, to Niamh who served us throughout the afternoon. Nothing was too much trouble, we had a table right in front of the fire which was really perfect on a cold dull day. Started off the afternoon with a lovely  glass of prosecco, which set the tone perfectly. A mix of delicious savory and sweet treats all washed down with an endless pot of tea ( and a take home box for the delicious treats we never got too to tempt us later). Can't recommend this highly enough. Everyone was so friendly and welcoming and Niamh even went to the trouble of giving us a run down of forthcoming special events at the Hotel and made us feel she really would like us to come back! Leave yourself two hours to really relax and enjoy this first class Afternoon Tea",5,2020,01,24
226,"Good, but not perfect ","We stayed here for 2 nights and were initially impressed by the service at check in desk. Our room wasn‚Äôt ready on arrival but we left our bags with the concierge. It was my birthday weekend and my husband had let them know this. When we did check in to our room they had left a card... but having stayed at many 5 star hotels around the world, we were disappointed there wasn‚Äôt something else. This is a touch I would expect from a 5* hotel. 

The room itself was lovely, with some lovely touches such as a candle in the bathroom, stationary, and a turn down service. 

The only real thing that let the hotel down was breakfast. We were blown away by breakfast on the Saturday which was fresh, warm and in lovely crockery. Sunday however was a shambles, slow service, cold breakfast thrown on a plate. I had read reviews on here staying breakfast had been a let down and sadly for us on the Sunday it was! 

There are so many other high end hotels popping up in Belfast, I think we will try another one next time! ",4,2020,01,24
226,Christmas Present Away,"What an absolutely fantastic hotel. The bedroom was so spacious and beautifully decorated. The hotel offers a 4 course meal to residents for ¬£25 which was off a very high standard. The Breakfast I was dreading because I read on here up to an hours wait for a table, well it was Sunday morning around 9.45 and there was ""No Wait"" for our table. The hotel has a table if there is a queue with orange juice and coffee and tea and croissants while you wait which I didn't see anyone mention on here. If you are driving to the hotel you need to ""book in advance"" as var parking spaces are limited as we found out. I rang the hotel and a very helpful member of staff on thr front desk called Nathan told us to park in the Great Northern  car park and gave us directions as to where it was roughly about 5 mins walk from car park to the hotel.

All in all a very pleasant stay in a really beautiful hotel with really nice helpful staff.

Thank you for making our trip to Belfast a memorable one.

I would highly recommend staying in this hotel
",5,2020,01,19
226,Amazing ,1 thing to say amazing!!!!!!!!! Staff are friendly and helpful the food is top quality and a very fair price we would definitely recommend this hotel for food drinks and accommodation thanks for a great time guys! ,5,2020,01,18
226,Great bar,"Had an absolute ball me and the girlfriend had a great time, dying today!! But really enjoyed ourselves, it was great after a long week but need a week to sleep it off. Great rooms really enjoyed ourselves hotel is lovely.",5,2020,01,18
226,Class Hotel,"Had massive problems with flights into Belfast and then with lost luggage on a 1 night stay for my daughter to attend an interview at the University. ALL hotel staff above and beyond in helping us to get through. Arranged replacement Uni paperwork, advised on where to do very early morning, very quick shopping trip for clothes. When we got over the line on Uni interview hosted us with such charm and attentiveness in the bar for some well needed g&t's before our departure. Wish it could have been more relaxing but staff could not have been more helpful or obliging. Worthy of mention, hotel was clean, comfortable, modern with traditional values. OUTSTANDING, looking forward to returning. ",5,2020,01,18
226,1st visit,"Fab stay .. beautiful hotel .. lovely helpful friendly staff .. very clean spacious room great shower and bath with toiletries.. room had radio .. hifi .. tea & coffee ..free bottled water .. great big comfy bed .. robes and slippers with turn down service .. mini bar available but expensive ¬£14 wine .. ¬£3 soft drink .. did not use .. 
Lounge is really nice .. found bar not in keeping as seemed more like a restaurant.. didnt have lunch or dinner as many nearby places better value ..
Disappointed with breakfast.. no clear vegan .. gluten free menu .. staff did try to accommodate.. but poor choice and one mushroom is a bit poor in my opinion .. had gluten free bread but sadly not vegan !! My breakfast was granola soya milk ... a tomato spinach beans and a mushroom .. wasnt very warm .. just think for 5* ..could be better plenty of choice for others bread cereal fruit yoghurt smoothies cheese ham croissants and cooked breakfast sausage bacon soda etc ..however would not put me of staying again would still recommend this hotel even on check out staff offer you help with travel arrangements etc ",4,2020,01,16
226,4 Star,Good staff but the hotel does not have a luxurious feeling and the rooms need upgrading. The staff were friendly and it is a nice hotel but it does not have the 5 star quality feeling. The location is very good. ,3,2020,01,16
226,Beautiful hotel - would certainly stay again,"This hotel is located 5 mins walk into the city centre. My Fianc√© and I have just returned from an overnight stay at the Fitzwilliam hotel to celebrate his birthday. Upon arrival we were greeted by Magdalena who was warm, welcoming, friendly and informative. She promptly checked us in. The concierge offered us help with our luggage and stated that they can help with recommendations around the city if needed. The hotel is absolutely beautiful. Our room door was glass, a stunning feature.  The room itself was tastefully decorated. It was very spacious and modern. Inside the wardrobe there was an umbrella to use around the city which was a lovely touch considering Belfast doesn‚Äôt see much sun. There was a safe, dressing gown, slippers, tea and coffee making facilities, a mini bar, desk, hairdryer and magazines. The bathroom is also beautifully decorated with two light options which helps set the mood. The toiletries smelt lush and the candle at the bath side was a lovely touch. The bed was very spacious and comfortable, we had a great nights sleep. The room also has lots of mirrors which is great for when your getting ready to go out. I must say the entire hotel is spotless. We were on the 7th floor in an executive room so we have a nice view over the city. The hotel had left a birthday card and sweet treat for our arrival as I had notified them that it was my fianc√©‚Äôs birthday, this was such a nice touch! We ordered room service and it arrived within 30 minutes, the presentation was lovely and the food tasted beautiful. The turn down service is a nice service with the chocolates before bedtime. The next morning we went for breakfast and was seated immediately. Kierna took our order and it arrived promptly. I must say breakfast was delicious and very fresh as it was cooked to order. The smoothies in glass bottles are so cute! Upon check out Magdalena was again very friendly and ensured we enjoyed our stay. This was our first trip to the Fitzwilliam and I can confidently say we will be returning again soon. Thank you so much!",5,2020,01,14
226,Great Hotel In Belfast City Centre,"We've stayed at the Fitzwilliam a few times and we've always had a great stay here. It's well located, staff are great and friendly. Rooms are comfortable and well appointed. It's very well located and easily accessed. Close to restaurants, shops and entertainment venues. Breakfast is really good, with a wide variety to choose from. Highly recommended.",5,2020,01,14
226,brilliant weekend in Belfast,"we stayed in a super hotel, the Fitzwilliam ,very centrally located, easy walk to some fantastic pubs, and restaurants.The Breakfast is beyond good, and the staff cant do enough for you. once you've mastered the Irish accent you'll be fine ! even though it  was bad weather on one of the days it was still a very enjoyable break. The Titanic experience is a must and the Museum is a killer (free also ,although you donate at the the end its so good) ",5,2020,01,13
226,Amazing stay,Cannot wait to stay there again. The service and friendliness of the staff was outstanding. We really can't fault this hotel in any way. The bar was a fantastic place to relax over a couple of drinks and the restaurant for breakfast was the best I have ever experienced. A real treat !!,5,2020,01,12
226,Very central and comfortable city hotel,Very nice boutique hotel. 5 mins walk to city hall & main shopping district and close to good transport. Very friendly staff. Concierge staff gave good advise on where to eat and where to visit. They have valet parking with their own cap park which we availed of. Very handy when you are staying for a couple of days. ,4,2020,01,09

226,One of the best,"We stayed for a couple of days over new year and thought this hotel one of the best ever. Most helpful staff who looked after my wife when I was taken ill.

Great room on floor 9,actually designed with sleeping in mind,and one of the most comfy beds. And at last a walk in shower with taps positioned so you can set it up without getting cold and wet first.

The new years eve dinner was excellent.  All in all a fine hotel.",5,2020,01,07
226,Helpful and Friendly,Excellent hotel staff very helpful and friendly particularly Bethany in the Restaurant. Stayed on the 9th Floor the bedroom had great facilities with an excellent view over the city centre and the whole hotel very clean. Breakfast was amazing with the continental selection very impressive and I heartily recommend the Fitzwilliam Fried Breakfast delicious.,5,2020,01,06
226,Amazing,"Stayed here over summer, staff were amazing. The turn down at bed time is such a lovely surprise to come back to your room to. The hotel makes you feel like your in a movie! amazing! The bar staff and cocktails were fabulous. We got room service and had a beautiful message from the chef on our desert. I couldn‚Äôt be more delighted. Also bought an umbrella",5,2020,01,05

226,Try this hotel !,"Great stay, lovely hotel, attentive staff and very central location. Would love to visit here again. We were delighted at how friendly and helpful every one was from the concierge to the reception ,bar staff and even people serving late at night. Very patient and accommodating. ",4,2020,01,04
226,Nice but not 5 star,"Clean and friendly as you would expect food was nice, but it just wasn't 5* little touches here and there doors chipped wardrobes marked mini bar was locked had to ring to get unlocked, the bar decor looked so cheap and tacky, I wouldn't return I think it's very expensive for what it is.",3,2020,01,03
226,amazing beds!,"Hotel was gorgeous, staff were very friendly and professional. Beds were to die for! Would 100% stay here again. Had food in the bar and it was reasonably priced and was delicious. Short walk into Belfast Town and very close to Great Victoria Street train station. Overall, really enjoyed my night in The Fitzwilliam!! ",5,2020,01,02
226,Christmas Break with friends,Had a fantastic stay at the Fitzwilliam Hotel. Checked in with ease. Had a complimentary room upgrade which was a welcomed surprise. Beautiful room. Cocktails at bar were lovely. Meal included in package was delicious. Breakfast was really good with great variety. Service was first class. Best hotel in Belfast.  Will definitely be back. ,5,2020,01,02
226,Good but past its best,Having stayed in this hotel a number ion times in the past I feel the facilities are in need of an upgrade. Great location and great staff. Limited choice at breakfast for Gluten free (they had run out of GF bread!) Not much more to add. Better hotels around at a better value.,3,2020,01,02
226,Wonderful family afternoon tea experience,"I treated my mother and daughter to afternoon tea in the hotel as part of their Christmas present. We were met by a colleague and directed to the first floor. She then took the trouble to follow us up to ensure we knew where to find our table. We were then hosted by Anna Pyper. Anna went out of her way to make our experience perfect. The food was delicious and plentiful but Anna still offered to bring mum an alternative sandwich as she can't have cranberry. Anna did not impose yet was always available to top up tea and check in if we needed anything. She took time to chat with my mum and showed real interest in the conversation. Needless to say we took home quite a few sweet treats and they were still fresh and delicious that evening. Great selection, lovely mocktails for the driver and prosecco for others, an additional coffee after the tea and more food than you could ever eat for a very reasonable ¬£30. Great atmosphere and a taxi called immediately we needed one. All in all a wonderful afternoon tea experience!",5,2020,01,01
226,not a great breakfast experience,"We had dinner in the hotel and found it was disappointing not a lot on the menu, and when we went to the bar we found the bar man very unfriendly and unhelpful. We found the atmosphere dull in the bar and had planned to meet people in the hotel but then decided not to stay in the hotel for the evening. At breakfast we got seated and after about 30 mins nobody came to take our order we had to call somebody over. WE waited another 30 mins on the food and again had to call a waiter over to see had they forgotten about our order. When the food came out it was not what we had ordered! It was a disappointing visit
",1,2019,12,31
226,NEVER AGAIN!!!,"We booked this over night stay, for a treat. We are getting married in 6 months time and with Christmas build up we decided to take a time out. We booked here for the 5 star treat. We planed to meet friends in town for food and drinks so why not treat ourselves. I booked online, it was expensive but thought awk it's a treat. I emailed before we arrived to ask for carparking information and if we could do a late checkout. Day of check in, no emailed arrived. We turned up and the concierge meet us outside, such a gent. His name was gerard. We asked if there was a carpark. He said we needed to the car in. He went into the hotel and came back n said we had a space, took our suitcase and car keys and instructed us to just go relax and check in. Fabulous I thought! At reception the young boy informed us that our room wasn't ready, this was us checking in at 3.45pm. I had table booked for 5pm and I still had to get ready. I asked abt the late check out if it was ok and they did give us a 1pm check out. No other information was given, other than sit in the bar till room was ready. while sitting in the bar I received the email I should've got about carparking and late check out. 45mins later we checked to see if the room was ready. Still wasn't. I phoned and changed our time for food in fratellis. While our friends waited on us in town. 4.40pm we got the room. The rooms was lovely, and very clean. We woke the next day and realised we weren't told where breakfast was and what time, no biggie we thought, the info was in the booklet in the room. Got to breakfast at 9.15am, the que was right back up to the entrance of the lift. We waited and hour before we got a seat. 10.15am and hot food was served to us till 11am. The young girl that seated us in the hotel was so nice. She apologised about the wait and was very helpful. Chole was her name. We went back to room at 11.35am and packed up and got ready to leave. On checkout the girl at reception told me I had a charge to the room of 30 odd pounds... I couldn't believe this, after all that crap I was getting a room charge. The room charge was drink at the bar and 25pound for carparking. Carparking! Joke, I explained to the girl at reception that there is noway idve paid 25 pounds for the carparking. Iwould've got a lift in. Would've cheaper! After paying 160 for the room. The girl wasn't wanting to remove this charge until the man next her told her to remove it. I than thanked him only to be dismissed by him.Awful service",1,2019,12,31
226,Best hotel in Belfast,"Stayed here twice now, and the Fitz will always be the hotel of choice when in Belfast. 
The lobby is gorgeous and so spacious - great for a coffee or a cocktail. 
The rooms are lovely too. We had an 8th floor room with a view, which was really nice, especially in the evening when the city was lit up. 
The rooms have great amenities, including a tablet, coffee machine, ghd hair dryer and more. They also look and feel very nice and luxurious. 
The hotel is also in a great location for shops and restaurants. We knew where we were eating, but the concierge had some good suggestions so will definitely try these next time.  We didn‚Äôt eat at the restaurant this time, but last time we had food and drinks and they were lovely. ",5,2019,12,31
226,Short city break,Great location. Rooms and service excellent.  Flew into Belfast international airport bus into city centre right outside airport so no need for taxis and they are regular every 20 minutes. Hotel is literally around the corner from the bus station (Europa).,5,2019,12,31
226,Not a 5 star experience,"The hotel itself is stunningly attractive and very well interior designed. Unfortunately the breakfast which we paid extra for was utterly disastrous. It brought the entire experience down for us. 3 mornings that I may aswell have not eaten. Cold coffee, English muffin as hard as a bullet and hollandaise sauce that tasted extremely strange. Waited 1 hour for breakfast on our last morning and watched as many others around us who arrived after us be served their food first. Over all, I wouldn't return. Thankfully we were discounted by a great receptionist Chloe due to our bad experience.",2,2019,12,30
226,Stayed for Christmas,"Average experience. 

Not sure I would stay there again. Some the hotel is a little tired. 

While food was ok service was average. 

Rooms are starting to show there age, things like the sinks being cracked etc. 

I am not sure how it got it‚Äôs 5 star rating but it must be a few years out of date. 

Staff however are very friendly",3,2019,12,30
226,Bad 5 star experience,"Hotel overall disappointing room service food very poor matress hard and bed very low staff average attitudes but night security very ignorant faces not pleasant at all, could go on but can be bothered and for 2 night stay it wasn‚Äôt cheap more like a 4 star ",2,2019,12,29
226,Extended Christmas Break.,"The hotel was beautifully decorated for Christmas, the staff were extremely helpful and friendly, nothing was too much trouble.  From arrival until we left we felt the service was top level and consistent in all areas.  Great room and fantastic breakfast - couldn't fault anything.  We can't wait to stay again.  ",5,2019,12,28
226," Christmas break",I stayed here Christmas night and st Stephens night with my husband. I actually didn‚Äôt realize it was 5 star until we arrived! Service was absolutely top class. The hotel and room were fabulous. Breakfast was amazing. We had a fabulous time and would return in a heartbeat!,5,2019,12,27
226,Pure Luxury,"Very luxurious and friendly atmosphere. Friendly welcome on arrival and upgraded room for my partners birthday.
Room was amazing and the large bed was so comfortable.
The restaurant on the first floor was very modern and contemporary and very relaxing .The service was excellent as was the food.
Breakfast was truly awesome with a cold display of a wide range of continental delights...there was a honeycombed too which was running off into a bowl.All hot meals came out on round pottery plates and we're very nicely presented.
Hotel handy for us as we took a train from Bangor and got off at Great Victoria Street station which is about 3 minutes from hotel.
Couldn't fault this hotel..an amazing experience..will return soon",5,2019,12,26
226,Hotel Staff stole from us,"We stayed at the hotel for one night. We had to leave in a hurry because of a medical emergency back home in the states. My wife left her wedding and engagement ring on the desk in the room. We realized it 15 minutes after we left and had gone through airport security at 4:45am. I called the night manager, Johnny, who had just checked us out and he said that he would go and get the rings and mail them back to us in the states and email us when he had done so. We got home to Washington safely and were there for my Mothers untimely death. A week later, no email from Johnny. So we contacted the hotel and were told that the rings were never found. We don't believe that for a second. Someone decided to take them or just didn't do their job. We will never stay at your hotel again, obviously. Also the bed was hard as a rock. Thanks for nothing.",2,2019,12,24
226,If you are looking luxury this is the hotel for you,"Luxury hotel. Luxury service. All staff extremely friendly and professional. Lively Bar. 2 areas to sit, One more quiet than other.. Fantastic meal in restaurant on 1st floor.. Top notch. Highly recommend this hotel. ",5,2019,12,22
226,Not a 5 star hotel,Bar very small could not get a seat to enjoy drinks. Waited 1 hour for breakfast for them to turn around and say there tills were broken and our order didn‚Äôt go through but everyone els around us was getting their food ok very disappointed as it was our first time staying. Also stayed in one of the suits nothing special very small. The shower was the highlight of our trip  ,1,2019,12,22
226,Fantastic christmas break. So relaxing.,"This was one of the best overnight stays we have had if not the best.
We will be back in 2020.
We even purchased a voucher as a xmas present so a family member can experience this fantastic hotel.
Truly a 5 star hotel if not six.
",5,2019,12,22
226,5 Star but lacking character,"Perfectly comfortable 5 star hotel but unfortunately the decor was not to my taste. I just found the place a bit too modern and sterile. Staff were very friendly and obviously well trained. The rooms are clean and well appointed but unfortunately I found the room stiflingly warm. Unmemorable dinner in a very boring dinning room, but absolutely fabulous breakfast. Great location right in the heart of things and right next door to the trains and buses.",4,2019,12,20
226,Average for its price in a competitive city market,"Was disappointed after a long drive and a very busy rush hour journey into a very wet Belfast that we were supposed to have pre-booked the limited valet service. TV did not work throughout the stay (we were not told of this ourselves but had overheard rhay it was being updated and it would take 1 hour) 2 of the plug sockets in the room were not working and one was coming away from the wall. A nice hotel but some of the room starting to look a bit tired (chipped tiles) We did however like that there were bathrobes, a candle by the bath, complimentary mints and a turning down service of the bed at night. Room was at the front of the hotel so as you might expect in a busy city, it was noisy at night ",3,2019,12,20
226,comfortable stay,"My husband and I stayed at this hotel in October 2019, for one night. The location is very good, central and with restaurants/pubs nearby. Belfast's major attractions are within walking distance.
Valet parking mandatory, you just stop your car on the street, no drive-through. All staff very attentive and ready to help.
Room was comfortable, separate shower/bathtub, nice amenities with turn-down service. 
Breakfast was complete and tasty, including to-order options. 
Overall, the Fitzwilliam met all our expectations and would recommend it greatly.",4,2019,12,18
226,Top notch,"Most impressive hotel i have stayed in, staff go over and above to  help you in any way, rooms exceptional, beds so comfy, cleanliness at its best, food unreal, great selection, will definitely be back. ",5,2019,12,17
226,Christmas at the Fitzwilliam,Fabulous Hotel with beautiful rooms and excellent service. Deserving of its 5 star rating. We had an evening meal included in our package which was excellent value. The restaurant was quite and the food was very good. Overall we thoroughly enjoyed our stay.,5,2019,12,16
226,Perfection,"Just an overnight stay for us, but perfect.  Attention to detail throughout with all the little touches, chocolates on your pillow, bottled water by the bed, everything you might need in the bathroom including robes and slippers made our stay very luxurious.",5,2019,12,16
226,Excellent from start to finish,"Firstly I have to mention the breakfast it was exceptional, possibly the nicest breakfast I've ever had while on a hotel break. Everything you want/need is there. Room excellent, had a fantastic view over the city from the 8th floor. We made a slight mistake and didnt book car parking at the hotel so had to use a multi story car park however, this is just a 2 minute walk from the hotel and the hotel offers a concessionary fee. Perfect getaway and I will certainly be returning. Worth every penny! ",5,2019,12,16
226,Fantastic ,"Everything about this hotel is five star.  Rooms are beautiful, facilities are good and food is fab.  Had a great family break here - they have a great family friendly approach and are so centrally located.  I can‚Äôt recommend highly enough! ",5,2019,12,15
226,Lovely hotel in city centre,"TheFitzwilliam is a lovely hotel right in the centre of Belfast. The decor throughout the hotel is beautiful, but our room could have been done with a few tweaks for it to live up to its 5 stars. Some of lights not working, shabby bathroom ceiling. The staff were very pleasant and we had an enjoyable one night stay with dinner and breakfast, which was excellent. We did have a query with our bill as it showed a drinks charge which we knew was not ours and it took a while to work out that we had been charged twice for dinner.",4,2019,12,14
226,Trevor,"The experience at this hotel was excellent 
The food was second to none 
The room was clean 
The shower in the bathroom was fantastic 
The bar had a good selection of spirits and cocktails and was reasonably priced",5,2019,12,13
226,Christmas at Fitz,"We have been staying at Fitzwilliam every December (For Christmas celebration), January (for my partner's birthday) and sometimes summer (just a weekend getaway) for the past 6 years or so. We have stayed on every room (apart from the residence suite and penthouse) and all rooms are stylish, comfortable and with some great views (city/mountain). We have seen an excellent improvement in breakfast (includes menus, service and presentation) Staff have always been great and are very friendly and efficient with their service. Planning our next trip already.",5,2019,12,10
226,Just superb!,The best hotel in Northern Island! 100% it was gorgeous boutique and everything you would expect! Great staff and beautiful modern setting! Highly recommend!!! My only negative or shall we say room for improvement is a bigger fitness centre. ,5,2019,12,10
226,Our stay on Saturday 7 December,Our stay here was fantastic from checking in  right through to checking out . The bed is one of the most comfortable I have slept on in a hotel. The staff were All Very helpful and the breakfast was superb. I would definitely stay again .,5,2019,12,09
226,No where near 5*,"Pros: valet parking, concierge and reception staff,waitiers and bar staff in lounge very friendly and a pleasure to deal with.
Food was very nice.
Cons:
Decor in hallway is to dark, we stepped out of the lift and our room was in front of us, but walked past it as we couldnt see the numbers it was so dark.
Paid for executive suite, knew it wasnt going to be massive like others we have stayed in as its city hotel but all i can say is wouldnt like to see the size of the ordinary bedrooms.
Mini bar wasnt complementary as is the case in other hotels when booking suites.
Keep banging bathroom door off wall, no where to set make up bag, just small glass shelf so used toilet seat to set stuff on, lighting awful for doing make up.
Bar staff very unfriendly,seemed to be a bother to serve us, 1 drink was enough, think she may have been new as she had to keep checking what went into cocktails.
Ate in bar as restaurant fully booked, though at time of booking when we asked about booking restaurant we were told no need to.
Food was lovely, with big portions.
Breakfast didnt get off to a 5* experience at all, we werent shown to seats just told theres a seat in a booth or you can wait for the other seats to become available.
Food was lovely though mines wasnt the warmest, wasnt asked if we wanted more coffee or toast.
As for hotel itself, felt let down, looks so inviting and beautiful outside and lobby looked so Christmasy with gorgeous trees, but our first words were"" is this it"" when we entered bar.
Should have spent a wee bit more and went elsewhere in city.",3,2019,12,09
226,Meeting a work colleague,"This hotel is right up there with the likes of the Grosvenor in Park Lane, London. The service experience was fabulous and nothing was too much trouble for them.
We checked in early than 3 pm, however they took the cases from us allowing us to visit the city.
Upon return the cases were in our room and WOW what a room 808 is. 
I would recommend paying the extra to upgrade!
Upon leaving we were treated as if we were the only customers they had, first class service!
Thank you to all!!!!!",5,2019,12,09
226,Best Hotel in Belfast,"From the second you walk in , warm welcome and amazing services in all departments. we had our work Christmas dinner and simply every one extremely happy with food and staff high standard services. Well done Fitzwilliam hotel ",5,2019,12,09
226,Great hotel- only bar food very poor,We stayed for 1 night getaway as a couple in December. Chose the extra cost of valet parking but personally felt it was worth it- ¬£25 overnight- but I love just leaving the car at the door in a city after a long drive. Hotel decor is beautiful! Modern glam Art Deco boutique hotel. We had a city view room and although small (as expected in a city room) it was really beautiful with really lovely custom made furniture and accessories. Arrival by staff was friendly and lovely. We went to the bar for lunch and this was the only issue we encountered-we had 2 meals from the ‚Äúspecials‚Äù and honestly they were very poor quality. Service was nice and drinks lovely. Gorgeous breakfast the next morning- the cook to order menu was probably the most extensive I‚Äôve seen in a hotel. Quality was really good. Location is lovely and central. Lots of buzz surrounding the hotel. Overall the hotel was really lovely for a 1 night stay- if the food in the bar was better it would be hard to beat- but maybe we were just unlucky. We would stay again and would look forward to it.,5,2019,12,08
226,Excellent stay,"We stayed here for one night to visit the Christmas Market and it's in a great central location for that.

The staff were very helpful about us travelling with our 3-year-old son, they had a cot already set up in the room when we arrived as requested and he got a full breakfast with us for no extra charge.

The bed was really comfy and we liked the floor to ceiling windows in the room that have a nice view of the street below.

The breakfast was the highlight for me, delicious eggs Benedict and so many options in the continental breakfast section I didn't even get to try everything I wanted before I was full.

Our son started crying when I told him we were only staying for one night so I think it's a five-star rating from him as well as from us!",5,2019,12,07
226,Very impressive hotel.,"Friends had stayed here and said we should try it so having never been to Belfast we gave it a go and had a great time. Very nice hotel, staff and food. We were checked in quickly and the room was gorgeous with a nice sofa, comfy bed and swish bathroom. Location is great for exploring the city and we felt welcome and well looked after by the fabulous staff, especially on reception.  The last minute deal we got was an amazing bargain and although we feel we‚Äôve kind of seen and done Belfast now we might even go back as this hotel was so good.",5,2019,12,07
226,My only choice for Belfast,"The Fitzwilliam Hotel Belfast could not be more lovely. The staff, decor, rooms, special touches (robes, playing cards, newspaper, turn-down service, high quality bath products, luxurious linens, and more) all come together to make this a stay you will not forget. ",5,2019,12,05
226,Exceptional,This was our first time to stay at this hotel. We were delighted with the care and attention shown by all staff we dealt with. The room and facilities were very well appointed. We will definitely be recommending to our friends and will stay here again. Very enjoyable experience,5,2019,12,04
226,Great location and gem of a hotel,A superb hotel in Belfast city centre. Reception was fadt and easy. Valet service very speedy. Room on 8th floor was ideal. Very tastefully furnished with coffee maker and tea. Great shower. Breakfast had full range in a lovely setting. Check out was efficient. Staff could not have been more friendly. One for a future return. ,5,2019,12,04
226,Excellent hotel,"Amazing hotel, very friendly staff and rooms were beautiful, a great size and very comfortable. Ate dinner in the restaurant which was really nice and breakfast next morning was 10 out of 10. Overall great hotel and will be returning ",5,2019,12,02
226,Great Hotel and Bar,Great place to stay you are well looked after and everything is 1st class! Food and drinks are made to a very high standard and the Gins are made the way they should be every time - II go to so many places and they are just thrown together but here that is not the case!,5,2019,12,02
226,Beautiful hotel,Stayed there friday night absolutely loved it everything was spotless bed was fantastic style was lush bathroom and shower was decadent would have loved to have been staying for a few nights the people who work there were really friendly and helpful we  had a couple of late drinks in the bar was a little pricey but ok .I could only find one tiny fault and it that the bathrobes and towels were a little coarse and could have been softer but really loved my stay,5,2019,12,01
226,Its the small touches,Friendly and efficient staff from booking to checkout - always present but never pushy. Beautifully appointed room with small touches that made a real difference. Super central but peaceful room. Would highly recommend and will be back.,5,2019,11,28

226,This is NOT a 5-Star Hotel,"Disappointed to have forked out extra money for a supposed five star hotel. Still haven't figured out what stood out about the place to make it so. It was decent enough, but not when it claims to be 5-star. Been in better 4-star hotels.",3,2019,11,25
226,"Great Hotel, Excellent Service, Perfect Location","6 of us stayed 3 nights in the Fitzwilliam recently. Fabulous hotel. We dined there one of the nights and had pre and post dinner drinks every night - all excellent. Staff are very professional, helpful, accommodating and friendly from the minute you step inside. Every time we were looking at a map or brochure, we were offered help and very informative it was too for our city tour and our trip up the coast. Thoroughly enjoyable    trip to Belfast, the Northern Coast and Hillsborough. Highly recommend visiting Belfast, and Northern Ireland with The Fitzwilliam as your base.",5,2019,11,25
226,Lovely cosy hotel,This is a great hotel in the hart of Belfast. Unlike many big impersonal hotels this is very intermit and if a lovely place to come back to after a day visiting Belfast. Lovely rooms and very nicely appointed with some great extra touches. Only negative about the hotel is the bar staff who where not as welcoming as the rest of the hotel (and in some cases rude) and need to be improved to meet the rest of the high standards of this lovely hotel.,5,2019,11,25
226,Fantastic ,"I really enjoyed our stay here our room 806 had a lovely view of the city and was perfectly designed, they had thought of everything.

I would definitely recommend it if your looking for a hotel in the Center of Belfast ",5,2019,11,23
226,Fabulous Fitzwilliam!!!,"If you are visiting Belfast there is only one place to stay and that‚Äôs The Fitzwilliam Hotel. F try on start to finish the whole experience was superb. Friendly, helpful staff. Great room, wonderful breakfast and excellent location meant that most of the attractions of this wonderful city were within walking distance. We did the Hop On Hop Off bus tour on our first morning, which meant we visited those places which were furthest away and once we‚Äôd got our bearings the rest we did on foot. Superb! This city has so much to offer.",5,2019,11,23

226,My first visit,"This was my first visit to The Fitzwilliam on my colleagues recommendation. I stayed 2 nights. On the first night, I enjoyed a room service supper. On both mornings the cooked breakfast was excellent. I had scrambled egg and smoked salmon and then the best full breakfast ever.

I cannot wait to visit again next month.",5,2019,11,18

226,Weekend away,Great hotel fantastic staff great location breakfast was really great good choice plus if you come from Belfast international airport get the airport bus cheaper than a taxi ie taxi ¬£40 with a tip one way bus only ¬£10 or ¬£11 return and bus station behind the hotel ,5,2019,11,11
226,Something Special ,I stayed here with my husband on Saturday night. Exceptional service from the beginning. Our bags were taken away and brought up to the room immediately. We got to enjoy the best French martini in the bar. I loved all the little extras you would expect from a five star hotel. We were offered extra towels that evening & received lovely chocolates too.  A cafetiere with ground coffee appealed to the coffee snob in me. Candles & matches were available in the bathroom along with a good selection of toiletries. The bed was huge & really comfortable with a pillow menu available! The mini bar was well stocked also. I could go on & on. I intend on visiting Belfast for Christmas shopping and will definitely stay here again. Thank you for a special weekend. ,5,2019,11,11
226,Good but not great.,"My stay was perfect fine, however I did expect a little more. The bed was terribly uncomfortable as it was two beds pushed together leaving a large ridge in the middle. This is not uncommon in hotels but I've not had one quite so bad before. 
Breakfast is actually beyond exceptional and the saving grace of my stay! ",3,2019,11,11

Lots of decent toiletries, a candle and matches in the bathroom, playing cards, cafetiere with ground coffee. I had a great stay and couldn't fault a thing. After I checked out and was waiting for a taxi, I was offered a bottle of water. Little thoughtful touches like these left me feeling warm and fuzzy and looking forward to my next visit - I will be back! ",5,2019,11,07

226,A Night at the Opera,"We only stayed for one night but we availed of valet parking and the restaurant. The latter was excellent and what you would expect from a five star hotel. The service was excellent and very friendly. Pity we could not say the same about breakfast, while very friendly it was a bit slow, we had to twice remind the server about our order. Now the quibbles! No complementary mineral water and the valet parking was a bit steep at ¬£25.",4,2019,11,04
226,Birthday Getaway ,"Absolutely incredible, the best hotel i've stayed in by far! My boyfriend booked the hotel as a birthday surprise, the staff were brilliant.

The staff in every part of this hotel are friendly & efficient and made us feel completely at ease while delivering a 5 star service. After a peaceful nights sleep we went for breakfast to the first floor restaurant - what an impressive spread for a continental breakfast (buffet style, self service) as well as a great menu for cooked breakfasts (made to order).

226,Luxury break for two,"My husband booked a luxury overnight stay in 5 star Fitzwilliam hotel as a huge treat. Lovely welcome at reception and the concierge was great. Our room was fine although it is more than ready for an upgrade with a crack in the toilet bowl and sink. We had problems getting the air con to work. A drink in the bar was a lengthy affair waiting for drinks when there were very few in. Our deal included course dinner. The person who greeted us I would struggle to call a Maitre Dee was not equipped for the role. We both fancied the venison and duly ordered from a very friendly waitress. The guy came back and told us the venison was not on the deal(nothing had been explained before hand) we were disappointed and would have been willing to pay the difference but no offered. The choices were limited and uninspiring. Starter delicious, mains steak and butternut risotto were very disappointing. Desert was a joke the portion could not have been more miserable and apart from the brittle tasteless. 
Breakfast the next morning was like night from day. Excellent service from professional staff. Delicious  and varied offerings.
Will we be back- not sure",3,2019,10,30
226,BEST EVER EXPERIENCE,Everything about this hotel was 5 star. The service was amazing! The beautiful rooms and turn down service was lovely. I can't wait to visit again. The bar was such a relaxed atmosphere. Can't recommend enough,5,2019,10,30

226,Wonderful experience,"Winning a night away in Belfast, we had no preconceived notions on our trip. Incredibly helpful, friendly and welcoming is the only way I could describe the experience. The hotel staff were exceptional but the sense of welcome was everywhere.
The hotel has a great location, we walked everywhere. The room was great, well equipped and felt like new. 
We only are breakfast in the hotel, delicious easy to see why it's an award winner.",5,2019,10,29

226,Service like no other,"The Fitzwilliam is an upscale property well located in Belfast, but the facility is on par with many similar hotels.   What sets this hotel apart is service like no other.  

It started as we pulled up to the entrance.  The streets are narrow so no easy driveway with extra space.  We pulled into a tiny loading spot and actually partway onto the low sidewalk to make sure we were out of the street.  The bellman and valet sprinted out to our car to make sure out luggage was unloaded and our car stored the moment we arrived.  

We were early and our room was still being prepared, so we rested in the lounge with a cocktail and snack.  When we went up to our room, we found our luggage waiting and our coats hung in the closet along with the spare shoes from our hike that morning (which were left in the trunk of the car).

The room was lovely.  We had a junior suite, which boasts floor to ceiling corner windows on two wall of the room overlooking the city.  Elegant touches are the norm, including folding doors that open the large bathroom into the entire bedroom with a soaking tub if you so desired.  Separate rainforest style shower as well.  

it only got better:  When we we left for dinner, we asked the bellman about power adapters for our phone chargers.  When we returned there were two new ones waiting on the desk.  Housekeeping had turned down the bed, drawn the draperies for the night, and set fresh bottles of still water on each night table.

Unlike nearly every American hotel (upscale or midrange), the HVAC was designed for our comfort.  I travel extensively for work and keep a list of ""thermostat hacks"" on my phone so I can cool the hotel rooms to a reasonable temp.  The Fitzwilliam thermostat was easy to use and quickly cooled our room to an amazing sleeping temperature.  

The most impressive thing, however, was the service in the middle of the night.  Thanks to a Delta redeye flight that was far too warm to sleep (even with a Delta One laydown berth), my circadian rhythm was scrambled and at 3:00 am Belfast time, I was wide awake.  I showered and went to the lobby to do some work on my laptop without waking my wife.  When I stepped off the elevator, I was greeted by the night clerk.  When I sat in the lobby lounge by the fireplace to work, he came and offered me coffee or tea, which materialized in minutes.  

Every Hilton, Sheraton, and Marriot should come here to learn what it means to take care of guests.",5,2019,10,27
226,A lovely relaxing time.,We enjoyed a deal price which we were happy to pay for the beautiful surroundings and ambiance in the hotel . Perhaps the choices of meals in the restaurant were a bit limited within the deal. Only one vegan meal on the particular menu we chose from. Breakfast though was excellent.  Very impressed with the fresh honeycomb . Thank you. ,5,2019,10,26
226,"For me,nearly perfect","Fabulous hotel,location and staff. My only issue which is(for me) almost universal and that is sleep quality. Lovely bed and linen but room too hot for my liking. Yes, there is air conditioning but it was too noisy and it kept waking me up throughout the night when it started up. As I've said that is most hotels I've stayed in,but,crucially, not all.",4,2019,10,26
226,Fabulous ,"Great stay here one night very chic hotel lovely staff so friendly door men were so nice and lauren the deputy manager was so friendly we had a lively chat with her before the concert we were attending she chatted to us and told us all about the hotel

226,Great hotel in great location,Lovely hotel in the city centre with friendly and helpful staff. Close to the beautiful City Hall and shopping centre. Not a lot of time to spend as a business trip but would come again to do the full city bus tour. Views up to Stormont stunning if a little out of the way,5,2019,10,25
226,Very enjoyable,"Stayed here for 2 nights. Check in was fast and efficient, our room was on the 2nd floor, great size and plenty of hanging space. Bed was super comfy and the turndown service was an added bonus. Maid service is a high standard. Breakfast each morning was varied and substantial. Staff were all professional, friendly and helpful. Hotel itself is in a great location. The complimentary umbrellas are a nice touch. We will definitely be staying here again!",5,2019,10,24
226,Business trip to Belfast,"An excellent Hotel that deserves their 5 stars!

226,"Warm and friendly city, warm and friendly hotel","Belfast is a wonderful city to visit above all because of the people who live there.  Almost our first experience of this was on arriving by bus from the airport at Fitzwilliam Hotel.  A lovely warm welcome from the concierge and the receptionists, couldn't have been more helpful.  The room was comfortable and well equipped and the breakfast was great - a comprehensive menu! The hotel is ideally placed for the centre of Belfast and I heartily recommend it.",5,2019,10,22
226,Fantastic!,"Fantastic place and lovely staff. Would thoroughly recommend staying there. I will be staying there next time I'm in Belfast.

226,Nice Hotel,"I liked the modern decor and overall vibe at the Fitzwilliam, as well as the location. However, as others mentioned, the situation in the bathroom is awful - there is absolutely no room to store your toiletries. We had to keep them on the desk near the bed. Hotel would benefit from installing bigger shelves above the sink.",4,2019,10,22
226,Very Enjoyable,Very nice hotel. Very laid back but upmarket ambiance. Nice lighting and decor. Would recommend. Breakfast prices were a bit steep so didn't partake. Bar experience was good with plenty of table service. Main reception desk very efficient,5,2019,10,21

226,Superb,"We stayed here for 3 nights while on a short break to Belfast. Our experience at the hotel was excellent from start to finish. Friendly reception staff and very helpful concierge who arranged both Giant‚Äôs Causeway and black cab tours for us. The room was very comfortable and contained both a DAB radio /Bluetooth speaker and a cafeti√®re - once I have music and coffee I am set. Ideal location within easy walking distance (i.e 20 mins or so) of both Titanic Belfast and Queens/Ulster Museum. Great choice of food at breakfast and all of the hot food was cooked to order. All in all, a great place to stay. We‚Äôll be back.",5,2019,10,19
226,Fitzwilliam experience,"We had a fantastic overnight stay at The fitzwilliam, great service, lovely staff and very friendly and welcoming experience. It's location is so close to so many attractions it is the perfect spot to stay whether you are going to the Grand Opera House, Waterfront Hall or elsewhere.",5,2019,10,18
226,Lovely stay.,"Lovely hotel. Very friendly and attentive staff. Great location, though a . Parking handy though a rip-off at ¬£25 extra on top of your hotel costs. 
Some hiccups with my breakfast order, specifically ordered hard poached eggs, but they came out softer than soft. Was delicious when it came out properly. Service a little scatty too, we were brought other tables orders three times. Perhaps a the table numbering issue. 
Overall we had a wonderful stay and would highly recommend a stay to anyone. ",4,2019,10,17
226,Decent,"Stayed for a couple of nights. I find it a good value hotel in central Belfast. Meets all the basics - clean, friendly staff etc. The rooms are also very nice - always a chocolate on your pillow, lovely fluffy robes, slippers and a nice bathroom. Breakfast is pretty good too. All round good value and pretty happy with my stays here. ",5,2019,10,16
226,An excellent location and hotel!,An excellent hotel with efficient and friendly staff. The location is ideal for visiting the center of Belfast. The rooms and decor were to very high standard and perfect for our visit. Would highly recommend a visit!,5,2019,10,16

Didn‚Äôt recognize him without his fancy hat when we met him at a bar away from the hotel . He was very informative and friendly . All in all , great hotel , great city . Will be back ",5,2019,10,16
226,Wonderful Experience,This is an exceptional hotel. It is beautiful and it meets all of your wants and needs. The staff were superb. We attended a very nice group dinner at this hotel and everything was perfect. We would certainly recommend this hotel to anyone visiting Belfasst.,5,2019,10,16
226,An anniversary to remember!,"For our anniversary and after a small family wedding in Derry we decided to extend our stay in Belfast and could not fault the Fitzwilliam hotel in any way. I would go back in a heart beat! From Check in at reception it was seemless and professional by the lovely Ciara who answered all of our questions and was great at interacting with us both. Upon arriving into our room we were initially amazing at the grandeur of the interterior design of the corridors and the mirrors doors. The room was beautiful, spacious, bright, warm and music playing on our arrival was a nice touch. The bed was so big and comfortable, I could not wait for a good night's rest. The bathroom was so amazing, the rainfall shower was the highlight of the room for me, I would have stayed in it for hours. The umbrella for our personal use was a lovely touch as the weather was not on our side unfortunately. The first night we decided the hotel was far too nice to leave so we ate in the bar. The we greeted and shown to a lovely booth by a manager named Brian. We was so professional and the way he presented and poured our drinks was very impressive. The way he spoke to us was so professional. The glassware in the bar had a beautifully cut and presented to us elegantly. The menu was lovely. We had chicken wings to start and chicken curry and the Fitz burger for main course... The food was amazing. Both myself and my boyfriend work in the hotel industry, the boyfriend being a chef, and he could not speak more highly of thw quality of food and particularly the service we received. The breakfast selection was second to none... An amazing array of cold food buffet and so much hot choices too and again presentation was gorgeous,  charcoal, slate style crockery for the hot food. Breakfast staff did not seem under too much pressure so it made our experience all the more enjoyable to know at any given time if we needed something extra that somebody was there to help. Each and every staff had a friendly goodbye each morning we left the breakfast room. I have to say the staff are a credit to the hotel. I would absolutely recommend anyone to come here and I have not stopped talking about what great experience we had the past few days. If you want a relaxing break away in a beautiful hotel come here!! ",5,2019,10,16
226,Amazing stay!!!,"Service par excellence from everyone. 
The concierges & reception staff who were all extremely knowledgeable with regard to local attractions, the bar & restaurant staff who were always efficient & gave service with a smile. 
The food was absolutely superb & the rooms were spotless & the beds so comfortable that we had a deep sleep every night.
We will definitely return.
Thankyou to all who made our stay so welcoming.",5,2019,10,16
226,Elegance & Style,"If you want to stay in the centre of Belfast. With everything you need at your doorstep. This is the hotel to stay at. From the moment you arrive. There is a warm welcome. From the door to the reception staff. I stayed on the 8th floor in an executive room. Well worth the extra. Quiet with a comfy bed. And a stylish bathroom.

Breakfast was a pure joy. From an extensive buffet. With fresh fruit, cereals, cakes, cheese and wonderful scones. We also had a fantastic choice of a freshly cooked breakfast with a pot of coffee.

We did use the evening bar for drinks. Nice atmosphere with music.

Would definitely stay again. Thank you to all the management and staff. To make our trip so enjoyable.",5,2019,10,15
226,Superb food,"Great central location within walking distance to shops, pubs and restaurants.  Although food in this hotel was fantastic especially the breakfast it was superb with so much choice service staff were friendly and attentive.

226,A BREAK AWAY,"Hotel central to railway station, central to Belfast city center
comfortable rooms with everything you require, good food and very pleasant staff
Good hotel to stay at as there are plenty of restaurants and bars in the area
",5,2019,10,14
226,Laverne Boyd,"From the moment we stepped inside the hotel we were greeted by friendly and most efficient staff. As we arrived early we left our bags with the concierge, who then organised for them to be taken to our room when it became available. The room was beyond our expectations with robes, iron, ironing board,even an umbrella!  I couldn't recommend this hotel enough.",5,2019,10,14
226,Beautiful hotel but improvements could be made.,"We went for my partners birthday and were greeted at the entrance area by a member of staff who appeared to be a manager (not concierge). His address and demeanor was such that we felt totally out of place. He referred us to Simon at reception to check in and he was more than helpful and informative. However the initial welcome had already set the tone for us. The room was beautiful and we received a birthday welcome from the hotel which was a really nice touch. Later in the evening we went out for dinner and returned to the hotel bar and again service was inconsistent. We were greeted by a really lovely man who couldn't have done enough, but a young lady following up on his service made us feel as though we had outstayed our welcome. My partner wasn't finished his drink and I had only just finished mine with no view of ordering another and she came down and presented us with our bill and said 'whenever you are ready.' As my partner hadn't finished and we hadn't requested this it felt as though we were being made to leave sooner than we would like. The bar was not busy and there was no demand on tables or booths. This was really disappointing and made worse by the earlier greeting at check-in. Breakfast the next morning was superb, the continental breakfast more than sufficient and offered a varied and comprehensive level of choice. Our cooked breakfasts were fantastic too.",3,2019,10,13
226,Car parking,The hotel and staff are excellent. Rooms are very well equipped with everything you would need and more.One thing however is the car parking is dear for a room that costs ¬£200+ I feel the car parking should be free. An extra ¬£25 per night is to much. ,4,2019,10,12
226,Overnight business trip,"excellent stay but have an additional credit card withdraw i have just noticed and have no invoice for it. As everything was paid for by the company i want to know what i have been charged for.

overall an excellent stay with extremely comfy room and excellent breakfast.

will be staying again when next in the city",5,2019,10,11
226,A very comfortable overnight stay,"Very welcoming on arrival; nice ""sweet treat"" in the room for a returning guest.  Excellent service and food in the bar with very freindly and helpful staff.  Need to get up earlier next time to enjoy breakfast !",5,2019,10,11
226,Great service and super breakfast,"Good location, excellent service and a comfortable bedroom with a view over Belfast.  Great shower and bathroom. Breakfast had a good selection, hot food cooked to order of course and even honeycomb!  Staff were very good as you'd expect from a five star hotel. The slight disadvantage is an absence of 'wow factor' in the lounge area and that the bedroom corridors are pretty dark.  So all the things the staff can manage are pretty good - it's just a modern city centre hotel without a lot of space and so lacks the wow factor.  But within that limitation, we enjoyed it as a place to stay in the city and would recommend it.  A sort of 4.5!",4,2019,10,10
226,Wonderful service,"Excellent hotel, all staff were courteous and friendly. Obviously worked as a team . Would highly recommend this hotel . It was central , bar area lovely atmosphere. All staff were attentive to individuals needs ",5,2019,10,09
226,Nice hotel,"This was a nice hotel, with friendly service, which we expected given its 5 star rating. Rooms were as advertised and the breakfast was lovely. But our room had absolutely no outlook. Parking was a bit difficult with little space to pull up in front if the hotel but was manageable. ",4,2019,10,07
226,Fabulous hotel - can‚Äôt recommend highly enough,It‚Äôs only the second time I‚Äôve ever stayed in a 5 ‚≠êÔ∏è hotel and this one was miles ahead of the other. Fitzwilliam was class without being elitist. Breakfast was included and room was spacious and comfortable. King Bed was comfortable - 6th floor and lift was available. Concierges was available but not pushy when offered to help with luggage. Unfortunately it rained during our stay but there were plenty of large classy complimentary umbrellas to borrow. ,5,2019,10,07
226,Absolutely wonderful,"Had a fantastic stay, would thoroughly recommend. From the concierge to reception to housekeeping to bar staff and restaurant staff everyone was so friendly and more than helpful. One of the best breakfasts  I‚Äôve ever had in a hotel.",5,2019,10,07
226,Modern Luxury meets Old World Elegance,"This place was amazing. Every minute we were out of our rooms we were seen to by any staff we met, all making sure we had anything and everything we needed. They went beyond recommendations, into our interests, and got us to exactly the food and sites we had in mind for short walks. Their suggestions were perfect, and the way they took the time to draw circles and directions on a map of town made us feel like family. The rooms were beautiful, comfortable and well stocked and attended. When we mentioned a trip up the cost, they prepared and delivered a full itinerary of historical places, beautiful towns, natural wonders and even where one might bump into local celebrities. All of the things were timed out to make it easy to schedule where and what one wished to see. This was beyond cool, and helped us see some things we would never have caught otherwise. I can't say enough good things about this place, but I'm running out of ink. They are the definition of 'All the Best.'",5,2019,10,04
226,Top notch!,Everything about this hotel was top notch!  Rooms were very nicely appointed with all the amenities.  All staff were very friendly and helpful.  Perfect location - right across the street from Irish ticket tours if you are planning any excursions.  Also right next to the Grand Opera House.  On a whim we decided to see a show one night and it was a great way to spend an evening in Belfast.  Beautiful facility and just a few steps back to the hotel.  Would highly recommend this hotel.  ,5,2019,10,04
226,"Excellent hotel, great location","We stayed at this hotel for one night and our expectations were truly met. The room was perfect, the service was excellent and a great nights sleep was had in the luxurious bed. All round the hotel was perfect for our stay. 

Hotel car parking is a little pricey @ ¬£25 per day.",5,2019,10,03
226,Stylish but not always practical,"We booked a signature view king room here, which turned out to be a small bedroom with a spacious bathroom. From the room we had floor to ceiling windows with a nice view over the top of downtown Belfast to the hills beyond. The room was recently updated and stylish, but felt a little tight because it had so much stuff in it; I kept bumping into either the bed or the couch, and it was hard to figure out where to unpack. Lots of outlets were a plus, including USB outlets. The bathroom was beautiful and stylish, but could really use an extra shelf for guest items, or maybe some more hooks. The large walk in shower was really great. I found the staff friendly and helpful, and the location was convenient: close to restaurants, right next to Europa Bus Centre where the Airport Express 600 bus terminates, and about a 0.2 mile walk to the closest G2 Glider stop at Wellington Place. Overall I enjoyed my stay here.",4,2019,10,03
226,Nice hotel but a few issues üòî,"On arrival we had a warm welcome but on the third day it was as if we didn‚Äôt exist. 
The room wasn‚Äôt ready when we arrived but were given complimentary drinks while waiting by a lovely young women Ciara in reception .
Our room was lovely .....but warm!! The heating couldn‚Äôt be turned down and we had to ask for assistance . 22.6 degrees was just too warm to sleep in.
Breakfast was good but busy . But today it was served cold and we had to ask for the bread to be toasted again . We asked for a booth to sit in for privacy but before we were seated the manager proceeded to wipe all the mess on the table on to the floor!!! Not good !
The first two days were ok but sadly the team on breakfast today let our stay  down.
A busy business style of hotel ... some staff just too corporate .",4,2019,10,02
226,Will definitely come back,From start to finish absolutely amazing experience. Staff were extremely friendly and knowledgeable. Hotel is in perfect walking distance to city center. Gorgeous and clean room. Loads of GF options at breakfast.  ,5,2019,10,01
226,"Great hotel, rude restaurant staff","Hotel really nice and everything expected from a 5 star hotel only thing that let it down was the rude man on the desk at the restaurant, only went to check what time we could grab some dinner to be told that ‚Äúwe could get food from the bar‚Äù, obviously not dressed for dinner yet we got looked up and down as he processed to tell us that we could eat downstairs, didn‚Äôt really feel very welcome. We went to eat out of the hotel to a lovely place called the flame, beautiful food and really quick service ",4,2019,09,30
226,"Cute hotel, very friendly staff, centrally located","Really liked this hotel, great value for money, friendly staff, nice breakfast. The room was very clearn and there was a good water pressure in the shower, also a very nice Coffee kit, nice big shower including a bath and complimentary water. 
I did not like
1. No vegetables at all in breakfast selection
2. The Gym is quite underwhelming, very small and almost no equipment. does not look like it is being used.",4,2019,09,29
226,Not 5 star,"On arrival we had the wow factor, 
Until we got to our room. There was stains on the bed linen. This was changed for us when we brought this to there attention. 
We had lunch in the bar and food was good. We had a show booked in the opera house but left early to make it back to there restaurant  when we saw they had an AA rosette. 
Food was so disappointing. My starter was way to salty to eat .
I told this to our server and was told he would let the chef know. 
Then my main came out and again way to salty. Again told this to our server who was a young girl and she said she will let the chef know. When Finished our meal I had to ask was all our wine gone and only then was our wine brought back to our table. 
I was so disappointed that the chef made no attempt to make things right for us . On checking out the next day a duty manager took a whole ¬£30 off our final bill off around ¬£400.
We wanted 5 star,  we didn't get it.
We wanted AA Rosette, we didn't have it.
All in all we were both very unhappy with the whole Fitzwilliam experience .
Plus I was told all this would be brought to the teams attention on the Monday but still to date I have heard nothing. 

If you charge 5 star price 
Please give 5 star experience.",3,2019,09,29
226,Excellent staff and breakfast,"Went to the fitzwilliam for breakfast and the menu had so many options from healthy breakfasts, to pancakes and a fry, it caters for everyone.
The service was excellent, the entire time we were there we couldn't have been any better looked after. The food along with teas and coffees arrived promptly with refills!",5,2019,09,28
226,Poor standards rooted in poor training and method,"Stayed at this hotel for three nights with wife and four friends. Chose the hotel based on location, hotel website and Trip Advisor reviews. Restaurant and bar are completely disorganised. Basic service standards are missing. The staff seem willing however their ability to deliver food and drinks promptly is poor. This appears to be rooted in a complete lack of ‚Äúmethod‚Äù. Having spent circa 120-170 nights per year in hotels for the past 10 years I have significant experience of how hotels are run. This hotel is disorganised. Breakfast took 45 minutes to arrive. A beer in the bar took 25 minutes to arrive. In each instance I had to chase the staff to get the items. I would give this hotel a miss as these are systemic issues.",1,2019,09,28
226,A wonderful week in Northern Ireland made even better by The Fitzwilliam,"My partner and I stayed at The Fitzwilliam as part of our 15th anniversary celebration, and our first trip to Northern Ireland, room 617.  The hotel surpassed our expectations due to the level of quality of the facility, but more importantly the amazing staff.  The Fitzwilliam obviously places great importance on hiring and training only the most motivated people who truly enjoy their job.  The wait staff in the restaurant including Sarah Louis and Cora, and bar staffed by Lorraine, Beth and Brian.  All were wonderful. The front desk was responsive and helpful. and the Concierges Philip and Liam were very knowledgeable and reactive to our every need.  Management is present and active as well, including Jara, who was attentive to our needs and demonstrated great engagement on a personal level.  We enjoyed road trips to the places many tourists like to see, horseback riding  at Sheans farm, and a great tour of the Titanic quarter with a private guide Colin Cobb, who surpassed our expectations.  We travel frequently including to other parts of Europe and The Fitzwilliam is on par with the best of our hotel experiences.",5,2019,09,27
226,Great Hotel,"Service was great, all staff friendly and helpful. Room was nicely finished, spacious and clean, and the tasting menu in the restaurant was excellent. Also very reasonably priced considering the above",5,2019,09,27
226,Wonderful Stay at The Fitzwilliam Hotel,"We spent 3 wonderful nights at The Fitzwilliam Hotel.  Our room was well appointed and comfortable.  The breakfast included with the bed & breakfast rate was outstanding.  The concierge, Philip, was a valuable resource.  All the staff were very friendly & attentive.  We thoroughly enjoyed our stay at the hotel, which is very conveniently located to many of the city‚Äôs attractions, immensely.  I highly recommend The Fitzwilliam Hotel without reservation.",5,2019,09,26

226,Great hotel with excellent service!,"We stayed for 2 nights in sept 2019 and couldnt have picked a better hotel.  The rooms were spacious and the bed was very comfortable!  But the service was stellar.  Declan, the concierge, helped us with everything from restaurant choices to directions to where the locals hang out!  We were very well taken care of.  Thank you fitzwilliam hotel!!",5,2019,09,24
226,A little haven in busy belfast,Nice to relax and chill with comfy bed and good food in a well equipped room. Longer shower mats would be good for the older folküöøüòä but overall I managed. Restaurant was excellent but prefer to have wine at table. Ice in water always otherwise tepid and not tasty,5,2019,09,24
226,Quality in Belfast that's hard to beat!,"Fantastic service, rooms and food. Breakfast was excellent, the Eggs Benedict was glorious. Everything I expect from a top notch hotel. 
Overnight parking could be half the price, but 5* everything else! ",5,2019,09,23
226,fabulous weekend break,"Perfectly located for sights, tour pickups and great restaurants within a 5-10 min walk. 
Ample space in the bedroom and bathroom - good quality and sized toiletries. 
Breakfast was excellent and cocktails/ whisky flight were a nice start to an evening. 
All staff were very friendly and helpful",5,2019,09,23
226,Overnight,"We stayed at the Fitzwilliam Hotel last night to celebrate my birthday after completing the Belfast half marathon. the hotel could not have been more accommodating allowing us an early check in after the run and this allowed us time to refresh and enjoy the hotel facilities. Our room was excellent, staff gracious and extremely professional and the ambience of the hotel and room made it one of the best hotels I've stayed in anywhere in the world. Proud that it's in N Ireland
Thank you",5,2019,09,23

226,Amazing hotel,One of the most beautiful hotels in the country. You don't get service like it anywhere else either. The staff are excellent and the views of the city from the rooms are incredible! Without doubt I'll be back again soon,5,2019,09,21

226,It is beautiful,"I was lucky enough to stay here for four nights on a business trip. The hotel is beautiful with a lot of attention to detail. Had a great city view from my room.
The staff were very friendly and the breakfast was sumptuous. The price is incredibly competitive with the standard being so high. 
Definitely would stay here again.",5,2019,09,19
226,Everything you could want in a hotel!,"Great location and amazing service. Before we arrived I had been following the Fitzwilliam on social media.

226,"Beautiful hotel, I will stay there again","Loved this hotel. Even though 1 or 2 things went wrong, they're not even worth mentioning and don't take away from my 5-star rating. My room was beautiful. The tub was amazing. The bed was SO COMFORTABLE. I can't say how many hotels I've stayed at that don't have comforters, which I don't get, but their comforter was the coziest. Room service was quick and delicious, the furnishings were beautiful, the staff was incredibly friendly, helpful and kind. I got the feeling they are genuinely happy and humble people, not just nice because they're in the hospitality industry. I felt very comfortable, cozy, and cared for. I could hear the church bells from across the street, which was lovely, and there was classical music playing when I first entered my suite. The price was unbeatable, considering an Amsterdam airport hotel charged the same for their crappy hotel with a ""cabin"" instead of a room. I loved coming back to my room after a long day of sightseeing. I am definitely staying there again and would highly recommend it.",5,2019,09,17
226,Fitzwilliam Belfast,"The Fitzwilliam is a Nice hotel with a friendly staff that was recently updated and was very comfortable..Their hotel lis in a central location. We Would definitely recommend, Definitely do their afternoon high tea.",5,2019,09,17
226,5 Star Service,We all went here after a birthday celebration in Belfast last Saturday night. Had super service and great cocktail recommendations in the cocktail bar from Jacob who really made sure we all had a great night out.,5,2019,09,17
226,Bar,"Went to the bar at the Fitzwilliam for some birthday cockatils.  Was really well looked after by Jacob, one of the barmen who was able to recommend different cocktails and organise a table for us close to the music! Great night!",5,2019,09,17
226,"Location is great,Average Breakfast,Staff are friendly.","I and my partner stayed here for 3 night .
We arrived and greeted in Friday evening and welcome by the people from reception and got our room in 701 (end corner of the building )
Room:
Decent size room with a very odd design ,the tv was in the corner side of the bed and  the table was in front ,(who wants to watch tv sideways ??)the room is a bit dark in color tone ,good lighting ,tea,coffee and a kettle leaks probably need of de scaling or replace ,small fridge ,nice bed and pillow ,bathroom with all freebies (toiletries ,slipper etc )bath tub but didn‚Äôt use it but the shower and water flows well here .

We arrived here in the evening probably the housekeeping thinks it‚Äôs only one person will stay and bottled water and chocolate were provided .

Breakfast :
Staff were all ok but you have to order hot food,there is a menu and cold cuts and breads ,juices were in buffet section ,if you are into Irish or English breakfast this is good or if you prefer cereals or fruits and bread with jams or cold cuts then it‚Äôs ok too.

The hotel entrance is not in the front road  but side corner of the street ,staff are welcoming and lobby is just simple as it‚Äôs hard to say if this is 5 star but I guess ,travelling to different corners of the world  and stayed to 5 to 7 star hotels we can probably compare it to what we might expect ,but it‚Äôs ok as the location is near to city centre if you are into walking and the hop on hop bus is just across the street or go to the centre (btw there are different hop on hop off so be sure what company you will take) ,lots of restaurant nearby to choose and we were not able to eat in the restaurant here because of our choices outside (Thai ,Chinese ,Italian or Mediterranean,Etc).the hotel is also near the bus station if you are travelling via George Best Airport.

It‚Äôs a nice hotel ,good location and stay but Its doesn't validate a 5 star hotel in my view.",4,2019,09,16
226,Tops again in Belfast!,"This is the second time we've stayed at the Fitzwilliam, and we will definitely return. This hotel and staff exude excellence and the epitome of warm hospitality. We had great advice on the best whisky to sample (Sexton's my favorite), and which appetizers (don't miss the duck parfait). The soups were excellent. The staff are professional, helpful and fun. A fire alarm sounded briefly while we were in the bar and all hands turned out instantly, and the mishap was handled and we were informed immediately. Very professional and reassuring. We'll be back.",5,2019,09,16
226,Great hotel and lives up to expectation which wi rae these days,"I stay here once a month and wouldn't stay anywhere else . The service and attention to detail sis great and puts many london hotels to shame.
My one bug bear is that the rooms can be a little noisy from the ambulance sirens as its on  en route to major hospital - not much the hotel can do about that  to be fair . The break fast is excellent and the  rooms are very comfortable . I like that there is a bath and a large walk in shower in the exec rooms just want you want when staying a bit longer than a couple of nights",5,2019,09,16
226,Great Hotel,"We stayed in the Fitzwilliam Hotek for 2 nights at the beginning of September and it was beautiful, the staff are incredibly kind and helpful. Every encounter we made with them was pleasant. Any queries we had they offered to organise tours and reservations etc which was very helpful. The room and decir was lovely. Our stay included breakfast which was really great with a nice variety to choose from, and they were every accommodation if you asked for anything not on the menu. Really positive experience.",5,2019,09,15
226,Best Location in Belfast,"We have stayed at The Fitzwilliam Hotel three times this summer. It is 2 blocks away from the Europa Bus Station- and an easy bus ride to both Belfast International, and Belfast City Airport.
The hotel is centrally located, and an easy walk to most tourist attractions. 
The rooms are spacious, and clean. We have always stayed in executive rooms - which have both a tub and a walk in shower. The water pressure is good, and the water is always nice and hot. Towels are large and fluffy. The rooms also have an ironing board and iron- a plus for those attending weddings and other parties.
The staff is always welcoming and professional. The concierge will help you in getting reservations, and guide you to major attractions in Belfast.
Both families and couples will find this hotel to be quite accommodating.",5,2019,09,14
226,Excellent,This hotel is very central for walking around Belfast. Close to all attractions.  Great local pubs within walking distance . Staff are very friendly and willing to make suggestions on what to see and places to eat,5,2019,09,14
226,Nice hotel,"The staff are what makes the Fitzwilliam a good experience. Everyone was friendly.  We ate in the bar upon arrival and were the only people there at the time, and the server was super helpful.  The registration staff were also great.",5,2019,09,12
226,Relaxing ,"After a long day of travel the late check in service was flawless. I used the car parking service and it was nice to just pull up hand the keys over and straight into the hotel. Check in was speedy and efficient. The room was spotless, quiet and incredibly comfortable. Lots of attention to detail. Check out was just as quick with an early start and no delays. ",5,2019,09,12
226,LOVELY HOTEL WITH CENTRAL LOCATION,"Very reasonable and well appointed rooms. Walked 2 blocks from station. 10 min taxi from main station. Booking was easy with many room and pay options. Front desk was particularly friendly. All in all, pleasant experience.",4,2019,09,11
226,Simply wonderful.,"I was able to book my stay by directly calling the hotel from the US. The service was fast and efficient. Ashleigh, the reservation specialist was ready and willing to offer me the best value rates available. This was completed in a timely and efficient manner. Curtis, the gentleman from the front desk was the first one who answered my call was accommodating and pleasant. Meeting him in person was even more pleasant as he was kind and helpful. The entire stay was simply wonderful, everyone made you feel special. The location is perfect. The room was clean, quiet, and well kept. Make sure to request whenever you can higher floors to appreciate the views. Thank you to the staff, I have definitely found our home in Belfast, whenever we are there.",5,2019,09,10
226,Fabulous Hotel - Great City ,"Just back from an all too brief stay in this fabulous hotel. The hotel is very centrally located - beside the Opera House, behind the City Hall and close to the shopping areas. There are plenty of restaurants and bars nearby too. 
Friendly welcome, extremely helpful staff, valet parking (for an extra charge) all served to make our stay a very pleasant comfortable and enjoyable one. 

Our room on the 7th floor was gorgeous. One of the best hotel beds I‚Äôve ever slept in and the most lovely soft pillows. 

The selection of food at breakfast was excellent though service was painfully slow. 

We wanted to do the Black Cab tour and the concierge organised for us to be picked up at the hotel by our driver which was very handy. They were also excellent at recommending places for us to visit. 

I just wish we‚Äôd been staying for more than one night and look forward to returning in the future. ",5,2019,09,09
226,Visiting friends,A beautiful five star hotel.  The staff were helpful and friendly.  The hotel is situated a short walk from the city centre. The decor is beautiful and the rooms spacious and clean. The breakfast was delicious with excellent service. It was my husbands birthday so they left a little birthday cake in our room.  We were made to feel very welcome and would definately go back again,5,2019,09,09
226,Leisure,"Great hotel and very friendly, would recommend to anyone wanting to stay in Belfast city centre. Staff very helpful with car parking queries and local places to go to eat. Excellent service and breakfast was well worth it.",5,2019,09,09
226,Unfriendly welcome from the get go,"I don't really know where to begin but when you are genuinely happy and looking forward to a trip away from home for the evening, to be feel so unwelcomed by the front desk.

We were welcomed by a woman in training who was very nice and professional and explained everything to us in relation to breakfast, local information etc. When she asked for our card details, we did not travel with a card due to leaving the card at home with the partners Mother who was looking after our 3 children and in case she needed the card for an emergency, however, we did travel with enough cash for a full weekend and our Id's despite only staying for one evening. 

The woman in training got her supervisor who rudely and apruptly stated that it was hotel policy not to let us in our room without our bank cards. I explained that we received a confirmation from the hotel with our information but with no external links or information on hotel policy, where he then stated it was on the website.

I refer you all to the policy's of this hotel:

fitzwilliamhotelbelfast.com  /privacy-policy/

This is just a privacy statement online keeping in regulations of the GDPR and explains how they use and collect your data online. It does NOT state that certain information will be asked for when checking in. 

When I explained this to the Gentleman at reception, that we was not told to bring a bank card or even states it on the website in relation to check in procedures, he went on to explain that our stay was complimentary (as we had won a competition with Visit Belfast (despite me not understanding why our stay being complimentary had anything to do with the situation in hand??)). 

He finally and begrudgingly, took a copy of my partners passport and handed us the room key. It completely ruined our check in experience at this hotel, we was even worried about asking front desk for any other information because of how much of an inconvenience we was made out to be. 

On a better note, Brian, the Assistant Manager of the Bar was a true professional. As a Bar & Restaurant Manager myself for a 4* Hotel situated in The Grand Canal Dock area in Dublin, it was good to be able to meet a fellow professional in the industry. His staff was also very well trained in mixology and not shy to hold a conversation and very knowledgeable when it came to beverages. Brian and his team were an absolute credit to the hotel and I wish them all the best of luck in the future. 

The rooms themselves are 5* rooms, we did stay on the 9th floor in a suite so I cannot talk about executive or family rooms but the room we stayed in was very good and the bed itself made for a very good night's sleep. 

I wish I could put this review as 5 stars but with the awful welcome that we received from the gentleman on the front desk, and his lack of empathy and understanding, I just hope that this is addressed with the gentleman in question, so that others who travel under the same circumstances as me and my partner did, do not arise with them with the front desk staff when checking in. 
",3,2019,09,07
226,A wonderful experience,The Fitzwilliam is a beautiful hotel in an ideal location for visiting Belfast. Everything about the hotel is quality.  Would recommend the guided walking tour of the city highlighting the history of NI and 'The Troubles'.  The Titanic Museum is also a must on your list to visit.,5,2019,09,07
226,Excellent Stay,"Extremely comfortable rooms, was a treat for my mum's birthday and they left a dessert in the room with happy birthday written on it which was a really lovely touch, also the guy at the desk wished her a happy birthday upon arrival without either of us having mentioned the occasion in person, thought this was a nice touch, made my mum feel special.Its not an easy job working with the public day in,day out but the staff here were all very polite and seemed genuine in their service, special mention to the lovely girl who took our order at breakfast. I had the best nights sleep here, such a comfy bed, we had superior twin room, plenty of space, comfy setee and use of bath and a shower.  Loved the classical music playing on the radio upon our arrival. Also used the concierge valet service, really handy and efficient, my only mistake was thinking that valet meant the car would also be cleaned, totally my mistake though, it is a parking service only. Overall great stay and would highly recommend.",5,2019,09,07
226,A Wonderful Stay,We just spent three lovely nights at the Fitzwilliam Hotel in Belfast. The reception staff and concierge were superb. Liam‚Äôs bright smile and easy going personality made us feel like family. Everyone did their utmost best to make our stay as comfortable as possible. The rooms were nicely appointed and the bed was very comfortable. The Fitzwilliam is centrally located making it convenient for walking. ,5,2019,09,06
226,Great service,"Attended the Sip & Style event last night at The Fitzwilliam. Service was superb from beginning to end. Beth looked after us last night. Very attentive, checked on us if we needed more drinks and was a friendly face. All the other staff were great and looked after all guests. Fabulous evening and excellent hotel. ",5,2019,09,06
226,Nice stay,"We stayed for 1 night in a family room in the Fitzwilliam hotel, the room was fine, clean and nicely presented. We had heard so many good reviews about the hotel we were really looking forward to staying. We paid ¬£400 for the night (no breakfast included) via their official website which included a double bed and a fold out couch (for a family of 4) and it was ok (room wasn‚Äôt big, barley any walking room between the two beds) I would not be in a hurry returning. Staff were friendly and very courteous, food was nice, just for the price it was under whelming.",3,2019,09,05
226,"Perfection. Yep, really.","I could not think of a single fault with the Fitzwilliam, seriously. The attention to detail and guest experience is excellent. My room was immaculate; not a thing out of place and incredible quality (9th floor, they are new-ish). Staff were all delightful. Well done everyone.",5,2019,09,05
226,Awesome stay and lovely bed,Great evening at the hotel - perfect location to Dinner at Dean's Eipic. Lovely comfy bed and fantastic service. Would recommend to anyone to stay. Especially if you're looking for something a bit special.,5,2019,09,05
226,Perfect Hotel,"We stayed in the Fitzwilliam for 5 nights and it was a perfect way to end our holiday. It is less than 10 minutes walk to the centre of Belfast‚Äôs Shopping area. If you are doing a day tour for Game of thrones or the Giants Causeway they pick up just around the back of the Grand Opera House on Glengall street which is next door...again perfect. 

The room was amazing and we had a slight view of the church, we thought the chiming of the bells would wake us but it didn‚Äôt start until 9 and was actually quite pleasant to wake up to.

Turn down service on an evening was lovely and very well thought out, they leave chocolates and a bottle of water each by your bedside table.

They really do go the extra mile to make sure your stay of perfect, on our departure date we ordered some hot drinks in reception and was later greeted by staff apologising that the drinks were not as hot as they would of liked to be serving them and were therefore complimentary.

We will definitely be back!

226,Impeccable luxury hotel in the heart of Belfast,"From the evening treats, slippers, really comfortable pillows and bedding, to the contemporary window seats in each room, the Fitzwilliam is first class all the way. Modern decor yet warm in spirit.  Impeccable service. Excellent location.",5,2019,09,04
226,"Excellent hotel, top quality room","Very comfortable room, spotlessly clean, great food. All in all what you want from a hotel. It has the added benefit of being close to the centre of the city which is really helpful. Great for transport links to and from the airport.",5,2019,09,04
226,Last minute night out,"Great service, valet parking is a must. Lovely attentive staff, brilliant cocktails from knowledgeable bar staff. We have stayed before but the renovations to the rooms are great, we had a great view over the city too.  Whats not so good are the tiny towels and the poor breakfast staff and buffet.",4,2019,09,04
226,Great hotel!,Stayed here with my partner and we both loved it! The hotel is very modern and the decor is gorgeous. Beautiful hotel. All staff are very professional and friendly. Will definitely stay here again. Thanks,5,2019,09,03
226,Amazing refreshing stay,"Have just stayed here for our wedding anniversary. We had a corner room which was absolutely amazing. Staff were extremely helpful and so warm and welcoming. Such a handy location right in the centre, but be warned - you won't want to leave the gorgeous room!! So amazing looking out over the city, especially in the evening with the lights on.
Thank you also for the amazing little treats left in for us, such a nice touch.
We're already planning another stay!
Only constructive thing I could suggest is maybe having smartTV access on the television would be an added bonus, and perhaps unlocking the minibar before guests arrive. Neither a major issue though. 
Honestly such an amazing stay, thank you so much and absolutely can't wait to return!",5,2019,09,03
226,Evening meal time to kill.,"Haven't been to the Fitzwilliam in few years, decided to book evening meal as had a few hours to kill.
Was greeted by Anna at the doors with warm welcome. 
I had ordered the lamb which was somewhat disappointing ¬£24 for two fatty medallions bit over priced. I only had a few bites of actual chewy meat.
I was then presented with a crab claw with looked shockingly scary. Not my sort of thing at all. 

The menu was quite pricey not that I mind that sort of thing but portions a little stingey to be fair. 

The place could do with a big face lift as it's gloomy and depressing as I remember it. 

Lovely service by Anna, who always gives a warm and welcoming experience. 

Get a revamp Fitz!!!",3,2019,09,03
226,Great hotel!,"Great hospitality, food and rooms. Could not fault it sand would definitely stay again. Breakfast was amazing. Dinner was very good quality and fairly priced. Staff are friendly and welcoming. Overall, a great experience. Close to city centre and local amenities.",5,2019,09,03
226,"Good and bad, but mostly good.","Good:
The location is very convenient
Could not fault the room, loads of lovely little touches, and spotless
Nice quiet sleep despite the busy location.
Bar food very good.   Brian in the bar was great.
Breakfast - very good, nice service from the staff.
Housekeeping did a marvelous job.

Not so good:
Foyer is very disappointing, not a place we liked to linger. Not 5 star.
The bar is nice but the booths are very squashed
Very limited parking in the staff car park and must be pre booked.  To access the car, you must be accompanied by staff.
The man in reception who gave me a tripadvisor card with his name on it and asked for a mention.  I would have, if I though he was worth a mention! 
The two doormen when we were leaving having a personal chat and completely ignored us as we departed.

There was a slight air of snootiness from some staff, based I guess on the star rating.   It was a little unnerving and that annoys me.  A really decent hotel does not need to be snooty.   Overall though, I'd go back, for the good stuff above,",4,2019,09,03
226,leisure stay,"found the hotel to be over priced for what it is 
the reception staff were lovely on the desk 
as were the dinning room staff 
food was just ok 

just found the stay quite boring their choice of music wasn't great 
and they had an very loud hen party in which ruined the evening and I was quite surprised they allowed    they tried to make excuses for them saying they didn't say they were a hen party when they booked !!",3,2019,09,02
226,Perfect weekend,"Came here with hubby for the weekend and had a pleasant stay.  I have arranged the black cab tour and coach tour to Giant Causeway with the concierge prior to our stay.  They were extremely professional.  Despite arriving before check in time, we were able to grab a room.  Got confirmation of all our bookings with concierge which was icing on the cake.

Our room was on the second floor, with a view of a tiny courtyard.  The room is therefore quite dark without the sunshine which is such a shame.

Room was compact but very comfortable.  No issues.  Got turndown service on Friday night, but not Saturday, weird!

Tried out the bar of Sat night, staff was extremely pleasant, just perfect and very knowledgeable about local brew!  

The hotel is perfectly located and a short distance away from the coach tour and bus station.  Perfect.

Superb stay and perfect customer service.",4,2019,09,02

Breakfast is as ever wonderful with a great selection available. Room was luxurious + the bed so comfortable. Facilities in the room are excellent.,5,2019,09,01
226,Faultless and then some,Brilliant brilliant hotel. Service exemplary throughout; checkin/out; housekeeping and concierge. We had to move rooms (not the hotel‚Äôs fault) Done without a quibble. Service really is first class. Rooms well appointed and very clean. Corner rooms fantastic with great views. Location a 1 min stroll to the centre. It‚Äôs on a main road so there is inevitable traffic noise so take ear plugs if a light sleeper. Faultless Fitz and then some...,5,2019,09,01
226,Great service!,"This hotel is well located, clean and comfortable.  What blew us away was the service, especially the front desk.  They helped us book tours and gave advice and were just so very welcoming.  We were there for two nights in July 2019.  I would highly recommend this hotel if you are visiting Belfast.",5,2019,08,31

Highly recommended",5,2019,08,30
226,Well located and Comfortable,"Our room was spacious and well serviced. Staff were very helpful.  Wifi was super fast. We used the on-site valet parking at ¬£25 a day - expensive but handy.

As soon as we arrived the reception wished my daughter a happy birthday which gave the stay a more personal touch. Our room was lovely and little touches such as playing cards and mini bar and decent sized wardrobe for those staying longer were great touches. We made use of the bar for dinner and the service was faultless and friendly. in fact any staff you came into contact with were friendly and helpful. Especially liked when turn down service was offered in the evening you were given a box each,  containing chocolates.It's ideally located to for the shops and restaurants and a short walk from the bus centre which is great for transfers to the airport and much cheaper than a taxi. Would definitely stay here again and happily recommend",5,2019,08,29
226,Night Away in Lovely Hotel,"Stayed 1 night at the Fitzwilliam Hotel, Excellent hotel, great service and very comfortable. We could smell cigarette smoke in the room when we first arrived, rang reception and we were immediately moved and the Concierge was very apologetic. Great location. Will stay here again.",5,2019,08,29
226,Many thanks to the Fitzwilliam,We had a very pleasant stay at the Fitzwilliam. The staff was terrific and very helpful. We had originally booked a highly rated B&B in Belfast for the week of the Open which turned out to be terrible. The folks at the Fitzwilliam desk assured us that we would be happy at their hotel. I would like to say thank you to the Hotel and staff for saving us from a bad situation. Everything that they promised they delivered! ,5,2019,08,29

226,Pure luxury,"Myself and my partner stayed at the fitzwilliam for one night and I enjoyed every second of it. The attention to detail with house keeping, down time, cleanliness excellence, customer service and the style of the hotel made me never want to leave. 100% recommend. I especially liked how when I came back from sightseeing with my partner they had been in the room to pull the curtains, left robes & slippers on either side of the bed, placed little chocolate truffles on our pillows, gave us both a bottle of water each with a glass on either bedside table and all the information needed to organise room service breakfast which was also top of the line. The reception staff are so friendly and go above and beyond to make your stay as easy and enjoyable as possible by directing you where the shopping areas are such as Victoria square mall etc. The fitzwilliam less than a 1 minute walk from the Europa bus station and is right in the heart of Belfast so all the shopping streets, bars & restaurants  are within walking distance.

226,Long weekend in Belfast staying at the Fitzwilliam Hotel,"We enjoyed a long weekend to celebrate our wedding anniversary at the Fitzwilliam Hotel. We both really enjoyed our stay which we can recommend to everyone who enjoys being in the centre of Belfast and close to all the attractions. The hotel is very welcoming and all staff are cheerful and polite to everyone which we loved to have a chat to and hear their recommendations.
The hotel is spotlessly clean and comfortable. Rooms are luxurious and well provided for. The quality of the food is exceptional and we looked forward to eating at the restaurant for breakfast and dinner which was delicious. Than k you also for our anniversary card and cake delivered to our room.

 There is so much to see and do in Belfast and can recommend Crumlin gaol, Titanic tour and museum, black taxi cab to visit the site of the troubles, driving up to the Antrim Coast to visit Giants causeway, the rope bridge, Ballycastle, Ballytoy to see the locations of the Game of Thrones, Bushmills distillery and finally Stormont which was beautiful.

226,"Posh, nice amenities but....","Has the feel of needing a bit of DIY.... painting, repairing, update of decor.   There were dings here and there. 

The decor was VERY dark, which I didn‚Äôt care for.  Dark walls. Hallway was dark with subdued lighting.  The one bright spot was the lavender colored couch, and the real orchid in a vase.  See pics.  

They provided all the amenities needed:  soap, shampoo, lotions, stationary, a deck of playing cards,even a votive candle to light while you‚Äôre taking a bath.  Beds were comfortable.   

Front desk staff was efficient.  When we arrived, our room had two single beds and we‚Äôd booked a king bed. We called the front desk and two housekeepers came within 5 minutes to efficiently put the two beds into one.  ",4,2019,08,25

226,Short stay,"Ideally situated in the middle of Belfast, friendly knowledgeable staff, a well presented and clean hotel, food excellent, overall it was a great experience. however, and sadly there is always a however, we telephoned for an early check in and after being advised this was ok, no availability of a room meant it was after 14.00 hours before we could access our room, we arrived at 08.30 after an early morning flight, but other that that little hick up, no issues, and the staff were most apologetic. ",5,2019,08,22
226,"Location, servic, hospitality and a wonderful warm welcome","From the moment we arrived in Belfast we were struck by the warmth of every one we met. Never more so than at The Fitzwilliam. Great central location, helpful reception staff, excellent concierge service, lovely bar staff. Their advice and suggestions on places to go, where to eat and the best bars and getting around made our short break even more fulfilling. We will defintely be visiting this super little city, and wonderful hotel, again",5,2019,08,20
226,Not five star,"Nicely designer furniture pieces on ground floor lobby, the rooms are clean and efficient, the head cincierge was very good but that‚Äôs were the good news stops... This is a soulless hotel, staff have no character you are treated like a number not a human being, generally unfriendly, breakfast is poor and mean, small unloved gym, it is not a five star hotel in terms of service and they just don‚Äôt care...",2,2019,08,20
226,Great Hotel,The hotel and staff were wonderful at the hotel. Our room overlooked the city with an all glass view. Concierge was very helpful. I would stay with them again. Buffet breakfast was one of the best in he city.,5,2019,08,19
226,What a beautiful hotel,"What can I say , our experience was second to none , from the perfect location, the most wonderful , kind , helpful friendly staff who went above and beyond, not to mention how luxurious the hotel , most definitely 5 + star ",5,2019,08,19
226,Below expectations.,"Business stay,  and was not quite room as I expected. But was so clean and location was excellent. Breakfast not very option to select from. No parking at the hotel mostly full and you have to go and park the car other location 5 mins walking to the hotel and costly. ",3,2019,08,19
226,STAY HERE!!,"Everything from arrival to check out was perfect. The staff are among the friendliest I‚Äôve ever come across, the rooms are amazing, the food is incredible. The atmosphere of the bar and restaurant is also fantastic. Stay here if you plan a trip to Belfast!",5,2019,08,19
226,a very good room,"Excellent room, sleeping, and general comfort.
The breakfast was a little dissapointing: bacon and scrambled eggs had obviously been waiting for a long time, they were dry and without taste. But what we will remember is the very efficient and friendly concierge",5,2019,08,19
226,5 star service,"Beautiful hotel for a night away, staff are what make is special.
Grab some cocktails in the bar before dinner, great atmosphere was live music when we wee there. Very comfortable rooms, nicely decorated. Great food in the restaurant.",5,2019,08,18
226,Weekend away ,"We are staying in the hotel this weekend. The location is very good and the experience is very nice . We were upgraded to a very nice room on the 5th floor which over looks the jury‚Äôs hotel across the road. So no view but we are in the city. The bar in the hotel is very good with live music  and nice cocktails. The staff especially the bar manager was very attentive and made us feel very special. We booked a table in the main restaurant for the tasting menu which was very good unfortunately the service was very poor for what a five star hotel restaurant should be. We spoke to the manager with a poor response for a bill well over ¬£100 for two people. Overall the hotel is very good ,room great comfy beds and well worth booking. Do not bother going to the main restaurant as the experience for the cost is not good there are numerous good restaurants very near by which are much better for the same cost.
This hotel is close to the centre and well worth a visit. Except the restaurant.

226,Short visit to Belfast,The Fitzwilliam Hotel was an excellent location for our visit to Belfast. The staff were most helpful and friendly. We would recommend to others.  I am now using words to fill up the 200 word requirement. .,5,2019,08,17
226,Clean and Comfortable,"Nice check-i n experience.  Room was ready even though we arrived early.  Staff was efficient and friendly.  Room was spacious, clean and comfortable.  Located centrally in Belfast, close to shops and restaurants.",4,2019,08,17

226,Exceptional,"Beautiful hotel in a fantastic location. Rooms were big and very comfortable.  We were there to celebrate my husbands birthday. The  hotel provided pastries in our room to help us celebrate. Nice touch. Staff are warm and helpful in particular Simon on reception and concierge Nigel. Not a great experience in the resturant for dinner. I had to return my steak as it was spongy and very hard to chew. It was replaced immediately. I felt the resturant decor itself was not conducive to an intimate evening dinner but ok for breakfast. Great continental choice for breakfast with a Gluten free station as well,  Cooked  breakfast. to order. Lovely.",5,2019,08,15
226,Just gorgeous & perfect location!,"I have stayed here 3 times now so thought I‚Äôd better leave a review!!
We just love this hotel. It‚Äôs very modern with a beautiful pink grey & rose gold colour scheme. The rooms are stunning as is the lobby lounge area. Very luxurious & tastefully done. 
Lots of little touches all thought of in the room. There‚Äôs a box which contains mints, ear plugs, playing cards menus, but really beautifully presented.
Bathroom is stunning with a bath & walk in shower. They even give you matches so you can light the candle whilst enjoying a bath. Lovely products too.
Really good sound system in the room & excellent sound proofing! We didn‚Äôt hear a peep from anyone!
All the staff were so friendly & accommodating, we even got our bags carried to our room. I felt so guilty though as didn‚Äôt have any cash on us to tip which I definitely would have üò¨üò¨
We had a bite to eat in the bar which again is really lovely & huge selection of drinks. They had gluten free & vegan options too.
When we went back upstairs, our bed had been turned down for the evening!! Loved this touch! Chocolates on the pillow too!
Breakfast costs ¬£15 if you book in advance but definitely worth it. High quality & lots of choice. They even cooked me a special gluten free vegan cooked breakfast! We will absolutely stay here again and right across the road from Fibber Maggies & The Old Crown inn, a must visit if I‚Äôm Belfast!! 100% warrants it‚Äôs 5 star rating & we felt the prices in the bar etc were very reasonable for a city high end 5 star hotel. Some people were having afternoon tea in the lobby which looked incredible & on querying they could even do this gluten free & vegan so will be trying on my next visit. Thank you to all the staff for making our stay wonderful! ",5,2019,08,14
226,Wonderful stay. ,"We stayed 3 nights in this hotel. All the time the device was top notch. Very personal approach by the friendly staff. A special note should be point out to waiter Mister Grant who served us with great care during breakfast. Absolutely well done. 
The housekeeping was attentive and took great care of the room. Around 6 pm they will come to the room to prepare our room for the night and treat us with chocolate. 
The location of the hotel is excellent. All the shopping areas is within 5-10 minutes walking distance. Enough restaurants in the surroundings. ",5,2019,08,14
226,Overnight treat mum and daughter,"Hotel is luxurious, room sport on.
Only negative feedback, service in the restaurant wasn't great.  My daughter and I waited 20 mins for someone to approach us , we where left with no offer of water of drinks order.
At breakfast the wrong order was brought.  Several guests had to leave there seats and approach staff to get some attention .
Not the best for a 5 star hotel.  The saving grace of the stay was the food, compliments to the chef, well done, excellent food..",5,2019,08,14
226,Great friendly city hotel,Great friendly city hotel close to everything you'd need. Staff couldn't be more helpful from taking cases to our room to printing off boarding cards. The food was very good and again restaurant staff delightful. I would strongly recommend and we'll definitely be back! ,5,2019,08,14
226,Birthday surprise ,"My boyfriend and I stayed here on Sunday night for my birthday! 2nd time visiting here and loved it once again! Really helpful staff at reception, gorgeous room and comfy bed! Love the bar area too as it is cosy and private to enjoy a few cocktails! Hope to return in the near future and would highly recommend! ",5,2019,08,13
226,The Fitzwilliam Hotel,"The Fitzwilliam Hotel 
We stayed here for our 30th wedding anniversary and found the staff, accommodation and food outstanding, would gladly give this hotel 6stars if we could.... highly recommend it the attention to detail was fantastic very impressed by the friendly staff and very clean.",5,2019,08,13
226,Great Experience,"Friendly, helpful staff. Excellent breakfast, best range we have ever seen offered. Lovely clean room, well supplied with water and other complimentary refreshments. Comfortable beds. Highly recommend ",5,2019,08,12
226,Poor service,"Not worth the cost, splashed out on luxury, got less than that, the adjoinging rooms door couldn't be opened the 1st night, slow & cold breakfast on the 2nd day (25 mins for toast?), misleading website with regards to how many children can sleep in a family room",2,2019,08,12
226,Great hotel ,"A lovely hotel in the middle of the city. Great to valet parking. Our room was ready early when we arrived which was so handy. A lovely spacious room with nice bathroom. The bathroom lacked space to put make up and toiletries. Small negative. Had to leave them on the floor. 
Lovely large comfy bed. I feel If we had been on a higher floor the outside noise night have been less. 
Had dinner in the restaurant. Part of my husbands main course didn‚Äôt arrive so they complimented our wine. It‚Äôs was very generous of them . Nice food. Breakfast was excellent both morning. Service very slow on the Sunday. Staff were so friendly and went out of their way to accommodate. Would stay here again. Great location. With a few tweeks in service would make a difference. Loved our fees days away. ",5,2019,08,11
226,Fabulous,"Fantastic night in hotel, everything from checking in to the checking out was perfect. Staff so friendly and helpful. Bed was amazing !!! View from suite was super over Belfast. Highly recommended as a treat",5,2019,08,11
226,Excellent hotel,Everything you expect from a five star along with the extra little touches. Everything was perfect from arivai to leaving even a couple of bottles of water left in car for homeward journey. Service at dinner and breakfast first class staff very atentavie.,5,2019,08,11
226,Would recommend this hotel,"We had a great stay and would happily return if ever in Belfast again. Rooms were very comfortable, had too many details to list and the location could not have been better. The Friday night happy hour in the lounge was excellent. Would be nice if they offered this on more days as the cocktails were delicious.  The staff could not have been nicer or more accommodating. The attention to detail and commitment to service did not go unnoticed. Thank you. ",5,2019,08,10
226,Choose this hotel,"If you are unsure which Hotel to stay I can reccomend this one.  It‚Äôs central but peaceful and relaxing, the staff are lovely and the rooms luxurious.  Extras such as chocolates,bathrobes,tealight in bathroom made us feel pampered. We had previously stayed in Europa Hotel which was terrible compared to the Fitzwilliam.",5,2019,08,10
226,"Friendly, Stylish, and Elegant","We spent three nights here and found the staff to be top notch and the room to be comfortable and well equipped.  Breakfast as a bit understaffed one day, as they were slammed with everyone arriving at once, but they carried on with smiles on their faces.  We enjoyed chatting with the doorman and hearing many stories about Belfast.  We hope to be back.",5,2019,08,07
226,Fantastic!,"We had a fantastic 2 night stay at The Fitzwilliam. Great location and the staff were very personable and engaging especially for a larger Hotel. The General Manager defintiley knows what he is doing...We enjoyed breakfast and the morning manager Sarah Louise was  incredibly friendly and professional. The room was spacious and bed,towels and linens were of very good quality. The Concierge staff were very helpful with any questions like directions of restaurant recommendations..Would not hesitate to recommend the Fitzwilliam when staying in Belfast.",5,2019,08,07
226,Fabulous Stay,"I knew the hotel would be nice but I was really blown away at the comfort, design, cleanliness, breakfast and friendliness of the staff.
We stayed in an Executive room and it was gorgeous and so so comfortable, as well as spotless!  I had gotten a fantastic rate through a direct booking on their website and it include a wonderful breakfast with all the trimmings.
The hotel is also smack bang in the middle of everything so a great location for checking out the city.

I would only have a couple of negatives; 
1. The Church across road started their bells at 9am with a very very long piece, fine if you're up early but if you fancied a lie-in there is no chance (this was  Monday morning), obviously the hotel can't control this. 
2. The parking in general in Belfast seems to be astronomically expensive for an overnight, and I was very disappointed to see that it was not included as hotel guests, the supposed reduced rate of ¬£25 for guests is a serious additional charge on top of your stay and has to be booked in advance.  I wasn't aware of this and so the hotel couldn't give us parking.
However, we went to the train station parking lot next door as recommended by reception and with a validated ticket we got this for ¬£12 overnight which is far more reasonable (but unless someone tells you about it you would pay ¬£28) o it worked out better for us anyways. Just something to bare in mind when booking any hotel in the city!",5,2019,08,07
226,Not as good as we had hoped,"We spent a Sunday night at the hotel on their special summer package with our daughter, which included dinner (for adults only), breakfast for all and two cocktail vouchers worth ¬£9 each.  

We used the pre-booked ¬£25 valet parking.  Check in easy and professional with appreciated early access to our room.  We found the family room nicely appointed (minus the uncomfortable pillows) but somewhat cramped with the sofabed facing the bed.  There was a spacious bathroom with separate bath and shower containing a good selection of toiletries.  There was no ""view"" from our room but that didn't bother us.  

Dinner food was good and service pleasant and professional, but all diners were seated in one contained section of the restaurant.  A very large group of overseas tourists on two tables were seated at the same time in the middle of the section.  Thankfully they were not noisy but there is no doubt a little slow service at times (particularly drinks arriving after the starter) were impacted by this.  We were not asked if we wanted a second drink during dinner.  We felt we should have been offered another time or moved to another section of the restaurant.  Dessert left untouched - our daughter didn't care for the bitter chocolate - but noone asked why.  

The Bar was our biggest let down.  We chose to sit in one of the booths that was a bit of a squeeze to get in and out of.  Unfortunately the mature couple next to use kept playing various music videos to each other at considerable volume.  They were closer to the bar than us, but no member of staff approached them to consider other guests.  We asked if we could use our cocktail vouchers for another drink that cost LESS than the cocktail.  The lovely young, but clearly inexperienced waitress. kept returning to ask the barman but he said no, although eventually allowing a gin and tonic but only if we had schweppes and not fever tree as we asked (and was still cheaper than the classic cocktails allowed).  My husband decided the situation was so ridiculous that he asked for the barman to come over.  Suddenly there was no problem and the barman was exceptionally nice thereafter.  Madness.  The bar area wasn't as ""plush"" and comfortable as we have experienced in other 4/5 star hotels and would be a reason not to return.  The whole point of choosing the hotel, was so we could enjoy dinner and drinks without having to leave the hotel in the evening.

All in all we had a nice stay and an interesting first visit to Belfast.  Living only two hours away, we could return, but honestly not sure for a +¬£400 spend for one night we could justify this hotel again.",4,2019,08,07
226,"Never disappoints, fabulous!","Excellent from start to finish, warm, friendly, stunning room, close to all amenities , staff were so friendly and nothing was too much trouble - excellent breakfast , I couldn't fault the hotel at all ! Cannot wait to return. ",5,2019,08,06
226,Fabulous ,"I had a work trip to Belfast and spent 2 nights at the Fitzwilliam.  From the minute I got there until I left. I have to say the staff were just incredible.  Nothing was too big a deal,  they really do make a huge effort with guests

My room was lovely,  great sized bathroom,  robe and slippers.  I had a small breakfast each morn,  but the selection was great.  I ate dinner one night in the bar. Delicious 

Drinks were reasonably priced and the location of this hotel is spot on. 

Will definitely be back",5,2019,08,06
226,3 days pre-wedding stay,"Another comfortable stay at the Fitz, which we have frequented many times. Breakfast was plentiful although there were issues with the loose leaf tea strainer! That said, the staff there are welcoming and friendly.
We had hoped that my elderly parents would be on our floor as requested and noted, only to find out that their room was not, plus they had an adjoining door. Luckily my father is hard of hearing, so they weren‚Äôt disturbed.
We had a few wedding guests staying at the hotel too prior to heading for our wedding in Ballymena.",4,2019,08,06
226,Return visit 3 nights for pride,My partner and I have stayed many times at this hotel less recently since they had there renovations. We used to all ways book the studio suites those rooms where outstanding. We booked the old converted studio suite rooms they are now called signature city view rooms. I wish they hadn‚Äôt ever been greedy and took those rooms away as it‚Äôs lost it‚Äôs wow factor. We had a issue with the aircon on arrival it wasn‚Äôt working. We called down and asked for a fan and where presented with a fan that I wouldn‚Äôt expect for a 5* hotel it was filthy and smelled the room was stuffy and warm. We asked for maintenance people to look at it and we where sent the concierge. This poor guy had fixed other issues for us when we asked downstairs he explained he was jack of all trades after hours. He fixed the room temperature down for us we had set it all day at 18 degrees but I know how cold that should have been and it wasn‚Äôt. I just feel standards in the hotel have slipped not as good products and furniture and carpets where tired it was coming away from the wall in the room. Room was tiny it wasn‚Äôt worth it for the so called signature view. To be honest the staff are what makes this hotel amazing anything isn‚Äôt a trouble. 2/3 mornings however they got our breakfast wrong I knew they where busy but wouldn‚Äôt have expected that and the standard or service isn‚Äôt what I‚Äôm used too in 5* hotels. I‚Äôm sad to say but I won‚Äôt be booking the fitzwillam again after spending three nights there it‚Äôs just not the same standard as other 4* and 5* hotels in the city. Be warned it‚Äôs ¬£25 a night to park your car which is ridiculous. The staff in my eyes are what‚Äôs keeping this hotel going. The afternoon tea was lovely can‚Äôt fault that in any shape or form!,3,2019,08,05
226,Great hotel,"This hotel is probably too nice to stay for a quick trip as the City is fantastic with so much to see and do you don't spend enough time there.
The room was excellent, everything you'd expect, TV on the small size but we weren't there to watch it! Bath is huge and everything was spotless. 
The bar area is really relaxed, there was a live band on in there on the Friday early evening.
We opted for the breakfast and werent disappointed, cooked to perfection.  
The concierge were a great help to us advising us on bars, restaurants and general things to do.
Overall this was one up there with my favourite Cities to visit and the hotel was perfect!",5,2019,08,04
226,Lovely place to stay in Belfast,"We stayed here our last night in Ireland.  The front desk staff were very kind and helpful.  The bar was lovely and had a great selection of food.  Our room was very luxurious and what you would expect from a 5 star hotel.  We had comfortable bathrobes, turn down service and a lovely sitting area.  You can't beat the location - right in downtown Belfast.  I would stay here again.",5,2019,08,04
226,The Open,"We had a brilliant stay in t FitzWilliam hotel during The Open. As usual the manager Cian and his staff were fantastic. My sons enjoyed t Titanic centre and we had a fabulous dinner in t hotel that evening.We had a very early start to catch t golf but the staff had our car ready and breakfast to go.
We hope to return again soon!",5,2019,08,04
226,Excellent,"Excellent service, was not disappointed the staff go above and beyond, rooms were beautiful, breakfast was outstanding lots of choices hotel has a fantastic location, definitely recommend. Belfast was a beautiful and friendly city.",5,2019,08,04
226,Excellent value,"This hotel was 5 star by every sense: service, appearance, location, room size & comfort etc. From the moment we were greeted by the concierge who took our bags, to check out & organising our parking, we couldn‚Äôt fault. It‚Äôs hard to believe the price, being similar to that of what we‚Äôve paid for 3 and 4 star hotels in other locations.
The only thing that was a little annoying was the locked fridge, but that seems to be a trend among hotels in the area. & the staff were more than happy to supply us with enough ice to keep our drinks happy.
It‚Äôs important to note that if you‚Äôre staying here with a car, you must contact prior to arriving to ensure a spot is available. We didn‚Äôt so had to park in the nearby car park...but that ended up being cheaper through the hotel anyway so was the best option in our opinion 
Highly recommended",5,2019,08,03
226,Fantastic stay!,"Super clean, modern and spacious. Lovely friendly staff. Excellent service. After briefly mentioning it was a birthday treat to the check-in staff we were surprised with a birthday card + treat of brownie + macaron in the room when we entered. Such a thoughtful touch. Breakfast has a great selection and the hot food is ordered from a menu so no soggy/gross food thats been left out under lamps for ages! Would definitely stay there again.",5,2019,08,03
226,A comfortable stay,I was looking for a comfortable hotel and room with excellent service in a central location. That‚Äôs exactly what I found. The room was comfortable and clean. The food and service excellent. The location was perfect for all I wanted.,5,2019,08,03
226,Very nice place to stay,We stayed at the Fitzwilliam on our last night in Ireland after completing the trip around the country.  The Fitzwilliam is 1 of only 2 5-star hotels in Belfast.  The rooms are very clean and comfortable.  The bar area is small but accommodating. Our room was on one of the corners with floor to ceiling windows just down from a church whose clock tower chimed on the hour.  It was very lovely. I can certainly recommend this hotel.  The staff was very courteous and attentive.  I would certainly stay there again.,5,2019,08,02
226,Outstanding five star service and value,"Highly recommend for five star service and amenities!!
Great location
Great service
Comfortable rooms
Everything you could ask for is happily done for you and you feel truly welcomed.
Bar and restaurant were awesome and food was very tasty!

Only criticism I could give is that the on-site breakfast is not so great.  Bath towels are a little small.  And shower floor is slippery but because it‚Äôs so luxurious and large the floor mat doesn‚Äôt cover the whole area so it can be a hazard.",5,2019,08,01
226,Birthday Night Break,"Excellent service. Top quality food was amazing. Room was impressive and very clean, will deffo be back.  Very good value for money for a 5 star hotel compared to others. Would recommend this hotel to everyone ",5,2019,08,01

226,The perfect package,There is not one bad thing I can say about this hotel. Rooms luxurious and super comfortable. Staff going over and beyond to help. Delicious breakfast. We've stayed in a few 5 star hotels this holiday and this one was the best,5,2019,07,29
226,Simply stunning,"Amazing stay- welcoming and friendly staff, chauffeurs were lovely and very professional, room was immaculate- comfortable with soothing music and air con on-on arrival, bathrobes and slippers and of course complimentary chocolates in the room- it‚Äôs the simple things that mean the most!

All our guests, staffs were satisfied during staying the hotel. If there is any chance, we will book again your hotel ",4,2019,07,25
226,Beautiful hotel in Belfast City Centre,"The check in was efficient and Stephan was helpful and friendly throughout our stay. The room was well appointed-nice bed, amazing coffee service including a french press, nice amenities. The room was quiet yet overlooked the city. The staff and service was exceptional.

However, do NOT travel to Belfast over July 11th evening to July 12th. It is holiday celebrating William of Orange and there were burning pyres throughout the city, falling down drunks and parades. The front desk warned us that this is something that tourists shouldn't see and to stay inside. It was incredibly disturbing to see people burning photos of the Sein Fenn M.P. and the flag of the Republic. It was unsettling.",5,2019,07,24
226,Jewel in Belfast ,"I stay in luxury hotels all over the world but this is the first time I have given a 5/5
From the second I pulled up and the concierge parked my car at no extra charge and was greeted by the professionals on reception I was blown away.
This place is immaculate and every member of staff I‚Äôve met has been exceptional 
That includes the hotel maintenance who came to show me how the air con worked and then asked me did I need the cleaning team to come and hoover as when checking it was working properly 2 small flakes of roof squares landed on the bathroom floor
Everything in the room has been thought from large umbrellas candle beside the bath 
Fresh coffee for the cafeti√®re the fitzwilliam box I‚Äôll let you discover that!! Magazines slippers dressing gowns great quality toiletries beautiful bed linen and accessories 
So for 2 years I‚Äôve worked up here each month really struggled to find a nice place to stay I‚Äôve now booked my next trip and I cannot wait to come back ",5,2019,07,23
226,Luxury,Best hotel we have ever stayed in and everything was perfect from the amenities of the room to the brilliant customer service I found no negatives would definitely stay again and would recommend as well. ,5,2019,07,23
226,Wish we could have stayed longer!,"My boyfriend and I were in Belfast for one night and we stayed at The Fitzwilliam upon recommendation from a family member and it did not disappoint. The hotel is easy to find from the train station and the city center and furthermore is so central everything is in walking distance. It was right before Christmas and the lobby was decorated so beautifully, it was amazing. Every single staff member we encountered was so welcoming and friendly especially the young man at reception with whom we checked in with. Our room was wonderful and the bed was so comfortable. Everyone does such a great job here, truly a fabulous place to stay if you get the chance! Well done to all! ",5,2019,07,22
226,Lovely hotel in ideal spot with great staff,My son and I only stayed the one night. 2 really well appointed rooms. Simple boutique style offering. By far the highlight was the staff. They were exceptional from arriving valet to leaving valet. Awesome.,5,2019,07,22
226,Excellent hotel,"Well situated hotel with an extremely friendly and service minded staff. The room was luxurious, clean and comfortable. Both the bar and the breakfast reastaurant was a first class experience. The Fitzwilliam Belfast is highly recommendable.",5,2019,07,22
226,Poor valet parking service and management skills,Lovely hotel and food was really nice however wouldn‚Äôt advise anyone to use the valet parking service as I believe this damage was done to my car while one of the employees were parking it. At first I was told by a manager he would look at the CCTV in his free time as he had other roles and responsibilities and was not helpful at all. Customers are expected to pay ¬£25 per night to have their car ‚Äòsafely‚Äô parked when there is no CCTV in the car park apart from one at the entrance of the car park which managers refuse to let the customers see when damage has been done to their car. Not to mention the hotel has took no liability for the damage which has been done to my car which I believe was caused by them. In the end they were willing to refund half the stay which does not even cover 1/3 of the damage done to my car which means I‚Äôm now left with a massive bill.,1,2019,07,21
226,"Great Location, Great Hotel. Reasonable Price","We stayed here for a weekend in July. The hotel is only a 10 minute taxi from the city airport. From being greeted by the doorman who immediately took our bags, the service was first class. 

We booked a package with Expedia which included flights and breakfast which was better value than booking separately. Our Executive Room was perfectly fine. We weren't particularly keen of the aspect of the first room offered so the reception staff immediately moved us to another.

The room was of course spotless and there were a lot of nice touches such as classical music playing on entry that set this hotel apart form the usual chain offer.

Our only dining in the hotel was breakfast included in the package which was of course very good with lots to choose from. I'm not sure however I would have been happy parting with ¬£25 if this was an addition.

The concierge booked our hop-on-hop-off bus tour and reception also printed our return flight boarding passes. You couldn't ask for much more.

This is a slightly more expensive option for a city centre hotel, but as a treat, we thought it was well worth it.",5,2019,07,20
226,"Wonderful location , helpful staff",Stayed two nights here beginning of July. Found this hotel in a great location and very well appointed. The staff were extremely helpful and very efficient. Would most definitely recommend this hotel to anyone staying in Belfast. ,5,2019,07,19
226,Simply The Best!,"The staff, the room, and the breakfast was simply the best we have ever experienced! This was hands down the best and most memorable stay we have ever had. From the friendliness of the entire staff, to the extremely comfortable room, and the best breakfast, The Fitzwilliam will be hard to ever top in our travels! We hope to return again in the future! ",5,2019,07,19
226,A fantastic hotel,"My overall rating for this traditional hotel is just perfect: starting with the wonderful design, the perfectly clean rooms, the warm atmosphere which is just everywhere. But one thing that is just outstanding and I want to highlight here: I have rarely met so many warm hearted people, doesn‚Äôt mater it is the Concierge, the people working at the reception, in the restaurant or making your bed in the evening. I felt like being part of a family. Thanks for everything! ",5,2019,07,19
226,Absolutely amazing!!,This is not my first stay at The Fitzwiliam Hotel and I was definitely not disappointed. The Hotel was immaculate as usual and the room was even better!! I will definitely be back for another stay at some point!! ,5,2019,07,19
226,Outstanding Service Levels,"Service levels at the hotel were consistently outstanding, from reception, dining to concierge. The staff are so friendly (this being typical of the Irish of course) but they really are so hospitable. ",5,2019,07,19
226,First class hotel in Belfast,"Stayed for two nights in July.Arrived early 8.30 in the morning expect to leave our bags, we were welcomed by super friendly staff who checked us into room 811 straight away. Concierge provided lots of information  on how to get around the city and what to see. Afternoon  tea is a must and worth every penny,Brian looked after us and nothing was a problem super nice guy. We had a great meal in the restaurant worth every penny and well looked after by Grant. Well done to everyone at the Fitzwilliam, will definitely return. 5 stars",5,2019,07,18
226,Fantastic Hotel ,Have stayed here twice in the past and both times have been great. The decor and layout of the hotel is very sleek and sophisticated and all the staff are extremely attentive and welcoming - giving the place a great atmosphere. My girlfriend and I stayed in the Executive Suite both times and absolutely loved the rooms. Food is great too. Will definitely be returning next time I‚Äôm in Belfast. ,5,2019,07,17
226,Fantastic Hotel,"The Fitzwilliam is in a great location easy access to the city centre, cinema and Grand Opera House the staff are extremely friendly and helpful in all areas of the hotel and the food is fabulous. The rooms are exceptionally clean with the beds very comfy. Highly Recommend ",5,2019,07,17
226,Lovely hotel,Lovely hotel and location. High quality 5 star accommodation. Would definitely recommend and stay again. Very easy walk from aircoach terminal with luggage and close to many good pubs. Very helpful and friendly staff ,5,2019,07,16
226,Top hotel with fantastic staff!,"We stayed at the Fitzwilliam Hotel for one hotel and found it to be worth everyone of its 5*, but more importantly had fantastic staff. We arrived very early and rather than having to leave our luggage were checked in early, our room 617. Luggage was brought up but the very friendly and professional concierge then explain all the room facilities, as you would expect from a 5* saw excellent, designed in in a contemporary staff, complimenting the equally stylish public area's. Now for the important bit where the staff and the hotel ethos showed its true colour and went beyond what was too be expected! At about 0330 I had a very seriously medical incident, 2 night staff responded immediately, one then stayed with my and my wife whilst the second greeted the ambulance. Both chaps were excellent and it sticks in my mind even in a stressful situation how reassuring and supportive they were. Even after the incident when I contacted the hotel from the hospital, Jarra (duty manager) and her team were again supportive beyond what was to be expected. Clearly this hotel is a 5* for a number of reasons but it's the personal side which is outstanding, all the staff were absolutely wonderful, caring, sincere and helped me get through a very difficult situation. I could not thank everyone at the Fitzwilliam enough and thoroughly recommend it.",5,2019,07,16
226,Lovely One Night Stay,"Very stylish, well appointed hotel.  The lobby is gorgeous.  Excellent location in city center.  Staff were very professional, helpful and welcoming.  Don't expect to be back in Belfast but highly recommend this hotel.",5,2019,07,14
226,Outstanding Service!,"Don't know where to begin to praise my recent stays at this hotel!  Check-in was swift, got into my room early and  promptly after a very long international flight.  The room was well-appointed and the bed heavenly.  While having a great lunch at the bar during my first stay, I was greeted by the impressive manager on duty (Yara) who called me by name and who stopped by to inquire if all was satisfactory.  My second time through, this time too I was offered a friendly greeting at the front desk and given an early and prompt check-in.  And amazingly during another great lunch, I was searched out again by Yara who stopped by to chat and to learn if there was anything I needed to make my stay more comfortable.  This incredible service and attention was in great contrast to my experience at the hotel next door where I went to visit a colleague who was staying there.  As a woman alone, I found it hard to get the attention of any of the gentlemen at the front desk.  My friend certainly did not rave about her stay there.",5,2019,07,13
226,Excellent hotel,Everything you want from a city break. The staff go above and beyond to ensure everything is perfect for you. Would highly recommend The Fitzwilliam to anyone staying in Belfast. Need to keep writing to get 200 characters,5,2019,07,13
226,Bring earplugs,Hotel is wonderful. The staff is amazing.  The only issue is noise.  I do not know if the walls are thin or what but we were kept awake or woken up to noise from the next room daily.  Housekeeping was particularly loud.,4,2019,07,13
226,Well Appointed Rooms and Nice Amenities,"Stayed here on business in April and had a great experience. The front desk staff were very nice and accommodating, helping us with restaurant recommendations, directions, taxis, etc.

The rooms were small but beautifully decorated and quite comfortable. For those of you looking for a comfortable mattress, I found this one to be firm but not rock hard. The walk-in showers were modern and stylish. Rooms had good WiFi service and are equipped with air conditioning, which is critical when staying in the city center in summer so you don‚Äôt have to breathe car fumes through open windows or for those who suffer allergies.

The breakfast service was a bit slow but the food was very tasty. All in all, if you can afford the cost, it is well worth the stay.",5,2019,07,13
226,50th birthday weekend ,"What an amazing hotel. We booked a junior deluxe suite and it didn't disappoint.  Floor to ceiling windows gave excellent views of the city. Huge comfy bed also with fab views.  Huge bathroom,  and all the facilities that you would ever need. Reception team really polite as were the doormen. Bar and restaurant were lovely and the selection of food and drinks were good.  Choices for breakfast were excellent and there was something for everyone. I had organised with Philip on the concierge to have a car take us on a political tour the city. I would recommend this as the driver was really knowledgeable and personable. Philip also recommended some great restaurants to eat at. All in all a great hotel situated in a central location.  ",5,2019,07,12
226,A Wonderful Experience,This was my second time staying in the hotel and it surpassed my high expectations. I had made the hotel aware this was a special anniversary for my wife and they really went the extra mile to welcome us. The staff are exceptionally friendly and hospitable without being over the top. The room was luxurious and comfortable (and very clean) and the added touch of the cafetiere was appreciated. We both enjoyed the food - at dinner and breakfast - it was of a very high quality and well presented. The bar was also great - we had intended to visit a few nearby bars but with it raining outside and the opulent surroundings it was a no-brainer to stay and try some of the classic cocktails on offer - we weren't disappointed.  A Five Star Stay in a Five Star Hotel *****,5,2019,07,12
226,Fabulous hotel,"Would highly recommend the Fitzwilliam hotel. Myself and my husband stayed on Saturday night for his birthday. The room was beautiful and the wee treat they left in room for birthday was a lovely touch. The meal in restaurant was gorgeous and the service was brilliant, will definitely stay again.",5,2019,07,11
226,Wonderful property with incredible service!,"Every top hotel should endeavor to deliver the type of service that is standard at the Fitzwilliam Hotel in Belfast. Each member of the staff from check-in to cleaning could host a ‚Äúmaster class‚Äù on service. We were met at the curb and did not have to touch our bags again until we were in our room. Check in was courteous, warm, and informative. The cleaning staff serviced the room at least twice each day, in the mornings and for a turn-down service at night. We have no reason to try any other hotel when visiting Belfast! We are actually returning to the Fitzwilliam for our final night before our return flight home.",5,2019,07,11
226,"Excellent hotel, first class staff","We were at the Fitzwilliam for three splendid nights. Room was decorated to an extremely high standard, much better than your average room, but this isn't your average hotel. Restaurant food was excellent and reasonably priced for such high quality. Front staff were very helpful and pleasant as were Les Clefs d'Or concierges. A charming young lady called Sarah-Louise regularly ensured that everything was to our satisfaction in the restaurant (had to name names here, Sarah-Louise epitomises the high standards of the Fitzwilliam and told us that she really likes working there).
We'll be back in Belfast in September, and we'll certainly be staying at the Fitzwilliam again.",5,2019,07,10
226,Disappointed this time,"We stayed for 2 nights from 7-9 July for my girlfriends birthday, usually everything is top notch but this time there was a massive vomit like stain on the bed! Alerted manager who did offer to move us to another room however we were happy enough with the bed being changed, amazed it wasn‚Äôt spotted before we seen it however everything else was good and the staff are very friendly ",4,2019,07,10
226,Amazing stay,"Stayed here for my partners birthday and they put so much effort into making it special, room was extremely spacious and very homely feel to it! Staff on arrival where very friendly and helpful, would definitely recommend anyone for a night away. ",5,2019,07,10
226,Fun in Greece has fun in Belfast,"What can Fun in Greece say about the Fitzwilliam Hotel in Belfast?  Not enough!  This is the most amazing hotel that fun in greece has stayed in this trip.  Advertised as 5 star, this hotel exceeds even that.  A uniformed concierge meets every guest on arrival and takes every effort to ensure that they wring the maximum fun out of Belfast (a surprisingly fun city).  No question is too stupid, no request too demanding.  The hotel and its team knock themselves out to ensure a great stay.  The hotel itself is beyond luxurious.  Fun in Greece wants every hotel to be like the Fitzwilliam.  And for the rating system to be raised to 7 stars just so the Fitz can be rated at 7!",5,2019,07,09
226,Luxurious Hotel,"We recently stayed at the Fitzwilliam Hotel Belfast for a family weekend away.  The staff were extremely helpful and friendly.  Nothing was too much.  The rooms were spacious, luxurious and spotless.

226,Great location!  Very nice hotel!,"This is a 5-Star hotel except for one aspect - our room was a corner suite which faced Great Victoria Street - which had traffic noises through the night!  All else was very good.  Staff are very friendly and full of knowledge.  The suite was spacious and full of amenities.  The location is well-located in the downtown area.  We would certainly stay there again, but this time in a room which does not face that busy street.",5,2019,07,08
226,"Beautiful hotel and room, great value and location!!","The hotel was beautiful from the lobby to the rooms and the bar.

226,5 star,"Outstanding service and food provided by the Fitzwilliam Hotel last week. Booked the breakfast plus dinner & cocktails break package, and we were not disappointed. Both of us required gluten feee food (due to allergies) and the lengths the staff went to in order to accommodate us were extraordinary. Dinner was outstanding, breakfast was outstanding and all the staff were outstanding. This is, without doubt, the best hotel I have ever stayed at. ",5,2019,07,07
226,Fantastic Long Weekend at the Fitzwilliam Belfast,"This is possibly one of the nicest hotels I have stayed in. We came to Belfast for a long birthday weekend and the staff at the Fitzwilliam really made our stay special. The hotel is well located, about 10-15 mins from City Airport and located near all the main sights to see. Our concierge Stephen went out of his way to ensure we got the most of the city and no request was any trouble at all. All the staff were friendly and courteous and really showed off that Irish charm! The food was excellent in the restaurant and the rooms were spacious , comfortable and felt premium. Would highly recommend a stay here on a visit to Belfast and would definitely stay again!",5,2019,07,06
226,5 Star Stay,"Staff were helpful and friendly, from advising attractions in the area and Hotel was amazing. Nothing too much for them.

226,Great Hotel,"The Fitzwilliam was a wonderful hotel. The rooms were spacious and luxurious.  The location is superb- Right around the corner from the Opera House.

226,"Belfast trip, the Fitzwilliam","The Fitzwilliam is a well located hotel in the middle of the center of the city.

Close to many pubs and restaurants. 

The city noise unfortunately makes it thru the windows of your room. Thus loud noises make it into the room. People singing in the street, alarms from stores (8 hour of noise), vehicles engines and horns are well heard.

The window frame is capable of receiving a second glass, highly recommended. 

The rooms are wonderful, as the restaurant and the room service.

I will recommend that the youngsters at the front desk receive better training specially in the treatment of guests. Our check out was not carried out at par with such beautiful hotel. Please train them. 

",4,2019,07,02
226,Great central hotel,"Excellent location and staff.
Breakfast is also excellent 
Lobby area is small but nice.
Our room was a bit noisy - from street and church bells.
Could do with triple glazing noise reduction.
Otherwise great ",5,2019,07,01
226,Enjoyable stay,"We were visiting Belfast to celebrate my husband's birthday and he was greeting by a cake when we entered our room.
The concierge and staff were extremely helpful, especially providing advice on where to dine and drink around the City.
All in all, it was a very pleasant stay.",5,2019,07,01
226,A nice hotel and friendly staff,"This hotel is in the heart of the city.  It's nice, clean and with a friendly staff.  The food in the restaurant is also excellent.   The reason this hotel didn't quite get a 5 start rating from us is because of the lighting and the beds in our room.  The d√©cor of the rooms is a bit funky.  There are lights that hang literally over your night stand and so low they hit you in the head if you move to reach for something on the night stand.  The lighting is terrible for any type of makeup application.  The mirror over the desk is the only place you have for blowing drying hair as there are no plugs in the bathroom, which is common in all of Ireland.   However, if the main plug is at the desk then the mirror should be much better than just an art piece.  It was very hard to do hair or makeup in the room.   The beds had sharp objects protruding out the side of the end of the bed, which seemed a bit unsafe as you could easily scrape your leg on it.  Other than these few things this hotel is very nice.  Friendly staff and comfortable nights sleep.",4,2019,06,30
226,Fabulous fitzwilliam in belfast,"Spent two days in this hotel and had a lovely time.  The concierge recommended a superb tour guide for us and gave us great recommendations for eating and touring

226,Top Hotel,"The service at this hotel must be the best we ever had. Right from the valet car parking to breakfast staff: only friendliness and service. Liam is a definate  asset  to this hotel.

226,A gem in the city,"The wife and i stayed here for three days and it was great,the first night it was the wife's Birthday and we dined and chilled out, the next was a family wedding  at the city hall and then to a different hotel, and they didn't come near to the standards of the Fitzs yes you pay a little extra but it's money well spent. The staff are all excellent and knowledgeable  all but I must mention Ciara who not only made us feel welcome to the hotel but also to Belfast  and suggested a number of places to visit.
Excellent time we will return soon.
Thanks to All",5,2019,06,27

226,Cocktails ,"Myself and 3 friends visited the bar of the Fitzwilliam on Saturday after seeing a show in the Opera House. Right next door!!! Absolutely beautiful decor in reception and the downstairs seating area with a smart doorman there to welcome us.

The general manager on shift, Lauren showed us to a booth in the funky bar downstairs. She was just lovely and made us feel special and valued as customers!! We werebrought a drinks menu instantly by a fab waitress, Beth!! There was a lot of indecision so Beth helped us along and the girls finally decided on their chosen cocktail! Beth was very patient with us and her knowledge was super! Being pregnant,I wasn't sure what to get but in the end had a notion for a sparking appletiser!! I felt just as special with my chosen drink when it arrived with sliced crispy apple fanned inside the glass!! Just as fab looking as the cocktails!! Hats off to the bar staff!! Lauren checked in on us again to see if we were enjoying our cocktails. What a lovely lady!! She clearly enjoys her job and is proud of the Fitzwilliam!!

After the (great) gig, we headed back to the hotel bar and were welcomed by Brian, who, quite frankly, was brilliant. We ordered Guinness and a Hot Toddy! Jacob, the barman, was friendly, knowledgeable and funny. He was a good lad. A shout out for Beth, who served us some snacks earlier in the day. If you‚Äôre off to Belfast, this hotel is ace!!!

226,GOT Honeymoon,"We planned a honeymoon trip to Ireland focused on Game of Thrones since we are huge fans of the show.  We stayed in Dublin 2 nights and then traveled to Belfast where we stayed at The Fitzwilliam for 4 nights.  I was originally trying to book at Jury's Inn because that is where the Game of Thrones tours departed from however the dates weren't available.  So, after looking at the map, The Fitzwilliam was right next door so I booked this hotel.  From the time of arrival my husband and I both were thankful that the Jury's Inn was booked and we ended up here.  The staff (shout out to Nathan) were all very attentive and helpful.  We loved the look, feel and atmosphere of this hotel.  We ate in the bar and in the restaurant during out stay and both were accommodating and food was delicious.  I have stayed in other 5 star hotels before and this tops them all!!  And, for other GOT fans, some of the main actors/actresses stayed at this hotel while filming :-)",5,2019,06,23
226,Fantastic hotel and service,"Staff amazing. Accommodation very comfortable, clean and all the amenities you could need.
We were only staying for 2 nights, so wanted to pack in as much as possible.
The staff were extremely knowledgeable about the area and were a great help in offering areas to visit and restaurants to eat at. They also booked tours and trips on our behalf, which helped immensely. Philip in particular, was a star.
We will definitely be revisiting soon. Thanks Fitzwilliam üòÑ",5,2019,06,23

The gym was a little disappointing; needing to wind down after long days work it‚Äôs very small and basic and short of much range, nonetheless, wouldn‚Äôt put me off a return at all. ",4,2019,06,18

From the moment we walked in the door.  Our night was fantastic and completely faultless. The food and service at this hotel is perfect. 

Ruairi greeted us as we entered the restaurant and made us feel comfortable immediately.

226,Great hotel,"We have just stayed for 4 nights on a bed and breakfast basis. Our room was lovely (803) and recently refurbished. Our only slight annoyance was being opposite the lift, and not all guests were considerate at keeping the noise down when returning after a late evening. The staff were all really smartly uniformed, knowledgeable and helpful. We had thought the cost of overnight car parking was a little steep, but it was so good to be able to hand over the keys as we arrived, as the Belfast roads are very busy and confusing with one way streets, so we didn‚Äôt mind the cost after all.  We also appreciated the little extra attention to detail things, e.g. bottled water waiting in the car when it was bought to the door.  The hotel restaurant offered good choices for breakfast and dinner with pleasant and attentive service. 
All the staff we interacted with were of Northern Irish nationality, and very proud to share their country and heritage, which we found welcoming and delightful.  We are very happy to recommend this hotel.",5,2019,06,15

Hotel is centrally located and within walking distance of various pubs. Staff is helpful with arranging day trips. Morning food is more than perfect. Titanic museum is definitely worth a visit. Districts Fallsroad and Shankill visited by taxi. Taxi transport is excellent.

For city centre location - you can‚Äôt beat it

For service - you can‚Äôt beat it. The staff are all amazing, from the minute you arrive at the door you‚Äôre welcomed, escorted to reception, bags taken - what more could you want. 

The rooms are fantastically decorated, quiet and comfortable. 

And breakfast - amazing. The buffet has everything you can imagine. And the hot food menu choice makes it a difficult decision as to what to have. 

Thanks again guys. Loved the stay",5,2019,06,09
226,All the way from NM,"Location, staff and dinner was outstanding.  Parking is a little of a challenge in downtown Belfast, but staff was helpful.  Good value for Belfast and professional service.  Avoca was our favorite shopping place with a great deli.",5,2019,06,09

The rooms are very nice and parking was a huge plus as we had driven to Belfast and weren't sure where we could have parked so close to the city centre.,5,2019,06,05

226,Amazing hotel!,"This hotel is amazing! Rooms are gorgeous, interior decor is üòç. Friendly and helpful staff at reception and throughout the hotel. Only negative is we had dinner in the restaurant and the portion sizes were quite small. Other than that great hotel located in the heart of Belfast üòä",5,2019,06,04
226,Centrally located hotel with fabulous customer service,"Really mixed views this time around.  I've booked the studio suite before - which is no longer available and caters for bigger parties.  And expected this suite to be of the similar calibre as such. 

I booked the Fitz for a weekend break.  Initially booking a city view, I then upgraded to a suite and feel that the upgrade cost was not worth it, as whilst the room was slightly bigger the view was nothing to scream about.  
My sister had a smaller room and she was on the 9th floor... and the view was awesome. 
Now to be fair, the staff and all the team worked hard to make sure all of our party had a comfortable stay and a great time - hence the 4 starts. 
 And the hotel is central to most things, I think. The opera house is next door, st George‚Äôs market is 15 mins walk away, you‚Äôve some nice restaurants on your doorstep and approx 20 min walk to cathedral quarter for more bars and restaurants. And if you don‚Äôt want to walk that far, Brennan‚Äôs across the road is fine for a cold pint or four. 
But for me, it's 4 out of 5 this time.",4,2019,06,04
226,Lovely Hotel,"The hotel is very beautiful and very centrally located, within walking distance of all attractions. The bed was extremely comfortable. I loved the decor of the room. The staff were very helpful and friendly.
",4,2019,06,04
226,Exceptional customer service,"This is a lovely hotel - you can tell from photos online that it's a physically beautiful place to stay, and I was very pleased with my room and the overall vibe of the hotel. It's also a great value, and the location can't be beat. 

But I want to mention the absolutely next-level customer service I experienced. I came to N.I. in large part to visit Giant's Causeway, and managed to accidentally miss the tour I had booked thanks to an alarm mishap (my fault). I was devastated, but the concierges calmly and efficiently managed to find a similar day trip with a different company that left a little bit later, and completely saved the day. Then, in my haste to pack up and check out that morning (I had to head back to Dublin that night), I left some important things in the room. When I got back to Belfast after the wonderful day trip, I realized what I was missing and the front desk employees went out of their way to contact the cleaning team to try to track it down despite the lost & found being locked for the night.

I know that hotels always do what they can to make sure their customers are happy, but the concierges and front desk team at the Fitzwilliam went so above and beyond that I have to shout their praises from the rooftops. If you find yourself in Belfast, you can't ask for a better place to stay. Thank you again!!",5,2019,06,03

226,Enjoyable Stay in Belfast,"We had a great time staying at the Fitzwilliams Hotel in Belfast. Getting the car parked was a bit tricky but worked out fine in the End, as we could park at a nearby Parking House. Mayne this coukd be noted more prominent in the booking confirmation or website. Reception was friendly, the room clean and nicely designed. We had an awesome view out over the roofs of the city. The staff where friendly, house keeping top and also the breakfast was very enjoyable.",5,2019,06,02
226,"A lovely hotel, but fails to deliver on offers","Stayed here on the fitz and thrones deal, where it advertised a nights b&b with a Dragonglass cocktail and tickets to the game of thrones exhibit. The hotel itself was lovely, room and breakfast fine. When checking in, there was no mention of how we claimed the free cocktail and when asked I was given a voucher for one cocktail, even though there were 2 people staying. I queried this but was told that was all we were entitled to. A phone call from reception later said there were 2 cocktails available and it was their mistake and to just ask at the bar. Fine, except when our group went to the bar and asked for the cocktails, such a faff was made about it, asking for room numbers and checking with reception. We felt as if we were criminals asking for something that we were entitled to and had paid for! We didn‚Äôt let it spoil our night and had a great time in the city but when checking out found that they had charged us for the cocktails after all! Not impressed and btw, there was no dragonglass cocktail as promised, just a pick from the classic cocktail menu. After more faffing about the bill, it was eventually sorted. I‚Äôve stayed here before and loved it but this will definitely make me think twice before booking again unfortunately.",4,2019,06,02

226,Group dinner at the Fitzwilliam May 2019,"I was part of a small group who organised a dinner for 38 people at the Fitzwilliam Hotel in May 2019.  From the outset the staff were absolutely excellent. First of all I liaised with Natalia in the Sales Team, who was both pleasant and professional - a complete joy to work with!  The pre dinner organising went very smoothly all thanks to Natalia!  On the night Patrick the restaurant manager was constantly on hand.  When I suggested rearranging the table layout he immediately obliged, although we eventually went with the original layout nothing whatsoever was a problem!  All the restaurant staff I met have the maturity and training to be able to speak to guests and behave in a friendly and professional manner. The food was delicious, enjoyed by all!  Based on this experience i would not hesitate to recommend the Fitzwilliam as a venue for dinner.",5,2019,06,02

226,Lovely hotel in an excellent position,"This trip was booked for our 33 wedding anniversary and we wanted somewhere close to the heart of Belfast, but which could also be a good base to travel around Northern Ireland. The stay was wonderful, a lovely clean and friendly hotel with all if the staff extremely helpful. Food was great and reasonably priced. The only downfalls were the room was very warm, even without the heating on and a little noisy when the window was opened. Although the parking was subsidised it was a little awkward as it was over 200yrds away with a one way road system. Overall an excellent hotel which we would highly recommend. ",5,2019,05,28
226,Disappointing,"Greeted by a very rude concierge, smell from the bathroom, light in the hall not working and the breakfast room and bar were not in keeping with a 5 star hotel.  The saving grace was the duty manager who was a true professional. ",1,2019,05,28

226,Very comfortable hotel in a great location,"We stayed here during a 4 night trip to Belfast. 

The location of the hotel is excellent, very close to most restaurants in the city centre, across the road from the bus station, right next to the Game of Thrones tour pick-up point and it was possible to walk to the Titanic docks in around 30 minutes. 

Our room was very comfortable and the perfect place to relax after a busy day of tours or sightseeing. I really appreciated all the little details, a candle and matches for the bath, good quality tea bags, the chocolates provided with the turn down service and the bathrobe and slippers. The shower was very powerful and the bed very comfortable. Despite our room being next to the lift, we had no issues with noise at all.

We had dinner in the bar one evening, and the food, drinks and service were excellent. Alot of thought was put into the presentation of the drinks.

The only minor issue was the temperature control of the room. It seemed to be hard to get it right, it either got progressively colder or too hot. 

We really enjoyed our stay here and hope to return to this hotel again on our next visit to Belfast.",5,2019,05,18
226,"Excellent location, friendly staff","We stayed four nights in this comfortable hotel. Its location in Central Belfast is superb. Our room was compact but comfortable and attractively furnished. There was some noise from the traffic. The staff were friendly, helpful and polite. The hotel serves a good Continental breakfast buffet. English breakfast dishes may be ordered at no extra charge. We were also satisfied with the restaurants. A residents‚Äô four course dinner is offered at GBP 25. We would like to return to this hotel in the future.",5,2019,05,18
226,Pre Theatre Dinner - Gluten Free!,"We prebooked our meal and informed them one guest who was gluten free, to which the receptionist replied thank you the chef likes to know when we have GF guests.
However on our visit it was clear that neither staff nor chef gave a stuff about their gluten free guest!!!
The menu was a tad confusing when it came to what was, what wasn't although later we were informed this intolerance matrix is used worldwide! My friends and I have travelled the world and ate in some very fine restaurants and have never saw this matrix!!!
However the young server pointed out that because our friend was GF parts of the plate would be excluded which of course makes it GF (less food), when the dish arrived these components were on the plate!!!! What happened did the chef have no awareness!
Dessert again a tad confusing, young waiter assured us the dish came in a GF option, so when both desserts came out it was asked which one is GF, young waitress took them away and a manageress was brought to the table!
So if you have an intolerance or worse an allergy please make an extra loud case as they may well just ignore you!
Apart from this the good was excellent.
On a finishing note if you have a problem and are told we will reflect it on the bill, don't expect anything because that's what we got, nothing...",3,2019,05,18
226,Olly Murs Concert,"My sister and I stayed at The Fitzwilliam Hotel on 14/05/2019. Had an amazing time, hotel was easily found, all staff exceptionally polite and friendly. We had tea in the bar which was delicious,wine even more so lol. We walked to and back from the concert (20 mins). 

Room was beautiful, clean and turn down service with chocolates on your pillow was a lovely touch. Would definitely return to this hotel.",5,2019,05,17
226,First rate,"Just one night ,easy to find and a great location.
Very warm welcome ,friendly door staff and so helpful .
Corner bedroom was very comfortable ,lovely bathroom ,great decor ,just a shame the curtain didn‚Äôt go all the way to the floor to keep out that last bit of annoying light.
Spot on breakfast with a wide choice.

A very good 5 star hotel .",5,2019,05,15
226,Excellent location and comfort,Close to railway station and bus services. Convenient to all major attractions. Hotel fully measured up to its 5 Star rating. Staff friendly and attentive to all needs. Lovely relaxed atmosphere. Would like to stay there again.,5,2019,05,15
226,Lovely hotel ,"Had one night and like others reviews wish it had been longer.   Everything was perfect even candles in the bathroom which was a nice touch.      Beds are comfy and the room has everything you could need in a hotel.   Staff were friendly, check in was easy.   A great hotel ",5,2019,05,15
226,Everything was perfect,"My husband and I stayed for a long weekend in Belfast and would highly recommend this beautiful hotel. The staff couldn‚Äôt have been more attentive and the breakfast was delicious with a wide range to choose from.
We enjoyed cocktails in the bar and lovely live music on the Saturday evening.",5,2019,05,14
226,Friendly Fitzwilliam,"We had an excellent couple of nights at this hotel - the staff were fantastic in particular. Friendly and efficient service at all times, and the rooms were comfortable and very well maintained. Would heartily recommend to anyone!",5,2019,05,13
226,Great Bar Service,"Had a lovely time at the bar a few days ago, lovely staff - one named Jacob was very professional and willing to help and be patient while I decided on my drink! Definitely recommend and will be back again.",5,2019,05,12
226,Excellent Honeymoon Stay,"We stayed at The Fitzwillaim when we visited Belfast for our honeymoon. The hotel was excellent, as were the staff. Lovely touch to leave a congratulations card and cake in our room upon arrival. Would definitely stay here again. ",5,2019,05,11
226,Highly recommended,"We stayed for 3 nights in midweek. Can't fault a thing about the room or the staff. The room was sumptuous, the staff couldn't do enough to help you. The location was also excellent, being well located in the city centre. We didn't try the food though so can't comment on that, other than to say we witnessed someone being served with a cream tea in the lobby and that looked the business. The only thing I would say is that the drinks and mixers were more expensive than the bars over the road that we'd just been in.",5,2019,05,11
226,Not quite a 5 star,"The hotel was lovely, staff friendly and location was good but I would not see the hotel as 5 star. I think a 4 star would be a more realistic hotel rating. The food in the bar was poor but the food in the restaurant was of a much higher standard and quality. ",3,2019,05,10
226,Wonderful hotel and staff,"Everything about the hotel was perfect, we loved our very clean room, the decor was just to our taste.  Lovely hot baths and fantastic showers. You could have a lie in because the curtains did not let in any light and we did not hear any road noise. The staff were polite and helpful. Thank you.",5,2019,05,09
226,Elegance and classic,"Beautiful room, really comfortable bed,  great breakfast buffet as well as special order (the eggs benedict were wonderful), great location. The shower was memorable.   It was everything one would want in a hotel",5,2019,05,09
226,5* Hotel with 6* Service and 4* Price,"We arrived on Monday afternoon at the Hotel and decided to park the car directly outside the Hotel to unload our luggage for check-in. We were immediately approached by the Porter of the Hotel offering to bring our luggage in and park our car, which was very help full.
The check-in was quick and uncomplicated, with a perfect smile. The room was very nice and gave us a warm cosy feeling. The bed was fabulous, with a perfect mattress and a selection of cushions. Not only a nice and clean room, but also the bathroom a perfect addition to the experience.  
The breakfast was partly buffet and selection from the menue. The Eggs Benedict done to perfection. I would have wished that the seating at the Breakfast would been a bit more comfortable and spacey. We felt the seating arrangement was a let down of our so far good experience.
All the service was quick and on the spot. The staffs helpfulness was only outdone by their friendliness.",5,2019,05,08
226,Very nice hotel,"Beautiful room, wonderful location within walking distance of many restaurants and shops. Easy walk from train station. Service was lovely, especially turndown housekeepers were knowledgable about workings of room (switch for heated towel bar, electrical outlet issues.) Clean and spacious room with comfortable bed and large and lovely bath. Breakfast was good but a bit uneven in replenishment of buffet.",5,2019,05,08
226,Amazing Bartender!,"Had a great bartender when I visited the bar of hotel. Jacob was thoughtful and very nice and professional. Everything made to perfection and offered to fix anything if drink or food was not satisfactory. Very helpful with drink suggestions. As well being professional he was very easy to talk to and funny which made me feel comfortable and ease during my visit there. Highly recommend, 10/10 service, hope to be served by him again soon.",5,2019,05,08
226,Amazing!,"Beautiful upscale hotel in the centre of Belfast. I was attending a conference and initially booked to stay in the same hotel the conference was held but fortunately for me, that place was awful and the staff very unprofessional so I ended up moving to the Fitzwliam Hotel and what a pleasure that was! I could not recommend this hotel highly enough.",5,2019,05,07
226,Post Wedding stay,After a wedding at the Carriage Rooms many of the party including the bride and groom stayed at the Fitzwilliam. Our experience was fantastic. The hotel could not have looked after us any better. We all had a wonderful stay and would not hesitate to recommend this to any one in a similar position.,5,2019,05,07
226,One of the best hotels we've stayed in,"We decided on a whim to head up to Belfast for the bank holiday weekend and the Fitzwilliam had a great spring deal which meant we could get an executive room for the normal base room price.

The hotel definitely has a wow factor when you walk into the lobby with a nice fire and pastel colours. Then up in the room we were impressed by the large bed, the comfortable couch, the desk (with lots of plug sockets) and the black-out curtains. The rooms and bathrooms are very clean.

The shower is really nice. The executive rooms also offer baths. 

We slept really well, probably the best I remember sleeping in a hotel in a long time. The only thing is there is a church nearby that rings its bells at 9am and I was woken up Sunday and Monday mornings by them, despite wearing earplugs. 

The only other little complaint I would have is the hairdryer isn't great. You have to hold the button down to turn it on and the power is quite weak.

But otherwise we had a fantastic stay. We appreciated the little touches like the chocolates, the nice selection of teas, the pack of cards and the mints. We also found that the room service were very helpful. They brought us up another pillow and a selection of cheese despite not being on the official menu.

We also ordered cocktails from the bar and the servers were really lovely.

In terms of location, you couldn't do better. You're right between the Cathedral Quarter and the Botanic Quarter. We were surrounded by great bars and restaurants. We tried Edo and James St, both fantastic and both around the corner from the hotel. The hotel was also only a 15-minute walk from the train station.",5,2019,05,07
226,"Lovely stay, enjoyable luxury during business travel","This location is wonderfully set in downtown area, close to restaurants and shops so that walking is a breeze. I love the fact that there is a partnership with a local gym, making fitness and wellness easy to work into a long work day.",5,2019,05,06
226,"Beautiful hotel, really good service","The rooms are beautiful and really clean. Everyone is kind and willing to help you with whatever you need. 
The location is great, you can walk to nice restaurants & shops. 
The only thing that could be done better is: not throwing away the soap after one day of use (in the room). ",5,2019,05,06
226,Fabulous hotel amazing visit,Fabulous hotel amazing stay service brilliant. Staff so friendly and polite. Food was also beautiful and highly enjoyed the cocktails and the staff recommend once a to Try and were great and the band were brilliant too. ,5,2019,05,06
226,Restaurant review only,"I had to check what was vegetarian on the menu as it was unclear. Our server was helpful and confirmed what I could order as a vegetarian. From the pre-theatre menu only soup for starter and on mains, the Gnocchi.
The rest of our party had mixtures of the beef and tuna starters which they thoroughly enjoyed, and equally enjoyed their steak and chicken dishes.
My gnocchi came out covered in shaved Parmesan. I suspected so, checked with a server who was apologetic and took away my plate. I had a fresh meal served that did not contain any animal product quite quickly but as my party were finishing their meal. 
I was disappointed that a 5 star luxury hotel could make such a mistake and because of this I cannot return or recommend, even when the staff are professional and quite delightful and the rest of my party had a satisfactory meal. ",3,2019,05,05
226,Outstanding hotel,Absolutely love the fitzwilliam hotel.. can be quite expensive but worth every penny. You get what you pay for. Service and food is amazing. Rooms are outstanding comfort at its best would definately recommend ,5,2019,05,04
226,Fantastic luxury hotel in the heart of Belfast.,"Stayed for one night. Excellent hotel with great quirks both in room and dotted around the hotel.

My minor criticism was the limited parking, however they do have a deal with the car park in close proximity, validate your ticket and the staff at the car park will reduce your charges. Another small point was the minibar not being stocked up. There is a Tesco express across the road so I got room snacks from there instead...

The bar was very cosey and you had the choice of sitting in a booth where you are able to enjoy privacy or on a table that is more ""public""

Staff are very friendly and have excellent customer care skills.

Very happy with my stay and would definitely stay again.",5,2019,05,04
226,Celebrations,"60th birthday üéÇ celebration for my partner. Room brilliant and acknowledgement of birthday let in form of little cake. Fantastic time and so central.
Staff amazing and nothing a problem. Cocktails delicious. ",5,2019,05,03
226,Not worthy of 5 stars,"To be honest, I‚Äôm not one to leave bad reviews but I think this is an exception considering how disappointed I was. I heard so much good about this hotel, so spent a lot of money for a nice room, and I was not pleased. When I walked into the room the first thing I noticed was the dirt on the cupboards. Then as we walked on in, the room was no where near as big as it appeared in the photos, and then I looked out the window and seen our view.. a big brown building, slap bang right out the window.. safe to say we kept out curtains closed most of the stay. The noise from outside was insane too, walls must be very thin cause our neighbors could be heard easily! We decided we‚Äôd have my partners birthday meal in the bar, and there was a nice hair in his mashed potato which of coarse instantly put him off. Lastly, me and my partner had just returned from the city and were relaxing in our room before getting ready to head off for a meal, our door knocked and before my boyfriend even had time to get his jeans on properly the lady knocking on the door to give us chocolates had already let herself into our room!  
I don‚Äôt know maybe I‚Äôm being harsh because I had such high expectations but I don‚Äôt know how this hotel got 5 stars, I‚Äôve spent way less on hotels in the same area ( the maldron, the Clayton) and they‚Äôve been much better! Would not recommend, sorry guys.",2,2019,05,02
226,A cut above the rest,"I stay in a lot of hotels, and frankly they pretty much all make a good effort nowadays (with some occaional sad exceptions). Therefore it was really refreshing to find in the Fitzwilliam a hotel which genuinely excelled, raising the bar that little bit above the big chains and providing a truly enjoyable experience. The breakfast (wide-ranging buffet and cooked-to-order menu) was particularly outstanding!",5,2019,05,02
226,One night in the Fitz!,"Room was not clean on arrival with dirty handprint on glass mirrors but on second attempt we where upgraded to a suitable room.. 
The breakfast was really lovely and good selection, good location, close to bus station.. ",3,2019,05,01
226,Five star in the centre of town,"Lovely hotel, right in the heart of town, close to the bus depot for the airport shuttle.Abundant choice for breakfast, and guests specail in the evening in the restaurant was smashing!
The staff were lovely, smiling, helpful- they are a credit to the hotel.
Plenty bars nearby, with music, restaurants and the tourist office across the street.
The concierge can rustle up a taxi in  moment, and keep your luggage afetr checkout.
We came in very early, in a strom, and found our room ready so we could dry out and change- fab!
Thank you for making our short great such great fun!",5,2019,05,01
226,Amazing stay.,Everything was perfect and every member of staff we came in contact with were very helpful and friendly. The hotel is in a fantastic position as well. There was nothing negative to say about our entire stay there.,5,2019,04,30
226,Nice room but not very relaxed,"The room was nice but the staff were a bit full on. 
We checked in and left for 30 minutes for food and returned to find hotel staff had been in the room and moved our things that we had only just put out. 
We tried to return to our room with friends before heading out but door staff wouldn't let our friends up to the room insisting that it was residents only. 
They need to lighten up a bit.",3,2019,04,29
226,Wonderful hotel,We enjoyed a wonderful stay at this hotel in April 2019. The lobby and rooms are beautiful and the breakfast was great. The staff were very accommodating and the hotel is in a central location within walking distance of all of Belfast's attractions. We would not hesitate to return to the Fitzwilliam hotel.,5,2019,04,29
226,Belfast stay at Fitzwilliam,"Wonderful hotel! Terrific location. Great amenities. Couldn't have had a better experience and would recommend it wholeheartedly. Elegant interiors, friendly staff, very nice food. Everyone worked over and above expectations. ",5,2019,04,29
226,Central belfast Hotel,Absolutely first class hotel in the centre of Belfast. Both the staff and service are absolutely first class. Arguably the best hotel in Belfast and I always look forward to visiting the fantastic city.,5,2019,04,29
226,Fantastic hotel with amazing staff,"We stayed at the Fitzwilliam to celebrate our wedding anniversary. Neither of us had been to Belfast before and we could not have stayed in a more gorgeous location. From the moment we arrived we received nothing but exceptional service. The room was gorgeous and our concierge Liam provided great recommendations on what to do and where to eat during our stay. The food in the hotel is great (we had breakfast and dinner) and we also had cocktails (the Cosmopolitan was the best I have ever had!). It is really had to describe how much we enjoyed our stay but it was very special. We would especially like to thank Liam, Nathan, Anna, Simon and Shannon for making our stay perfect. We can't wait to come and stay again. If you are looking for a luxurious hotel in Belfast then I would choose the Fitzwilliam every time.",5,2019,04,28
226,World Class,"A truly marvellous stay from the moment you arrive from the front of house staff to the spotless rooms and amazing breakfast choices, exceptional service from all bar and restaurant staff.  With one member of bar team even offering to show us around her home town of Downpatrick on her day off! way beyond the call of duty.  Felt truly papered with the bed turndown service and the cholates a lovely touch, will see you again soon.  ",5,2019,04,28
226,Fab friendly hotel with delicious food,"My brief stay has reminded me why we used to stay in the Fitzwilliam Belfast. the friendliness of the staff is exceptional, while the food is delicious, in particular the breakfast which if anything has improved. I will be back",5,2019,04,26
226,Combined business and leisure trip,"Very comfortable hotel.  Excellent service.  Very high standard accomodation and good location.  Enjoyed the experience.  Would definately stay again.  Was not over impressed with quality of breakfast.  There was arange of dishes on offer from  chosen menu but the standard full breakfast was poor quality 1 slice of bacon, this was well done like it had been kept hot till service and one  sausage.  You  could select eggs and how they were cooked. We felt the standard was below expectation for a 5 star hotel.  This was the only fault we found during our stay. ",5,2019,04,26
226,what a wonderful place to stay,"Have only positive things to say about the hotel. The room, facilities, food and staff were all fantastic
This was my first visit to Belfast and, mainly from my experience at the Fitzwilliam, have already committed myself to returning as soon as possible",5,2019,04,25
226,Unbelievable,This is my second visit to this hotel! I can not fault it the rooms are lovely the service is even better! Room service is amazing 12.30am and food delivered exactly what we wanted with a smile. Can‚Äôt fault the friendlessness of staff from morning to night. 100% will be back!,5,2019,04,24
226,Great Weekend in Belfast,"I had a wonderful weekend in Belfast recently, which included a 3-night stay at the Fitzwilliam. Our room was very nice, with a lovely view of the city - everything was clean and comfortable. There was plenty of space to stretch out and relax, the bathtub was amazing at the end of a long day, and the towel warmer was much appreciated. The breakfast downstairs was quite good with a nice variety, and we were always satisfied. I would return.",5,2019,04,24
226,Only ok for 5 star hotel,"Double charged for room even before I arrived. 6 days later still waiting for my money back. 
Food quality was ok but not up to 5 star standard in my option and restaurant could do with an over Hall for a 5 star hotel. ",3,2019,04,24
226,Wonderful Trip,Fantastic hotel with friendly helpful staff.  Room was spotlessly clean and luxurious. Easy walking distance to shops and restaurants. We had pre booked the Valet parking which was really helpful and the concierge was pleasant and very efficient.  Will definitely be returning.,5,2019,04,24
226,Weekend to visit Niece,Fantastic hotel lives up to its 5* rating. From arrival we were well looked after bags taken to room when room was ready. Breakfast was excellent Millard sausages were very tasty. Our room 806 had views to die for and a very comfy bed. Wonderful experience ,5,2019,04,24
226,Beautiful Hotel,"Beautiful Hotel, wonderful staff, great location. They make an amazing Espresso Martini!! It was our first visit to Belfast and can't wait for our return visit. The hotel is very well located for sightseeing and shopping ",5,2019,04,23
226,Luxurious,Great place to stay. Very modern and comfortable. Good enough for many Game of Thrones cast members! I especially liked the bathroom. Candles around the large soaking tub were a nice touch. Great location. Plenty of nearby restaurants. I would definitely stay here again!,5,2019,04,22
226,Easter visit,We visited this fabulous hotel for cocktails over Easter weekend. The service was impeccable and of a very high standard and we were made to feel very welcome even though we weren't staying there. The cocktails were amazing and on Friday there was a 2 for 1 offer which was a nice surprise! We will definitely be back in the not too distant future when we return to this amazing city and hopefully stay next time so we can experience more of the amazing service we received! The hotel should be very proud of it's friendly and professional staff who all made an impression on us.Thank you for helping to make our first visit to Belfast a memorable one!!,5,2019,04,22
226,Kerrie & Tom,"Fabulous hotel! Staff are very friendly, welcoming and extremely helpful! Declan and Gerard from concierge were especially helpful and helped to make our stay more enjoyable! To be honest all of the staff were amazing! The room was fabulous and the bed was so comfortable! They had everything you can think of such as hairdryer, playing cards, chocolates, mints, candle in the bathroom etc the bath and shower were lovely. Very clean! We loved our stay here and will certainly be coming back again! You will not be disappointed if you book here!!",5,2019,04,21

226,Truly inviting and luxurious hotel,"This hotel stay was given as a gift for myself and my husband we have stayed in Belfast loads of times but never in The Fitzwilliam but we will definitely be staying again. It is extremely friendly, luxurious and in an ideal part of Belfast, would highly recommend it. ",5,2019,04,19
226,Exceptional Hotel,"The staff, were exceptional always greeting me by my surname. I arrived early they received my luggage, and placed it up in my room while I was away from the hotel. The hotel bar was wonderful the bar tenders very knowledgeable, and the guest company were all very friendly and welcoming. ",5,2019,04,17
226,Nice hotel,Stayed for 3 nights and all the staff were very friendly and helpful.location is perfect smack in the centre of Bel food in the hotel is exalent and not overpriced for the quality.Parking is expensive at ¬£20 per night.,4,2019,04,17
226,Great stay,"Would highly reccomend this hotel, clean, modern and luxurious. Great location in Belfast, close to bars, restaurants and next to the Grand Opera House. Very helpful staff, definitely worth the money.

",5,2019,04,16
226,Just Wonderful,"So many pleasantries at the Fitz. From the front desk, to the restaurant, and all around, this hotel is a class act and I couldn't be happier with the service and friendliness of this place. Comfortable and well-designed rooms, great toiletries, and wonderful breakfast. ",5,2019,04,16
226,Fantastic,We stayed in Saturday night and hotel was amazing. We had an awards ceremony elsewhere but couldn‚Äôt fault this hotel. Breakfast was beautiful. Room service amazing. I would highly recommend staying here. ,5,2019,04,16
226,Good nights craic,"Lovely ambience, staff very attentive friendly and polite. Had a great nights sleep bed very comfortable. Cooked Breakfast was good although had a bit of a wait for it. Music in bar was very good had us up dancing!",4,2019,04,16
226,A special hotel for a special occasion,"We booked this hotel for a special occasion and were not disappointed. This is a lovely hotel in the heart of a busy city. It is extremely friend, clean and comfortable. There is a vast choice of foods at breakfast that would leave no one disappointed.  There is noise from the street but the ear plugs provided are a great help.  The staff were attentive at all times and give great recommendations for our stay. ",5,2019,04,15
226,Lovely hotel very centrally located,"I stayed here a few months ago on business as the price on the night was reasonable. It is often much higher. The staff were extremely friendly and the room was very luxurious. The decor is all very dark but still sumptuous. The breakfast was great as was the sleep quality, wifi speed and service. I would stay again if the price was right.",5,2019,04,15
226,Great hotel in a great city,"We have just returned from a 2 night 3 day trip to Belfast.  We stayed in room 519 a Superior King in a weekend deal they had on their own website.  What a lovely room, really top notch.  All the staff we encountered were excellent, friendly and very informative.  I genuinely think they would have done anything we asked.  Took advantage of the car parking at the hotel as to make sure our hire car was available whenever we needed it.  Every time we had requested it, there were two bottles of water inside which was a nice touch.

The bar was excellent, great selection of draft beers and spirits.  On the Saturday night there was a local singer on, didn‚Äôt get his name but he was very good and really got people singing along.  Fantastic range of songs, old and new.  No Dolly Parton though.....üòâüòâüòâüòâ so of course, could be improvedüòÄ

We didn‚Äôt use the restaurant at all so don‚Äôt know what it was like, sure it would have been great.

The room it‚Äôs self was very nice and had a lovely selection of bits and bobs needed whilst away.  Maybe a few more coffee and milks would be useful but that is fairly trivial.

Belfast it‚Äôs self is an amazing city and I will definitely stay at the Fitzwilliam next time.",5,2019,04,14
226,Lovely luxury stay in Belfast,"A lovely touch of luxury on our overnight stay in Belfast. Friendly and efficient staff. Well-appointed rooms and a stone's throw from City Hall, Opera House and The Crown. Fab breakfast with plenty of choice. If you're a light sleeper you may find yourself woken up by the traffic outside, although that may be more to do with our rooms being second floor. Would def stay again but ask for room higher up.",4,2019,04,14
226,Back injury and terrible noise - worst ever stay in a hotel,"Do NOT book the Standard Accessible room unless you are a wheelchair user without an able-bodied travelling companion or otherwise require one very low (& very small) sink. The room is described as ‚Äòwheelchair accessible‚Äô. It is not described as specifically adapted, which it is. There is no standard sink in the bathroom. And note that there is nowhere in the wet room style shower to put your soap and shampoo except on the floor (so neither standard nor accessible). 
I injured my back using the very low sink on the first morning and it ruined my visit, led to me abandoning a subsequent trip to Lyon and I am still in pain over 2 weeks later. The response from reception was disgraceful. On informing them of the injury and that I had been put in an inappropriate room I politely asked to move room. I was unsympathetically told that I would have to pay extra for the ‚Äòupgrade‚Äô. This was later reimbursed by the Duty Manager following my suggesting this was a wholly inappropriate response. She expressed great concern, but no manager ever enquired about my wellbeing again over the 4 days. In fact the large broken mirror on the door of the room next to us was very noisily removed one morning and no-one thought to inform us. It sounded like someone was breaking in to our room. 
The concierges were good (thanks Liam for your concern and advice re back pain) unlike reception. As we left early on the final morning and no concierge was available I struggled with my cases to leave for the taxi. The 2 men on reception just watched my struggling and suffering. In retrospect I should have requested their help but would have thought in a supposedly ‚Äò5 Star‚Äô establishment this would be offered.  
I have stayed in many hotels and have never complained. My worst experience of a hotel ever. ",1,2019,04,13
226,Great 1st stop in N. Ireland,"The Fitzwilliam Hotel matched the great reviews I heard about it.  In fact whoever we saw in Belfast when we told them where we were staying all replied ""Nice Spot"".  Room and vibe were modern which some might not like but my group was on younger side.  The beds were so comfortable and the  bathrooms luxurious. Breakfast was excellant with cold and hot choices and the staff was very helpful and welcoming.  Bar was nice and comfortable lounge as well that will remind you of a home or library.  Overall great stay!",5,2019,04,13
226,Excellent,"A brilliant stay at this gorgeous hotel, staff was so welcoming and chocolates sent to our room shortly after arrival, a very tasty cocktail at the bar also with very nice service, overall a brilliant night stay at the fitzwilliam ",5,2019,04,13
226,Superb hotel,"I stayed at the Fitzwilliam Belfast Hotel for a business trip. I have never visited the hotel before, I would stay at the Fitzwilliam Belfast hotel again whether it is for business or personal stay.

A superb and relaxing stay, thank you Fitzwilliam Hotel for a great night sleep!",5,2019,04,12
226,Best turn down service,This hotel is fabulous.  The chocolates you get from the turn down service are a great touch. It is a short walk to many great activities and food.  The staff was very welcoming and made you feel just like home.,5,2019,04,12
226,Lovely hotel,"We stayed in this hotel for 2 nights during our stay in Belfast. First impressions were great, very professional and friendly staff welcoming us. The room itself was lovely, exactly as expected, very spacious, robes and slippers available to use. Bathroom was also very clean and some nice extra touches. Impressed by an evening turn down service, once again a very nice touch. 
Overall, would be happy to stay in the hotel again.",4,2019,04,11
226,Excellent Spring offer,"I booked direct through the hotels website and was pleased to receive a deal which included dinner, cocktails, overnight stay and breakfast for two. This was made even better when staff responded to insight of the reason for our stay (my partners 30th birthday) by upgrading our room- to one with an excellent view, and leaving a small birthday cake and message in the room. Fantastic food, great location, helpful staff, luxurious facilities and vallet parking. I'd recommend this hotel to others looking to enjoy a 5 * break and encourage you to check the hotels website for offers as our spring deal was very reasonable.",5,2019,04,11

226,Probably the best hotel I have ever stayed in,"Family weekend visit with a fly & hotel combo deal. OMG we lucked out completely. On arrival we were told we had been given an executive room. Outstanding decor and total attention to detail in every way.  Absolute 5 star feel complete with hand made tea bags cafterie, chocolate with bed turn down.. I could go on.  Bar area & entrance really stunning and staff give you the real Irish experience.  We didn't eat there as it was a family visit but sure it would be great. I can't recommend this hotel highly enough. Excellent 5 stars for me.",5,2019,04,08
226,Theatre Break,Hotel was in an excellent location for the Opera House where we were going in the evening. Very handy for local bars and restuarants.Had an executive king room which was very nice and spacious. Staff were very friendly. Bar was a bit quiet for a Friday but still had a warm feel about it. Breakfast was very nice.,5,2019,04,08
226,Excellent Hotel,"Just returned from a weekend in Belfast and I have to say that this has been the most welcoming and friendly hotel we have stayed in for a while. All staff greeted us with a smile and nothing was too much trouble. A hire car was organised for us with no problem.

The hotel is in a very good position and the rooms were very spacious with everything we would need for a comfortable stay. 

Overall a credit to the staff and management,",5,2019,04,08
226,Great experience,Concierge staff provided great tips for places to see and drive to. Genuinely friendly and not aloof like some can be on occasion. All staff were professional and smart and appeared to enjoy their their roles. Top class.,5,2019,04,08

226,Perfect hotel,"The room was beautiful, clean and had a fantastic view. The staff were brilliant and friendly. Breakfast was delicious and well varied.

226,Amazing,"Above and beyond. Staff are so friendly, clean, quiet and luxurious. 

Great bed, great bathroom and amazing food. 
I do wish the shower was slightly more powerful but otherwise I couldn‚Äôt fault it. 

9/10",5,2019,04,05
226,Wonderful Birthday Weekend!,We enjoyed a truly special weekend in Belfast made even more memorable by the comfort and excellent service we experienced at the Fitzwilliam. All staff were extremely helpful and courteous and  we would recommend the Friday night cocktail specials of 2 for 1! The city has a real energy and people are so friendly and welcoming.,5,2019,04,04
226,Lovely stay at The Fitzwilliam Hotel!,You really do get what you pay for in The Fitzwilliam Hotel. From the second you walk in the door you are treated with upmost respect. Our room was beautiful and spacious. Hotel right beside the train station and close to bars and restaurants in Belfast. All staff were so pleasant and our stay was top class. Safe to say we will definitely be back.,5,2019,04,03
226,Family get together.,"Perfect central hotel for exploring Belfast city. The staff were very friendly and helpful. The room was lovely and spacious, bright and stylish. The beds were so comfortable. Breakfast was delicious with great choice. Over all a great place to stay.",5,2019,04,03
226,Perfect and elegant,On arrival the greeting was very welcoming and the staff were all so talkative and lovely. Room was perfect and beautifully decorated. Also the cocktails were some of the best I‚Äôve had!! Will be definitely staying here every time I have trips away to Belfast.,5,2019,04,01
226,A great place to stay in Belfast,"Found the hotel to be very central for the bus/train station, the city centre and the Opera House. A great place to stay with very friendly and helpful staff. The service was excellent the breakfast was excellent with a very good choice. ",5,2019,04,01
226,Best in Belfast,"Enjoyed every minute of my time in the Fitzwilliam and will be visiting again, Great Staff, Great Place with a fantastic location and the Valet service is what stands out. Well done to all the team and see you again very soon. Superb.  ",5,2019,04,01
226,Fantastic experience!!,"We went for a Saturday night getaway. From the moment we arrived the staff were there to help with every need. Bags carried to the room, car taken and parked for us. A sneaky bottle of champagne with strawberries and cream was waiting in our room (free of charge) it was fantastic. We ate at the restaurant, it was fantastic and after a night out in the city we arrived back and drank late in the bar. The service was fantastic and cocktails were delish. We will be back for sure!!",5,2019,04,01
226,Poor bed,The master bed choice in our room was awful the floor was more comfortable the bed was so hard laying on the floor was easier  as you hope you are going to have a comfortable stay in such a great hotel on this occasion we were very unlucky and sore from the experience ,3,2019,04,01
226,Very decent. Not five star,"Rooms are small and awkwardly modernized to the point of boredom. If you go down to the pub, you‚Äôll find a better, more lively room. Friendly bar tenders that take their whiskey seriously. One instructed me since my grandfather was born in Louth, I should order Jameson‚Äôs. Had he been born in Antrim, I would have to order Bushmills. I also learned about liquor police that patrol to make sure they don‚Äôt skirt the pour. It‚Äôs s heavy fine or jail if they stiff you. Again, whiskey is very serious!",3,2019,03,31
226,Fantastic hotel,"After trying to find one of the best hotels in Belfast, decided to book through Booking.com Bed & Breakfast. Stayed for 3 nights checking in 27th Feb. Very good communications with the hotel prior to arrival.

From the outside the hotel seems small and is on a busy road, however, once inside very clean and opulently decorated. 

Great customer service from all staff who are very helpful and willing, spotless in all areas of the hotel including restaurant, plush rooms and brilliant breakfast to start the day. Breakfast is a choice of a large selection of cold items, cereals as well as a large selection of cooked to order items. I would highly recommend enjoying the breakfast by paying for it in advance as breakfast itself daily and the individual items cooked to order are very expensive if you were to pay daily and individually. 

Due to location, only issue is parking.

Would definitely recommend this hotel if you're after something a little special and would definitely consider staying here again if I visit Belfast again. Thank you for doing such a great job looking after us, definitely met our expectations in every way.",5,2019,03,31
226,Wonderful hotel,"I have just returned from a short break at The Fitzwilliam. I chose to stay as the hotel looked beautiful on the website, and happily this was true of real life. The rooms and guest areas are of excellent quality (and do not suffer from the ‚Äòslightly worn‚Äô look that is often the reality of hotels as compared to the glossy marketing images) and the staff were exceedingly polite, friendly and attentive. The bar served some of the best cocktails I have ever had, at very reasonable prices given the quality. The afternoon tea was also lovely. I would warn that the hotel is not situated in the prettiest of areas, however it is extremely central. For those not wishing to incur the expense of a cab from the airport, there is also a direct bus which stops just around the corner.",5,2019,03,29
226,Lovely overnight stay!,"Got treated to an overnight stay here by boyfriend. We had a fabulous time and will definitely be back! Staff were lovely and couldn‚Äôt do enough for you. Ciara at reception especially was very helpful. Arrived to be told we had been upgraded to a city view room and had a card and cake left in our room for me for my birthday! Brilliant location, easy walking distance to lots of restaurants and bars! ",5,2019,03,28
226,Best hotel in Belfast,I am so glad that I found this hotel . Very modern and the staff are very friendly . We found the hotel very comfortable and definitely deserves its 5 star rating . The only downside was the noise from our bedroom. ,5,2019,03,28
226,Travelling Druid,"Enjoyed my stay, and staff were excellent. Breakfast was excellent and the food in the bar was super. We felt very comfortable and at home and we will be back. Very central and easy to go anywhere in Belfast and we walked our feet off.
We preferred the bar menu rather than the restaurant as we felt it had a better choice and we were not dissappointed.
Staff had a good knowledge of shops and local pubs and where to go and were not afraid to voice opinions.",5,2019,03,27
226,Friendly & warm introduction to Belfast ,"Recently returned from a weekend trip to the Fitzwilliam Belfast. The hotel is conveniently located close to Donegall Square and a short walk from the shopping precinct (Victoria Square, CastleCourt etc.) We requested a higher floor room which had great views of the surrounding countryside and well appointed. The concierge (Declan) was excellent and offered advice in booking the black cab taxi tour (Brian Toal- which was highly recommended) and booked the game of thrones (coastline tour). Breakfast was excellent and had a very good continental breakfast offering as well as made to order items.  Overall a very pleasant stay at the Fitzwilliam and would recommend to anyone looking at booking either a business or personal trip to Belfast. We also received a friends recommendation to book a restaurant called Tedfords- the food was great and very reasonably priced!
",4,2019,03,26
226,Hen Party," Brilliant hotel with fantastic staff who go out of their way to help. I feel the price of the stay was overpriced purely down to the poor sleep quality  We were woken so many times. We were in room 214.",5,2019,03,25
226,Excellence in service!,"If people are the mark of a good hotel then the Fitzwilliam deserves its 5* rating. Amy in reservations got the ball rolling, arranging my booking in double quick time with buckets of laughter and local knowledge to get a quick but multi-purpose trip sorted. Reception were efficient and charming. The guys operating Concierge were brilliant - my check in and out were at awkward times around work commitments meaning my luggage and car required some attention - all was handled with careful detail and aplomb! The bedrooms and public areas are all as you would expect of a high end hotel but people make the real difference. Am happy to say, from my experience, the people I met understand the true meaning of happy service.",5,2019,03,24
226,Wedding anniversary ,"First visit to Belfast. Choose the Fitz William because of its location. Was not disappointed. Close to everything The buses, tours, pubs, restaurants all on doorstep 
The hotel was excellent. Friendly reception , excellent decor throughout and bedroom extremely comfortable. 
Breakfast menu extensive, selection for every one 
Will definitely return .

",5,2019,03,24
226,5 Star hotel except for their WiFi ,"Overall the hotel is very nice. The rooms, common area and service is 5*. The reason for my 4* rating and driving me to try another hotel is the terrible WiFi and cell service in some of their rooms. This has happened to me in three different rooms. Both the Virgin WiFi and the Fitzwilliam VIP worked. Being connected is mandatory for my business and I do not want to go the lobby all the time to do work. The other issue is the keys are very sensitive only work about 70% of the time. I don‚Äôt mind once in awhile, but this is way above the norm compared to other hotels. ",2,2019,03,23
226,Poor service ,"We were very disappointed and dissatisfied with our stay. We booked the 'Fitz is 10' package which included 2 birthdays cocktails, a welcome plate and breakfast. My experience started poorly and got worse from there. Firstly I did not feel extremely welcome as I would expect from a five star hotel. When we got our room cards given, the receptionist did not even mention to us how to obtain our free drinks, I had to ask her for them myself which she then handed me the free drink passes. I assumed you would be given an explanation as how to receive the item but it was just ignored and we were just sent directly to our room with no information.¬†

When we arrived to the room there was no welcome plate in sight and the bed didn't seem to be dressed properly. We then had to ring the reception and ask again for our welcome plate which was then delivered an hour later.¬†

Not being from around Belfast we weren't sure on where we were able to get dinner so we'd came down to reception and asked the consierge, we were told most places in Belfast are closed on Mondays and given no other recommendations or options.¬†

We decided then to avail of dinner in the hotel bar, it then also turned out to be a let down.¬†

Both being vegetarian we were pointed out the suitable dishes. I had ordered the curry and my partner ordered the mushroom risotto on the special, both dishes were bland and contained a majority of rice with very little evidence of any vegetables. Later on in the night we took advantage of the radio system in our room, reception called and we were asked to turn the volume down which was reasonable and we informed them that they may call is at any time if despite being turned down, it is still too loud. While relaxing in the bath we were interrupted by a knock on the door, a member of staff which I found unpleasantly rude came to warn us about the volume which yes is understandable but it not being very loud, he told me I was disturbing other guests and lifted the 'do not disturb' tag off out neighbours door and stuck it in my face. I was upset in the matter.
I emailed management to which they replied with a vague apology. 

",1,2019,03,22
226,Incredible hotel and staff,"Despite being cold, the staff were the warmest I‚Äôve ever met. The hotel is exquisitely beautiful. Lunch and breakfast was amazing. I definitely recommend. Quite affordable in my opinion as well. Belfast has won me over.",5,2019,03,22
226,Great place,"We did not stay for a night just for a meal and drinks during congress. Great place, great atmosphere. Toilets were very clean. Nice location. Helpful staff when asked to book a taxi. For us a very good location.",5,2019,03,21
226,Nice hotel but not quite 5 star,Had quite a nice stay but the hotel is not quite 5 star. The hotel decor is in need of updating and there was quite a bit of road noise at night leading to an average night's sleep. The staff were extremely helpful and the breakfast was very good too. More a 4 star hotel than 5,4,2019,03,20
226,High Tea with the family,"Had a wonderful experience last Sunday at the Fitzwilliam Hotel for high tea with the family.  2 adults and 2 kids had a great time, and bonus as the rugby was on!  We ate well, had some cocktails and left in great spirits- would fully recommend.",5,2019,03,19
226,Perfect for work,Stayed at the fitzwilliam hotel in Belfast. It was a work trip for 1 night. Location of the hotel is very central. Rooms well appointed. Room service very good.  Valet parking was very convienient. I had forgotten something in the room and it was found and put into my car before I even noticed I had left it behind ! Very grateful for that.,4,2019,03,19
226,Beautiful,1st time in this hotel. Afternoon tea was scrumptious with a Christmas theme including mugs of mulled wine and candy canes. Service was excellent and food aplenty for 2 people. Friendly and helpful staff and beautiful surroundings.,5,2019,03,19
226,Amazing city break,We spent 2 nights in this hotel. The bed was really comfortable and the room so quiet that we 2 night of perfect sleep. The Location is great 5 minutes walking from the city hall and loads of places to eat around here. The breakfast was tasty. ,5,2019,03,19
226,A great stay,We cannot fault anything at all about our stay. Great room and really friendly staff along with a brilliant location. Loved the decor and style aspects too. Breakfast was superb with a huge amount of choice. We‚Äôll certainly be back!,5,2019,03,19
226,Great staff and beautiful hotel,"I was treated to an overnight stay at the Fitzwilliam for my birthday and what birthday it was. From the very warm and genuine welcome at the front door and at reception to the great staff in the bar and restaurant. The rooms are beautiful with a great view of Belfast.  

The bar staff were very knowledgeable about their cocktails, which were amazing.  After a comfortable nights sleep, breakfast was gorgeous. There was something for everyone on the menu and lots of other nice additions to pick up.  

Can‚Äôt wait to return. Thanks to the Fitz team!",5,2019,03,18
226,Great weekend away,"We stayed at the Fitzwilliam hotel, great location for a weekend to get out and about. The hotel staff are a credit to the hotels reputation. The rooms are very comfortable with all you need. We didn't eat in the hotel other than breakfast however I would try the restaurant on our next visit.
 
The bar area on Saturday evening had live music which was good to relax in unfortunately it can get busy and a lack of seating spaces may force you to stand at the bar. There is a row of booth seating which I always feel is a waste of space as 2 people sitting on what is a space for 4-6 people is not the best idea. The area would be better served with tables and chairs only....

I would recommend the hotel to anyone      ",4,2019,03,18
226,"Amazing sophisticated hotel, at the town centre","A brilliant hotel at the town centre, very close to all the main areas of interest. Great location, in fact, right opposite a 140 year old pub, a local landmark. The hotel is amazing! Big well appointed comfortable rooms and a great breakfast cooked to order! Will stay again!",5,2019,03,17
226,Great restaurant service,"Restaurant review only: Group of eight having dinner before attending a show in the Opera House. The quiet atmosphere of the restaurant provides a nice ambience for friends to chat, complimented by a very reasonable and very good pre-theatre menu.

Big thank you to Anna (and her team) for her polite, fast and efficient service which really got our evening off to an amazing start. She is a great asset to the hotel and her professional, friendly manner was appreciated by all of our group. Such skills are sadly lacking in much of the hospitality sector these days. Well done Anna. (Management - please take note.)",5,2019,03,16
226,Amazing hotel,"Visited Belfast for a business/leisure trio with my wife and 11 yr old daughter. I certainly made the right choice with the Fitz William, had the wow factor. Apart from the room, restaurant, bar, cleanliness, the food and the attention to detail it was the staff that made the hotel, thug really were the best I‚Äôve ever come across especially Nathan the concierge who seemed to know what you wanted even before you‚Äôd finished the question.
My lite girl wasn‚Äôt very well for the duration of the trip and we weren‚Äôt able to meet up with friends as planned so the whole trip would‚Äôve been a disaster if it wasn‚Äôt for the hotel. 
I think any other hotel will such a let down after the Fitz William, it really was that nice...really looking forward to staying there again...thank you",5,2019,03,15
226,Cocktail making Hen Party,"Hen day was Saturday 9 March and about 20 of us arrived en masse at the Fitzwilliam Hotel for cocktail making just before 5pm.
Unlike my last experience here where all the girls spent the evening standing in a little alcove off the downstairs bar, we were all guided to the 5th floor (I think) and into a private room which in my opinion was much better.

There was a large table in the centre of the room - this was almost set up. An individual seat for everyone; various glasses, measures, drainers etc. had all been positioned very carefully and in perfect lines. We had arrived a little early (which I expect is a rare experience for the hotel), and I for one was relieved to find there was a seat at the table for each of us. We chatted whilst we waited for the last few touches to be completed and then we were invited to take our seats.

I‚Äôm sorry that I can‚Äôt give a personal mention to the cocktail man ‚Äòwith the ‚Äòology,‚Äô but I will add that his sense of humour was just perfect for our group- he wasn‚Äôt too risk-eh, but neither was he boring, and his ‚Äòshake‚Äô was better than Stevens (lol)!!

We were given a brief synopsis of what was to happen - he would make a cocktail first (it was one with blackberries) and pass it to the bride to drink whilst he took us all step by step as we each made our own!!

If I were asked to make a suggestion to improve the hen cocktail making experience, I would be inclined to suggest  our ‚Äòcocktologist‚Äô makes a request for assistance between the 1st cocktail session and the next. It seemed to take for ever (despite the great craic) for all the gear to be removed and replaced and make ready for our 2nd / last drink. 

My 2nd recommendation would be that the ‚Äò Bar chef,"" ""liquid chef,"" or ""mixologist"" considers bringing another person on board to assist whilst the group are enjoying the making experience ....... whilst no-one was in a hurry another person (even a bar tender) could assist one side of the table. It takes such a long time for one person to check there will be no spillages and moving along just a little bit quicker would mean the hens don‚Äôt need to wait for one person to make their way around the table to give guidance.

Some of us would have liked to take away information to remind us what alcohol & items we need should we decide to make another cocktail at home / in the future - but that said, we all had a great time. 

Hopefully I will receive another invite to cocktail making in the future and if there is a larger party (18 +) even one of my suggestions will have been taken on board??

The craic was good üòÄü•Ç",5,2019,03,15
226,Amazing beautiful hotel!,Everything was incredible from the staff to the facility's top class hotel!! Lovely layout of the room and breakfast was delicious and a very good range of food to choose from and the little added extras was great ,5,2019,03,13
226,Best afternoon tea in town,"I took my daughter for afternoon tea to thank her for driving me after a recent accident. I thought the standard tea was ¬£25 each but my first, pleasant surprise, was that the non champagne version is ¬£20 per person.
For that we had a tray of hot savouries, a demitasse of soup, pulled pork crouton and mozzarella churro, all delicious. This was followed by a great selection of fresh sandwiches. The scones were fresh, crumbly and plain, which I think are best with jam and clotted cream. The selection of sweet bites was fantastic and we had to take many items home. Lorraine ensured a constant supply of hot tea and all staff took time to chat and check in. As I have injured my back, Lorraine ensured I had extra cushions and was as comfortable as possible. All in all, this was a wonderful experience and I would rate the afternoon tea as the best in Belfast. ",5,2019,03,13
226,"This hotel was just the best, friendly staff beautiful room and central to everything",My 1st time at the hotel but definitely not my last. Everything was amazing üëåI felt like a queen üëë everything was perfect and all the added extras were a bonus. All staff were so helpful and friendly. ,5,2019,03,12
226,First Class Hotel,"Stayed over on a Monday evening to see a show in the Opera House, next door.

Reception staff were excellent bags taken straight away and delivered to our room. Jara on reception gave us a warm welcome and promised us a lovely room. She is a credit to the hotel the sort of person who sets a great tone for you stay.

Our room was excellent - looked very new with every amenity you could want. The view (ask for for a room on one if the top floors) had an incredible view over Belfast, the Black Mountain and the Cavehill. We brought drinks up from the bar and enjoyed the view late in the afternoon.

The hotel is very central to the City Centre with plenty of bars and restaurants near by.

Breakfast was first class a nice end to our stay.

Highly recommend the Fitzwilliam if staying in Belfast.",5,2019,03,12
226,Stay,Best hotel in Belfast! By far! Everything was perfect staff were lovely they really do go above and beyond for guests. Meal was beautiful in the hotel aswel. Our second time there and we will be back! ,5,2019,03,11
226,"Great Hotel, Great Location","Great hotel, cant fault any part of the entire stay & if I return to Belfast again I will without doubt stay here again.
Room was amazing, had a corner room so very good views & beautiful bathroom.
All staff were very helpful & polite, bar staff made our cocktails even though they weren't on the menu & they had a lot of fun with us making them too.
Bar manager (James) was also very helpful with local info & recommendations of food & cocktails. Everyone here seems to know their stuff!!",5,2019,03,11
226,loved it,Apart of a birthday surprise for my partner. Had a lovely time.  My partner received a birthday note and desert which was a lovely touch. Staff was friendly and helpful. Also had a nice view from the room.,5,2019,03,11
226,Enjoyable  stay,"Excellent location for bus station , shopping and pubs. 
The staff were all very nice , the breakfast choice was very good   the bedroom was well appointed and of a good size  but the light switches were confusing",5,2019,03,11
226,Def recommended,Rooms were top class def 5 star rating with all the litt lke trimmings in the room! Would rec this hitel for a special occasion. Didnt eat in the resturant but breakfast was so fresh and had so much variety.Very central and staff were v welcoming Def would go back!!,5,2019,03,10
226,Fantastic Stay,"Stayed here for 3 nights from 1st of March. From arriving at the hotel we were made to feel very welcome. The staff could not have been more friendly.

Rooms. Very spacious and clean and could not fault them.

Restaurant. We dined here the first night and the food was very good. Quite expensive for what you got but nice.

Bar. We spent most our nights in the bar as the weather was not great so did not want to venture out. The service was fantastic and all bar staff were extremely friendly and helpful. A good selection of drinks and good quality drinks served. We ordered some light bites and these were very nice and the kitchen catered for a gluten free diet.

Staff. Have to say every staff member was polite and friendly and this really stood out to us and made our stay what it was. We struggled to get into a restaurant on the Saturday night. Spoke to  concierge (Declan) and within 5 minutes he had us booked into the restaurant we had requested. 

We would definitely like to return to Belfast and when we do we will definitely book this hotel! ",5,2019,03,10
226,Awesome,"We had such a lovely stay that we didn't go out. Just used the bar and restaurant in the hotel. A fantastic stay. The best hotel stay we have had so far, such friendly and polite staff. We will be back.",5,2019,03,10
226,Amazing stay as always,Love the Fitzwilliam. No other hotel in Belfast compares! Have stayed here several times over the years and always really look forward to coming. The staff are always so lovely and the food etc cannot be compared. ,5,2019,03,10
226,Beautiful but thin walls and noisy rooms,"Gorgeous hotel, welcoming staff. Especially loved the Nespresso machinesl in the room and room view. However, my partner did not sleep at all because walls are thin and our room was directly across from a maintenance room where staff went in and out slamming the door constantly. Would be a 5 star review otherwise!",4,2019,03,09
226,Fabulous hotel,"Stayed for 2 nights on business and found the amazing.
From checking in to checking out nothing was too much trouble.
The rooms are spacious and very comfortable and I love all the little extras.
The beds are comfortable and the turndown service with the little chocolates is a lovely touch.
This is a fabulous hotel centrally located with great staff.",5,2019,03,09
226,Excellent stay,"Stayed for 2 nights in February for my birthday and really enjoyed this hotel. Decor throughout is fab and the rooms very clean and really comfortable. We ate in the bar on night 1 and really enjoyed the food, my steak was under done but rectified immediately and not affecting my rating. Staff throughout couldn't have been friendlier or done more for us. The breakfast selection is fantastic and we really enjoyed the cooked items we ordered. The sole reason for 4 star rating was room service on day 2 after asking the hotel for pizza recommendations they recommended the room service so after a long day out we felt a bit lazy and took this option, as an absolute pizza lover I was super disappointed üò¢  all in all a great stay and I would definitely recommend ",4,2019,03,08
226,fantastic hotel in a fantastic location,"I spent 2 days recently in the Fitzwilliam and I had a fabulous stay. The concierge service is 2nd to none, in fact all the staff went out their way to be helpful and make my stay memorable. The rooms are spacious and have large comfortable beds, I also could not believe how quiet the room was. Breakfast was varied and tasty and they serve the best poached eggs. I look forward to returning to the Fitzwilliam when I am next in Belfast.",5,2019,03,07
226,5 Star service from the moment we stepped out the taxi,"Just as the title says, our stay began the moment we stepped out from the taxi and were greeted by the lovely staff, who kindly took our cases into the hotel. We had arrived at about 9am, far before the standard check-in time as we had business to deal with first. Only expecting to leave the cases to collect later, we were surprised to be accomodated instantly and welcomed to a stunning room on the 2nd floor.

Our cases travelled with us and the kind staff showed us around the room and explained all of it's features and important things about the hotel. The room itself was stunning, with an extremely comfortable bed, sofa, tea & coffee making facilities along with a seperate bath and shower in the ensuite. 

Breakfast was included with our room and a short ride down to the first floor brought us to their award winning restaurant. You can choose to eat from the continental buffet along with ordering hot food made to order from the kitchen, the eggs benedict is highly recommended! 

Staff couldn't do enough throughout every aspect of the stay, from the guest services who handed us complimentary boxes of chocolates just after dinner and a turn down service. If you're looking for a little bit of luxury during your stay, for a very affordable price, the Fitzwilliam is the perfect choice.",5,2019,03,07
226,Boutique Hotel in Belfast,"The Fitzwilliam Hotel was located next to Opera Hotel. 5mins walk to City Hall and about 12mins to Victoria Square. Surrounding not much things and not much choice restaurants available. Ideal location for Aircoach pickup/dropoff bus station behind Opera House.Hannon Coach to UK pickup at City Hall about 5 mins walk from the hotel.
Check in process a bit slow,was requested to pay a desposit via credit card and transaction was actually get thru. The staff even requested me to sign on the transaction slip! Thats a bit ridiculous.
Assign room was not as big as shown on website. But consider ok. Equip with all necessary amenities, safe ,iron facilities, fridge etc. Large comfortable double bed. Room lighting a bit dim and surrounded by mirror with black stains.
Breakfast was ok. Select a main dishes from menu and help yourself with  the buffet style continetal breakfast. Coffee really need to improve.
Overall, stay consider ok just that not much entertainment (shopping and dinning) choice available nearby. Took nearly 30mins to/from to Victoria Square during my 3 night stay.",4,2019,03,07
226,Lovely stay,"Stayed here for one night, nice hotel, dropped luggage early as room wasn‚Äôt ready. We had a executive king room, really comfortable nights sleep. Great location. Nice bar downstairs too. Would certainly stay again. ",5,2019,03,07
226,Comfortable stay no problems,"A good 5* standard. We used valet parking which was efficient and convenient. The room was a bit cramped for a luxury room and when we arrived and the heating was on full and felt a bit like a sauna, classic fm was on the radio which was a nice touch. The bed was quite firm and not as comfortable as usually get for 5*s. 

The bathroom facilities were nice with bath and shower. I prefer a separate toilet area but because of the limited space it wouldn‚Äôt be possible. Standard set of amenities.

Nice turn down service but no slippers. So overall I think an average 5* (not luxury) and a few small modifications could make it a lot better. ",4,2019,03,07
226,Birthday Treat,"Sunday night stay, beautiful room and very comfortable bed.
Every possible thing in your room that you might need and more.
Eggs benedict for breakfast, sure what more could you want. Can't wait to return.",5,2019,03,06
226,Perfect hotel,Had a lovely stay here recently. All staff are very friendly and helpful. Rooms are well decorated and cleaned to a high standard. Breakfast each morning was plentiful and delicious and is well worth paying for. The only negative was having to pay ¬£55 for 2 days parking in the multi story around the corner as the hotel car park was full,5,2019,03,06
226,Best Boutique Hotel in Belfast,"A fabulous hotel to stay in if you are on a city break or business trip. Friendly staff, tastefully decorated, great food and drinks and even the afternoon tea is well worth the calories! 
The bedrooms are spacious and well equipped and the service is immaculate. We‚Äôve stayed in most hotels in Belfast and this sits at the top so far for value for money and friendliness.",5,2019,03,06
226,Murder Mystery Night,Brilliant work team night out at the Murder Mystery event last Friday.  Hotel took care of all our needs and the Play Dead actors were fantastic.  Would really recommend this for a great night out for any occasion.,5,2019,03,05
226,Fabulous hotel..... no faults at all from start to finish,Fabulous hotel. Decor is fab. Food etc was delicious and service was perfect. Ambiance was amazing! Staff very helpful and welcoming.  No complaints at all and enough highly recommend. Would def go back if going to Belfast ,5,2019,03,04
226,Friendly staff great location small family room.,Bed was very uncomfortable I could feel every spring. Room was clean and staff were friendly but the room was very cramped and as a family for 4 we had practically no room to move. Great location but room size and bed comfort the biggest let down ,3,2019,03,04
226,Anniversary stay,"Fantastic hotel and staff. On arrival we had a personalised card wishing us a happy anniversary from the hotel manager, a really nice touch. All the staff were very good, we had breakfast in bed on the Sunday morning and the room service was brilliant. Looking forward to our next stay!",5,2019,03,04
226,Fantastic,"Fantastic hotel, hotels were amazing, evening better at happy hour when they are 2 for 1.
Food In restaurant and breakfast was very tasty.
Central hotel, close to shops, bars and train station.
Staff went over and above. ",5,2019,03,03
226,Impeccable service in exquisite surroundings.,"From the moment I pulled my car up to the hotel, we were treated like VIP's. Staff were attentive, friendly & profesdional. The hotel is aesthetically pleasing & has a wonderful welcoming atmosphere. We will definitely return",5,2019,03,03
226,Great Hotel,Really lovely hotel in the heart of Belfast. Very easy access to everything. Very helpful staff and beautiful rooms. Breakfast was excellent with plenty of food choices. Ate dinner at the bar one evening and was quite good. ,5,2019,03,02
226,Excellent business Hotel,"I‚Äôd so like to have given 5 stars, it‚Äôs a fabulous modern building with great, well appointed rooms in a super location. Reception staff and in fact all staff were very friendly and efficient, nearly all were Irish which shows great authenticity. In fact everyone we met were great emissaries for Irish hospitality. There was just something missing which meant we couldn‚Äôt see it as a 5 star Hotel. A superb 4 star yes. Both the bar and restaurant were a bit clinical. Slight dull background hum in bedroom and a surprising amount of road noise considering we were on 9th floor. Certainly for a business visit superb.",4,2019,03,01
226,Amazing Hotel,"Fabulous hotel, all the staff members were friendly and professional. Our room was spacious and luxurious. 
The bathroom had a big bath and big shower and a heated rail. The bed was sooo comfortable as were the pillows. The food was delicious in the bar area and breakfast in the restaurant was a treat for the eyes (cute little smoothie bottles with freshly prepared smoothie and cute little granola pots with fresh fruit) and the cooked breakfast was superb. Our stay was a gift from our two sons and we thoroughly enjoyed our stay from check in to check out - our boys made an excellent choice. ",5,2019,02,28
226,Business stay,"The Fitzwilliam Hotel is an excellent place to stay in the heart of Belfast. There is easy access if driving and a valet service from outside for parking. The staff are very attenuative and nothing seems too much trouble. The rooms are clean and modern with every facility you need including free Wi-Fi. There's a good choice at breakfast, lunch and dinner in the bar and restaurant",5,2019,02,28
226,Beyond expectations.,"Warm and friendly staff, they make you feel welcome from the first moments. The concierge remembered my name and would welcome me back on my return to the hotel, a nice touch. Food and room service both excellent and the rooms themselves were luxurious. Highly enjoyed my two night stay. ",5,2019,02,27
226,First class hotel,"Centrally located with absolutely fantastic staff, I can not recommend this hotel highly enough. 

The rooms are spacious and have everything that you need. I had a separate bath and shower which is so much better than having one or the other.

This is currently Belfast‚Äôs newest Five Star hotel and they clearly intend to stay ahead of the game.",5,2019,02,27
226,Excellent,"Had a lovely stay here to finish off my 30th birthday celebrations, will certainly be back for another stay, clean, very comfortable & staff were really friendly & helpful, did not want to leave & can not wait for another stay ",5,2019,02,26
226,Excellent personal service in a luxurious hotel,"Amazing stay in this hotel, we were treated like VIPs by Cian the manager and his team who all went above and beyond to make our stay special. Room was fabulous and the facilities also. Valet parking and luggage service. ",5,2019,02,26
226,Lovely Stay,"We were in Belfast for a long weekend and wanted to stay as central as we could. The Fitzwilliam is certainly that! We were in the heart of the city and within walking distance of lots of the sights. The room was modern and had everything that you would expect from a 5* hotel. The room was spacious and clean, and we enjoyed the little touches, the candle and matches in the bathroom to enjoy a soak after a long day sightseeing and the turn down service with the little chocolates and the weather forcast for the following day. We also ordered room service on our first night which was very nice! 

The only downside to the hotel is that it is on a main road and can seem quite noisy at night.The hotel had thought about this though and there were ear plugs in the room which did a great job! 

I would definatley reccommend the Fitzwilliam!",5,2019,02,26
226,Fabulous,"A great hotel. Dinner in bar was lovely. And very reasonably priced. As were the drinks.  The breakfast was the nicest I've had. We will be back. The room decor was lovely. Room was well lit with ample mirrors. The concierge was extremely polite and helpful, taking cases up to the room. ",5,2019,02,26
226,"Great service, location, and room...","I did a lot of research prior to booking and still held my breath when I arrived since we were coming from the USA.  The bellman treated us like he had been waiting just for us, and our room was wonderful.  The bed was comfy and I thought the location was great.  I would recommend this hotel.  ",5,2019,02,25
226,Winter warmer package,Staff could not do enough for us. Superb hotel. Will def be back. Only complaint was our room was directly facing the lift so we heard everyone coming in on the sat night. If we were staying more than one night would have asked to change. ,5,2019,02,25
226,Only ok...,"As five star hotels go it just felt like something was lacking. It didn‚Äôt have that five star feel. The room was fine but a little tired and in need of some tlc (e.g. crack in the toilet bowl). 

On arrival we pulled into the set down area temporarily to check in and enquire about parking. The doorman/concierge came out to the car to ask us to move, we asked about parking and he said you should have booked in advance. This wasn‚Äôt made clear to us at the time of booking. He wasn‚Äôt helpful or pleasant but offered us a place in their carpark at ¬£25 per night which we took as we felt under pressure to move.

The male receptionist was lovely and very helpful on check in and check out. As was the bar manager who took payment and cleared our table after dinner. 

We wanted a quick, late bite to eat in the bar after a longish drive but ended up waiting about 40 mins for our food after ordering. The waitress unapologetically explained that it was due to the restaurant being busy upstairs and that there‚Äôs usually at least a 25 min wait for food in the bar anyway so we should expect to wait. We were then assured it wouldn‚Äôt be much longer by another waitress who overheard and interjected to apologise.

Breakfast was very good but the style of the restaurant wasn‚Äôt to our taste. It‚Äôs a matter of preference but we were glad we hadn‚Äôt eaten there the night before as it felt like more of a casual dining experience than what you would expect from a hotel of this level.

I don‚Äôt think we would go back to be honest.",3,2019,02,24
226,City Break,"Top class hotel, staff are very friendly and efficient. Food for both our dinner and breakfast was second to none. Have stayed in another 5*  hotel just outside Belfast and have to say the Fitzwilliam was much better. Definitely recommend if you are staying in BelfastüòÅ",5,2019,02,24
226,good rooms,"i stayed in the Fitzwilliam for three nights while i'm having a conference running in Europa hotel which is adjacent to it. executive room was pleasantly decorated in black. bed comfort was ok. and i really loved the yellow sofa which gave a very artistic look in the room. the view wasn't special but remember this is a city center hotel. 
location was perfect near all attractions and restaurants. another advantage is that most of the tour operators. both room and bathroom were nicely kept and super clean. 
breakfast staff were extremely nice and helpful. breakfast had very nice cook for order dishes.",4,2019,02,24
226,A bit of luxury for new parents,"We stayed at the Fitzwilliam Hotel on our way to the airport with our 10month old daughter. All of the staff that we met were friendly and accommodating. Everyone was helpful and took the time to say hello to our daughter. The room was spacious enough for a crawler to explore and comfortable and treat worthy for mum and dad
The food we had was absolutely delicious on both the evening meal and breakfast service.
We would highly recommend the Fitzwilliam Hotel as a destination to stay in Belfast",5,2019,02,23
226,Mediocre meal ,"We were really looking forward to an evening in the Fitzwilliam. Check in friendly, Room very nice, meal mediocre. Residents dining gives a more limited choice so we both went for steak (at a supplement). Flavours were good but steaks were very tough. We were more hopeful about desert but baked apple was rock hard and panna cotta was like a block of cheddar. I would like to say service made up for it but Fawlty Towers comes to mind. We don‚Äôt like to be negative but overall very disappointed on what was meant to be a special weekend üòï",3,2019,02,23
226,Very comfortable and friendly. Staff were amazing nothing too much trouble. Breakfast had plenty of choice.,Really enjoyed Belfast. Fitzwilliam ideally placed for all local attractions. All staff made you feel welcome and were very helpful from day one. It was a pleasure to see how happy staff were showing a well run establishment ,5,2019,02,23
226,Disappointing.,"Just spent the week at this hotel and we are surprised it has 5 star rating. We arrived early so not a  problem rooms were not ready so we went off out having been told our rooms were put on priority.Very nice receptionist, got all our paperwork ready. Came back much later and still not ready but didnt mind  because check in officially 15.00. Sat in reception area at only table available which had piles of dishes from previous guests. Dishes were still there when we left 45 minutes later. When my friend went to reception to get our room keys the young man made a big deal of giving her the room keys, wanting to know who the second room had been booked under. He was the rudest person I have ever encountered on a reception desk. This was on the afternoon of 18th Feb so he knows who he is. Needs a course on how to speak to people. I work in a hospital and if I treated a person at reception the way he treated us I would expect a major complaint.
The room at first impression was nice, however, kettle had no socket nearby and had to be boiled on floor which is rather dangerous. To use hairdryer near a  mirror we had to pull table out which had television on  and pull lamp plug out in order to use it. Lighting in room was dreadful.Glasses we used were not washed. I could say more  but on a positive note the rest of the staff were very professional and so nice. Shame the one on reception that day spoiled it for all the others.",3,2019,02,22
226,Great hotel,"Had a lovely 3 night stay, lovely room, friendly welcoming staff. Great location. 
Only issue that's little annoying is that there is very limited car parking, we had to use general city multistory, no discount for guests. Found the parking expensive.",4,2019,02,22
226,Would definitely recommend,"Stayed at the Fitzwilliam for 2 nights and was very happy that we had chosen to stay here. From the moment we arrived the service from all the staff was fantastic. We were made to feel welcome immediately and we were well looked after. We ate in the restaurant one of the nights. The food was delicious. This hotel is very central so a perfect place to stay for exploring the city.  The rooms are comfortable, spacious and very well equipped. All in all would definitely recommend.",5,2019,02,22
226,Excellent hotel.,"Wonderful hotel, with excellent staff and accommodation.  Our room was extremely comfortable. Evening meal was delicious and breakfast in the morning had everything that anyone could possibly require.  Hope to stay here again soon. ",5,2019,02,21
226,1st  class hotel,"Beautiful 1st class hotel central Belfast,perfect location.Rooms luxurious and they have thought of everything.warm decor,breakfast delicious and great range of foods.Cant recommend it enough.will be back",5,2019,02,21
226,Luxurious night in Belfast.,Simply the best hotel in Belfast. We only stayed 1 night but wow how impressive the Fitzwilliam is. From room to the bar to the most wonderful breakfast in any hotel (real honeycomb honey) I cant praise it enough. Its our 3rd time there + we cant wait to return.,5,2019,02,20
226,Anniversary Trip ,"Brilliant location, hotel was beautiful and staff (and everyone we met in Belfast) were so lovely. 
We arrived 2 hours early expecting just to drop off cases and hang around however our room was ready and it was no problem to check in early. The concierge was great and the guy showed us to our room and was very knowledgeable and enthusiastic about what to do in Belfast. 
Originally we had booked into the George Best hotel months ago to find it still isn‚Äôt open which put a slight damper on our expectations for our trip but we enjoyed every moment of our 2 night stay here and will definitely return to the Fitzwilliam and the friendliest city I have ever visited.
",5,2019,02,20
226,wonderful venue and staff,"so sorry for the late review..
we had booked to stay with you January Not only is this a beautiful hotel, comfortable and well maintained hotel, the staff concierge Gerard and team very helpful the  service was brilliant nothing was to much for him he carried out bags shopping spoke to kind to us knows a lot about the town. we had food in the bar served to myself, my mother and her friend - every effort was made to make my dining companions feel special. There were special circumstances as my mother didn't want to eat in the restaurant so Gerard offered other restaurants in Belfast close by plus the bar food in the hotel that was so lovely  I‚Äôve been several times for afternoon tea or lunch and the level of service and consideration never diminishes. A wonderful venue and great sport to visit Belfast,",5,2019,02,20
226,Lovely central hotel ,"My husband booked this for our 10th wedding anniversary, so we wanted something special. 

The warm welcome from the moment we arrived was lovely, we didn‚Äôt realise we had to book the parking but they managed to fit our car in (¬£25 a night). 

The reception/concierge/bar staff were all lovely, friendly and helpful.

The room was lovely and spacious.
We had drinks and a bar snack in the bar which we enjoyed. 

Very central hotel, shopping within walking distance.

However the one negative for us unfortunately was the breakfast...we were served our tea, but had to wait an age to place our Oder then waiting a further 30mins for the food to arrive...by this time we‚Äôd drank the tea and just wanted to eat and run....it wasent up to much either, tiny amount of scrambled egg which left me hungry.

Apart from this we loved the place and would return but wouldent bother with the breakfast. ",4,2019,02,19
226,The Luxury is Worth What You Pay,"Simply incredible this hotel is luxury in every way, the facilities are of very good quality, very good food and above all the warmth and friendliness of the hotel employees, each and every one of them are amazing people, the location is amazing, everything is close, congratulations to this hotel.",5,2019,02,19
226,Superb location for a night at the Opera House but very slow service nearly spoiled the show.,"For anyone travelling into the Europa Bus terminal and planning to catch a show at the Grand Opera House, this hotel location is unbeatable. Rooms are well furnished, beds comfortable, not too firm not too soft but just right. The corridors are a bit dark and the lifts not as fast as most 5 star hotels. 

My wife and I had booked St Valentine's dinner for 5.30pm in the restaurant leaving us lots of time for the very short journey next door to see The Bodyguard starting at 7.30pm. Or so we thought!

The restaurant had quite a few couples waiting patiently but by 6.40pm our main meal, we wanted main and dessert, had not appeared! The couple beside us had had a starter but they were also anxious about the show time looming. At almost 6.45pm the main arrived and it was delicious. My wise wife immediately ordered our desserts and coffee so there was no subsequent delay and we finished our meal by ten past seven. 
The couple beside us however found the main meal when it finally appeared to be too late to be eaten with proper time and to be enjoyed in a relaxed manner.

 We got our seats in time and enjoyed the show especially the female star. And indeed next morning the breakfast display was excellent and the service quite good though more 3 star than 5. This is the problem with 5 star expectation, everything has to be great all the time. Perhaps the chef was having an off night or perhaps even a night off but if the Valentine's meal experience is poor, it spoils the whole evening. With so many good hotels in Belfast and so many excellent restaurants there is no room for complacency. Though the quality of the food was excellent, this was a one star restaurant performance and just not good enough for a hotel claiming to be the best.",3,2019,02,19
226,Special occasion- Afternoon tea,"Myself and 20 others visited the restaurant on the 2nd Feb for afternoon tea as part of a hen party. I had suggested then Fitzwilliam as I had previously stayed here and at that time really enjoyed my stay. However this is a suggestion I now regret!! We arrived for afternoon tea at 3:30, we had almost 20 minutes to wait before we had our tea poured, then a further 10/15 minutes before the first course of afternoon tea arrived. After the first course there was a delay of 30/40 minutes before the remainder of the food arrived. When it did eventually arrive the bread on all of the sandwiches was hard/stale, the scones were also hard!! We spoke to a member of staff who stated that the sandwiches had been made a few hours before and that the scones were indeed fresh (they weren‚Äôt!). One member of the group requested the gluten free option and her sandwiches were appalling, they looked like they had been left sitting out overnight! Eventually they brought us some freshly made sandwiches. I was highly disappointed with the service we received, we have visited a number of different locations in Belfast for afternoon in the past that have been incredible and in the future will return to those establishments. To add to the poor experience I emailed Fitzwilliam directly to air my concerns and they have not responded or even acknowledged my email!!",1,2019,02,19
226,Beautiful Room,"We stayed in a beautiful suite as a treat and spent a lot of time in our room, we could of spent more time there due to the layout and comfort, not to mention the view of the city, especially at night",4,2019,02,19
226,Great location and very friendly,"Visited for the weekend. A really lovely hotel with great amenities and in a perfect location for all parts of Belfast. Staff were friendly and helpful and the room was very well equipped. If there was one thing I would complain.about it was breakfast on Sunday. We had to wait nearly 20 minutes for a table and then nearly 35 minutes for our breakfast to arrive. When it did...it was cold! They did take it back immediately but it really wasn‚Äôt great. A real shame as it would‚Äôve been a 5* review if this hadn‚Äôt happened. All that said, I would stay there again.",4,2019,02,18
226,Great hotel ,"Stayed here Friday 15th Feb for one night . The hotel is in a great location near all shops, bars etc . Rooms are beautiful and very clean . All staff especially the concierge are very friendly and helpful . Will definitely stay here again on my next trip to Belfast ",5,2019,02,18
226,Very high standard of service and highly recommend,"It‚Äôs difficult to say who exemplified the values of the Fitzwilliam more. Francis the wonderful driver, Declan the doorman/concierge, Jason in reception, the lovely girl with short hair who kept checking we were okay (sorry I didn‚Äôt get her name, but she may be polish) the chap who came up to fix our sink at 10.30 pm, the restaurant staff, the bar staff, in fact everyone! Truly unique that each member of the team wanted to ensure we were being well cared for. It‚Äôs been a very long time since I‚Äôve experienced that level of service. The Merchant could learn a thing or two. Well done to whoever it is that found these people and continues to motivate them to provide such excellent service. I‚Äôll be back",5,2019,02,18
226,Weekend Break for couples,"Excellent location , a little noisy at night due to location but thats what you get for city centre. Walking distance from great restaurants and all the things you want to see. SUPER good staff, concierge particularly very very good. I've paid way more for way less around the world. room very comfy and spacious, get a high floor for better views obviously.  really lovely break here. ",5,2019,02,18
226,Average,"Staff very friendly. Overall rooms and experience is very average. No mirror in the bedroom for a girl to do makeup lighting very poor in the bathroom to do makeup having to sit on the toilet to do makeup in a 5 star executive room might i add. No where at all in the shower to put shampoo, conditioner and shower gel, had to put them on the floor. In a 5 star executive room. Very disappointing a 5 star room should be perfect this was very average dont waste your money stay in a travel lodge for the same experience ",3,2019,02,18
226,Short break,"Excellent hotel, all staff friendly and helpful. Good selection of drinks in the bar. Plenty of tea, coffee in the rooms often hotels only give minimum amount. Evening turn down service with delicious chocolates. ",5,2019,02,18
226,First Class Hotel with First Class Service,"Great, first class hotel. Could not fault ! Service level throughout the hotel was superb - really well looked after. Would recommend this hotel to others as a ‚Äòbest in class‚Äô. Location in central Belfast is perfect for sightseeing and shopping.",5,2019,02,18
226,Valentine treat,Fab stay room presentation beautiful. Although room a bit stuffy and couldn't open window to air. Breakfast amazing. Staff friendly and efficient. Hot bath in the morning with plenty of freebies to use. Car parking not so good but hotel was very busy and we booked late.,5,2019,02,18
226,Defo not 5 star.,I booked this nights stay for my boyfriend for Xmas and I chose this hotel because I wanted a relaxing stay in a 5 start hotel. I don‚Äôt make that much money. I saved up for this for ages and it cost me a lot to book the room. I‚Äôve never stayed in a 5 star hotel before and I can say now this was not one.  Before we even got there we were told there was limited parking and we had to pay 18 pounds for overnight parking in some multi storey car park place. When we arrived We were told our room was ready. Went up to room the door was open and there were bed clothes everywhere. Went back down and had to wait another 20 min for new hotel room to be ready. The receptionist said she upgraded us and said she was sorry she had us waiting but we didn‚Äôt upgrade rooms we just went up a floor. The room was lovely. Couldn‚Äôt fault it. But the milk that was given with the tea and coffee was sour. The tv also kept freezing and the signal kept dropping so we gave up on that after a while. Literally froze every 5 minutes. Later in the eve we went for dinner in the restaurant on the first floor. The staff were disinterested in us. We waited ages for food and drinks. They also took ages to take the plates away when we were finished. We ordered a whiskey ginger ale  and a baileys on the rocks. Took maybe 15 minutes to arrive for such a simple order. They arrived and they were in hot glasses like I mean hot. When I reordered he put less drink in them. Air conditioning non exisitant also. Really disappointing will not stay here again. Also for anyone reading this. I have never stayed in a 5 star hotel and I am not the one to complain but this is not what I paid for at all.,2,2019,02,17
226,Great Hotel! Outstanding service!,"I had written a previous negative review of this hotel, but I deleted it and changed it because of the excellent resolution. 

Jara from management found us and promised to rectify the situations I outlined. I don't really expect hotels to actually reach out and try to fix the issues, but Jara did just that and more!
All my concerns were listened to and fixed and I couldn't be happier. This type of service is what separates the great hotels from the good hotels, and this is definitely a great hotel. 

There was an incident on Valentines day on our floor, and Jara explained what had happened and that it was taken care of immediately The offending parties were removed from the hotel, which is good to know they take security seriously.

Its good to know that we are staying in a hotel that listens and actually does what they say they will do. 

I will be back in Belfast soon and this is the hotel I will be choosing again.

A few other things...

Breakfast is wonderful. Don't really understand the complaints from other people. The service is great and the food is great.

Location is perfect. Walking distance to basically everything in the city.",5,2019,02,17
226,Lovely but not 5 star,"We had a lovely stay here but I would not consider it a five star hotel. The room was very comfortable, nicely decorated but quite tight for room (we stayed in an executive king). The USB sockets did not work and some of the fixtures were a bit shabby. In the bathroom, the ceiling above the shower was covered in black mould, around the shower door was ""crusty"" and the tiles in the shower were chipped. This said, the shower worked great and was very powerful.
We ate in the hotel restaurant - nice decor, nice food but our waitress was ""uninterested"" to say the least! We were seated in a booth at the entrance to the dining room where dirty dishes were stacked up behind us. The cutlery had fingerprints all over it. Breakfast was lovely and the waiting staff were too. I know these are only little discrepancies but they should have no place in a good five star hotel. ",4,2019,02,16
226,Beyond every expectation,"Fabulous location , great staff , Beautiful property and an amazing city . Perfect Location for first timers with plenty of sites within walking distance .Personally we attended an event out in the Odyssey and the hotel reception called us a cab and they were prompt and polite. Highly Highly recommend this hotel.  Can't wait to return.",5,2019,02,15
226,Excellent hotel for couples,"Booked for valentines and the room cleanliness and well decorated room was amazing she loved it and that‚Äôs all I could asked for all staff where very good and breakfast in bed and wake up call were made not a minute late , Thank you ",5,2019,02,15
226,Fantastic stay,"Had a great weekend at this great hotel. The room was one of the best we'd ever stayed in, very spacious and with bathroom robes and slippers! The breakfast was superb, both quality and choice. Each member of staff we met were extremely friendly. ",5,2019,02,14
226,Great place to stay in Belfast City Center,"Smaller entrance, but quite a big hotel. Style is old school, but very recently refurbished. Great rooms (executive), big bed, nice bathroom, nice decoration. A place to return to, when in Belfast again. Extra: across the road: the oldest pub of Belfast.

Basic breakfast is ok, with variety of bread, pastry, fruits and yoghurts. some cheese, meat and fish also. warm breakfast is ordered by menu. In my case I was seated by the breakfast restaurant manager, without explanation of the difference between basic and menu. I was also puzzled, because I preordered breakfast at check inn and got discount, for what seemed a full (warm) breakfast (that should be known to the manager in advance you would think). So I started off with basic and by the time somebody else of the staff asked me if I would fancy something from the menu, I declined, because I already had enough of the basic stuff. Big explanation, but in short: seating and communication could be improved. existing deals should be met accordingly. Maybe the manager had a bad morning, that can always be the case. Anyway, I enjoyed the hotel very much on every other account.",4,2019,02,13
226,Excellent for pre-theatre dining ,"We opted for the pre-theatre menu as the selection on it was excellent. The food and service was fantastic. We had the one p√¢t√© starter and one beef starter and both where delicious. The only thing is that there is far too much pate for the amount of bread.
For our mains we had one rump steak and one chicken and I can safely say my rare steak was cooked to perfection. We also had two large glasses of wine. The total cost was a very reasonable ¬£60.50.
If you are attending The Grand Opera House, then I recommend here as is directly next door so no rushing around town after dinner.",5,2019,02,13
226,Meal,Poor service and very expensive for what was provided ¬£135 for 4 people. The staff did not return when asked for condiments and also had to be reminded when asked for drinks. The menu was very limited and when we had finished and left the general feeling was not a good experience,2,2019,02,12
226,Fitzwilliam Belfast,"Lovely hotel and staff, breakfast staff needs bit of a jolt, got the food order wrong 3 times and a wait to order hot food, also why no sweetener in the sugar bowl. Dinner was good the resident dinner option is very good value. Will visit again",4,2019,02,11
226,Caterpiller business trip,"Would not stay anywhere else in Belfast. I have no advice other than keep doing what your doing. I am a long time visitor and guest, so I have experienced the hotel and the service provided since 2013. ",5,2019,02,11
226,A really pleasant surprise,"We booked last minute to stay as we had tickets for 'The Bodyguard' which was on in the Opera House next door. We were a little late of arriving and the pre theatre menu in the restaurant was fully booked so we ordered room service to the room for a bite to eat before going into the show. The food arrived quickly, was warm and was really delicious. The room was well laid out, and most importantly really clean and the shower in the bathroom was warm and powerful. The breakfast was delicious and there was plenty to chose from. We took advantage of the car parking offered by the hotel and so simply drove up to the front door and we were looked after from there. The bar was a lovely place to sit after the show for a few drinks and the cocktails were amazing. Overall a really unexpected treat of a stay for a last minute book and we will definitely be back.",5,2019,02,11
226,Couples night away,"Welcoming hotel with very friendly restaurants receptionist The room was lovely and clean with robes, slippers, umbrella, ironing board and iron The bed was extremely comfortable and the breakfast fantastic The hotel was in a perfect location within easy walking distance to the waterfront, shops, pubs and restaurants.Fantastic location and hotel  I would recommend it for a short break away ",5,2019,02,10
226,Very Disappointing,"went as a treat for my fiance's birthday but was extremely disappointed with aspects of the hotel. Room was clean and tidy, very nice view and lovely turn down service however the food was a massive let down. Unfortunately I cannot eat any wheat, dairy or chilli products which i informed the hotel about a month prior to our stay. When we arrived at the breakfast on our first day the waitress didn't even understand what i was trying to tell her about my dietary requirements. I wasn't even offered any gluten free bread or even soya milk.When my breakfast came out it was missing some of the things i had ordered as well. when my partners arrived it was rubbery and over cooked to the point the sausage was dry. Buffet selection was lovely however only gluten free cornflakes,cookie and scone was available. Dinner that night was even worse as my partners pork was pure fat and mustard. complied as he couldn't even eat it, then turned off his dinner eating a wrap from Tesco down the road.  
Would not go back at all for the money, very let down. Stayed in b&b's that have been more accommodating with needs for less then ¬£90 a night compared to this at over ¬£200. Need to sort food out!",2,2019,02,09
226,Inexperienced unattentive staff,No idea how this is a 5 star hotel ? Missing so so many features expected of a 5 star hotel. Breakfast staff forgetting to take orders then forgetting part of the order (when it was early and not busy). Nice rooms and friendly front of house staff.,3,2019,02,08
226,City centre hotel,"Fabulous hotel, great rooms, friendly staff. Lovely reception. Bar menu disappointing and good only available till 9.40. Room service is an option but menu choice poor. A shame as breakfast really good and everything else spot on",4,2019,02,07
226,First Class Find,"Outstanding hotel, exceptional staff, brilliant room and facilities. A real find and gem. Food was excellent and beautifully prepared and presented. Great for local amenities and easy walking. Bar was well stocked and cocktails a delight. Concierge is  a fount of local knowledge. Can't fault anything.",5,2019,02,07
226,Excellent hotel,"Superb hotel - comfortable and central location.  Staff welcoming and friendly.  Concierge very helpful and attentive.  Newish hotel so a couple of things still need to be 'fixed': toilet flush not strong, so each time we used the toilet we filled the wastepaper bin with water, and then tipped it into the toilet.  Also, a strange electric wiring circuit which meant that the light inside the lobby of the room is controlled by a switch by the bed: in the dark we could never find this so a good idea to bring a small torch.  Key cards needed 'reprogramming' each day.  Otherwise all excellent.",5,2019,02,06
226,Fantastic,Top class truly 5 star.  Location staff breakfast rooms extra touches huge comfy bed.  The staff everyone of them outstanding.  Breakfast one of the best we have ever had in a 5 star hotel.  We will return with out hesitation.,5,2019,02,05
226,Winter Warmer Wonderstay,"Great time at the Fitzwilliam. Front of house staff from check in to check out was great, made to feel very welcome. Rooms were plush and spacious. Bar area was gorgeous, service a bit slow as it wasnt even too busy. Rugby on big screen in the afternoon and as bar was busy a side room was set up for additional viewing. Evening meal, residents menu was adequate, steak was just okay, service was the slowest I have ever expereinced anywhere, one hour between starter and main, staff were great and apologised (to lots of people) but  for a five star hotel this would need to be addressed. The resturaunt was busy but not hectic so not sure what the issue was. Live music with a trio of young ladies singing later in the evening was very entertaing. Breakfast was great with a good selection from buffet, cereals, yogurts, Danishes etc and a very good selection on a menu to order from. Overall a very pleasant experience and would recommend the hotel for a short break, but they do need to pay attention to service times, as wait was just too long. Car parking off site at ¬£25 was dear enough and this could also be addressed for guests, given the price to stay there.",5,2019,02,05
226,Smart place to stay in centre of Belfast,Very smart hotel in the centre of Belfast.  If arriving by car I suggest pre-book the valet parking which is very convenient.  Very friendly and efficient staff.  The rooms are comfortable and well appointed.  Breakfast is excellent with a wide choice of a continental or cooked breakfast the latter of which although not from the buffet but individually ordered was very promptly served after the order was taken.  Good value overall for such a central location.,4,2019,02,05
226,Fantastic,Had a fantastic time at the fitzwilliam. It Was a wee treat away for our wedding anniversary. Room service was brilliant. Breakfast was amazing. Was such a comfortable and relaxing stay. We highly recommend.,5,2019,02,04
226,Fancy but comfortable,"Wonderful time at the Fitzwilliam.  From check in to check out felt very welcome.  Rooms were plush and spacious.  Bar area was gorgeous but very busy as live music.  Got a seat in reception area and was perfect for few drinks and a chat.  Breakfast was amazing.  Great selection from buffet, cereals, yogurts, Danishes etc and great selection on menu for ordering.",5,2019,02,04
226,Very comfortable,"Excellent hotel couldn't fault anything amazing food , very comfortable stay , very friendly staff , parking close by ¬£14 for the sat nite , good entertainment in bar and nice cocktails  on offer  also good location close to many bars and restaurants ",5,2019,02,04
226,Great room and breakfast,"The location of the hotel is absolutely perfect. Across the road you will find a supermarket, Starbucks and restaurants to eat as well as the Irish Tour centre where we had a tour to the causeway. The room was beautiful, large and very comfortable. It was clean, but not completely spotless, especially after the first day, the bathtub was not cleaned. For the breakfast the selection wasn't too big but the food and service was excellent. There was only a slight delay near closing time as it looked very busy .The price is a little expensive, considering they only have a tiny gym and no other facilities. Overall, I enjoyed the stay. Location and room wise, it was near perfect. ",5,2019,02,04
226,Birthday Celebrations at the Fitz,"This hotel is luxurious and relaxing, from arrival to departure.  The little touches of the birthday treat left in the room on arrival, and the turn down service with the chocolates a delight.  Breakfast was pricey but good value as part of our package.  I will be back to stay again.",5,2019,02,04
226,"Great rooms, great service, but overnight refurbishing works","The hotel is in a great location, has great staff, rooms and a fantastic breakfast. I stayed here for 4 nights, and all was well, except one night when my sleep was disturbed by sounds of hammering. When I asked about this I learned that there were some overnight building works (new floor in the kitchen). This is why I only give three stars. I would expect from a 5* hotel to find ways not to disturb guests sleep.",3,2019,02,04
226,Great spot,"Centrally located in the heart of the city
Staff second to none could not have been more helpful great recommendations and directions 
Breakfast excellent
Restaurant food good we did b&b and evening meal ",4,2019,02,03
226,Excellent hotel in the heart of Belfast,Stayed a couple of nights here. Great room and very good value for a luxury hotel. Breakfast was very good. The staff were really wonderful - friendly and helpful without being over the top. We‚Äôll definitely stay here again when we come back to Belfast.,5,2019,02,03
226,Great service!,A great 5* hotel with very good service. Had 2 great nights and a full day meeting at the hotel. All TOP!! Great location with good breakfast and also efficient concierge service. A great place to return to!,5,2019,02,02
226,Great hotel,"Booked a junior suite for a personal trip, the staff were excellent at every point, the room was fantastic, very comfortable stay.

Breakfast was excellent and the valet service ideal.

The hotel is very centrally located, ideal for a couples stay or business trip",5,2019,02,02
226,Brilliant from start to finish,"Me and my husband had an overnight stay wth 4course meal and Breakfast. Room & atmosphere was 1st class and food was delicious,never had a more luxurious breakfast unreal. Staff were so friendly and cheerful in a down to earth approachable way. Can‚Äôt wait to get back.",5,2019,02,01
226,Excellent,Had a very enjoyable stay .. comfortable and relaxed. We received the voucher for a Christmas gift and it was the best gift we received as we also got tickets for a concert in the opera House  for the same night. Really enjoyed our stay from start to finish,5,2019,02,01
226,"Great hotel, would stay here again ","Stayed here for 2 nights in Jan 19. The hotel was clean, with comfortable beds and the breakfast in the restaurant was very good (a continental selection ready to go and an extensive menu of other breakfast choices). Very nice chocolates provided each evening with the turn down service! The check in staff were very friendly and helpful with lots of suggestions of what to do in the city. All in all, a lovely hotel that I wouldn‚Äôt hesitate to book again. ",5,2019,01,31
226,Short winter break,"Just returned from a two night stay in the fitzwilliam hotel in Belfast,
     As soon as we pulled up at the entrance the concierge was out and collected our luggage, we had arrived very early and he said he would look after our luggage and
Place it it our room when it became available,
         Went into city centre and when we returned luggage was in our room.
Room 517 was spacious and comfortable with everything one would expect available
to make our stay a pleasant experience.
      The speed of the internet was fantastic the best I've encountered.
Breakfast on both mornings was really good, 
       My wife and I visit Belfast regularly and have stayed in numerous hotels
But agree that the Fitzwilliam is one of our favourites.",5,2019,01,31
226,Great hotel,"Great hotel, great people and great location. Ground floor public rooms cold and draughty - not what you expect from such a good hotel. Other than this a great place to stay in a welcoming and interesting city",4,2019,01,30
226,Practically perfect in every way!,"Amazing hotel in one of the most wonderful cities. The people of Belfast are utterly charming. 
Jara is one the best members of hospitality staff I have ever met, worldwide. From moving furniture to get you comfortable in the very busy bar to making reservations to even remembering which bags were ours when we returned to collect them at the end of our stay. She truly made our trip unforgettable. 
The service, food and drinks were all equally great.
The rooms are large, clean and comfortable. 
Location is great to explore the city from and the outstanding concierge team only make this even easier.
We will be back. Soon I hope!",5,2019,01,29
226,Average 4 star/3 star,Firstly cannot complain about the location and the staff in general were polite and helpful. The food is very poor in the bar/breakfast and room service food was of terrible quality to the point that we did not eat it. Room in general was clean except the next morning I noticed that the empty toiletries from the previous guest remained in the shower. The bar was advertised in the welcome pack as being open late for residents however unfortunately closed about 10/15 minutes for guests after it had closed for the public. In general would not recommend the hotel,2,2019,01,29
226,Best Bar Staff in the City!,"Every time we visit the Fitzwilliam we leave with a smile on our faces! The bar staff are unbelievably friendly especially Beth who served us on our first visit and has made a point of serving us every time since and remembered our order since the first time which was well over a year ago! The staff go over and above, with nothing being too much hassle! Definitely a must visit when in Belfast for a cocktail or two!",5,2019,01,29
226,The Perfect Place to Relax in the Heart of Belfast,"The staff were really friendly from the moment we arrived until we left and could not do enough for us.Fresh flowers in the lobby were very nicely arranged in attractive luxurious surroundings with its subtle decor, making the lobby a very enticing place to sit for a while. Beds were ever so comfortable. Turn down service including chocolates on the pillow was a pleasant surprise. We look forward to a return visit!",5,2019,01,28
226,Superb city centre hotel,"The Fitzwilliam Hotel is an excellent base for a trip to Belfast, very centrally located, excellent food and cocktails, fabulous decor and the rooms are very spacious. Each guest is made to feel extremely welcome and all staff greet you as you arrive back into the hotel after being out and chat to you at every opportunity.  Everybody is very friendly and helpful and it was a pleasure to stay at the Fitzwilliam.  I haven't been in a few years and the decor has all been upgraded since my last visit but I will definitely be booking the Fit\william for future visits to Belfast.  ",5,2019,01,28
226,Lovely stay.,Just a couple of minor gripes. Sticky wine glass in room.  We were on the second floor and the noise from outside kept me awake most of the night. Will request higher floor next time.  Other than that loved it. ,4,2019,01,28
226,Romantic Getaway ,"Our stay was perfect. Beautiful room and beautiful view. 
Loved the little touches like chocolate on the pillows and music playing when we arrived in the room. 
The lounge downstairs is perfect for a little cocktail at night by the Fire. 
Very clean and super comfy bed. 
Thank you for a wonderful stay, we will sure to be back when we travel back to Ireland x",5,2019,01,26
226,Fabulous Leisure Break,"Hotel with beautiful modern decor, location is ideal for 1st visitors to the city. Staff in all departments were very pleasant who seemed to enjoy their job. Atmosphere in bar and restaurant were perfect, cocktails and food delicious, thank you. ",5,2019,01,26
226,Nathan at Reception - Great customer service!,We recently stayed on a short break with our small baby. Nathan at reception was very helpful and friendly.There were a few minor issues with our room and he had them sorted out prompty and professionally The next morning he remembered us made an effort to speak to the baby. Great service as usual.,4,2019,01,24
226,Pre-theatre dinner,My friends and I ate in the restaurant of this hotel recently prior to seeing a show next door in The Grand Opera House. The meal was really nice and the wine very good. Reasonably priced too. I did not actually stay in the hotel itself but I'm sure the rooms were top class. Great location for sampling the Belfast culture. ,4,2019,01,23
226,We were kept late for the show.,"We were kept late for the show. 
My wife and I bought a 5 star  2 course Pre Theatre  dinner  next door at The Grand Opera House Belfast   Mon 21st Jan. We arrived 5.50 Pm  we were served  our starter at 6.25pm after we had to bring it to the attention of the staff.
We needed to be seated for the show at 7.15 pm . This meant we had to hurry our Delicious 5 star meal  not even time for tea or coffee . We were not alone there we others who got even slower service.  Meal was amazing pity we did not get the time to enjoy it properly",3,2019,01,23
226,Lovely hotel & excellent staff üòÅ,"Excellent hotel having stayed here for one night I wish I had of been able to stay longer , we where greeted the minute we came through the door of the hotel and made to feel very welcome straight away, the lady on reception was very friendly and helpful , lovely good size room and ensuite with views over Belfast , does a turndown service which is a nice touch , bar does lovely cocktails and the bar staff are very friendly and attentive, breakfast is both continental and cooked , continental is buffet style and cooked breakfast is plated which is not overly big ,  I personally prefer a buffet style to be sure you get enough to eat . Overall would highly recommend a stay at this hotel.",5,2019,01,23
226,One night stay,"Unfortunatly I only got the pleasure of staying for one night. On arrival the check in was quick, easy and the member of staff on the desk gave us everything we needed to know about the hotel. We ordered room service for dinner, the food was fantastic and really well priced considering where we were staying. There was also a guest rate dinner package which we didn't use but we will for sure next time, ¬£25 for four courses. The room was really cosy, nice lighting and a bed that i could have slept in for days. Will definitly be staying again ASAP. ",5,2019,01,23
226,Blockbuster Romance.,I went to Belfast to meet a boy I kissed 36 years ago. It's a beautiful city and staying at the Fitzwilliam made it all the more romantic. It's in the heart of the city centre and the perfect setting for reigniting a romance.,5,2019,01,22
226,Newest most fabulous hotel and service in Belfast,"Just one night was all it took to become our firm favorite in Belfast city , great location , beautiful property and amazingly friendly & attentive staff. Larger than average rooms for city standards and decor is breathtaking . The extra touches were beyond expectation which blew us away . Well done to the Management and staff for making this an easy recommendation from us. Can't wait to return for more than one night. ",5,2019,01,21
226,"Central, high quality, not cheap!","Five star hotel in the city centre. High quality, very comfortable. Relaxed atmosphere and very helpful and friendly staff. Rooms are a generous size and well appointed. Only stayed the one night for a short weekend break, felt it was worth spending the extra when it was only the one night, and wasn't disappointed.",5,2019,01,21
226,Best hotel in belfast,"This hotel was amazing from start to finish, friendly staff very welcoming, our room was amazing,  the service was exceptional. The bar was lovely laid out and had waitress service and a live band and a very large flat screen tv which was great for all us snooker fans. ",5,2019,01,21
226,Great experience,"Helpful and friendly staff. Very pleasant, comfortable and clean. Great location - short walk into the city centre and fantastic food. Couldn't fault our stay. The next time I am in Belfast I will not hesitate to book here again.",5,2019,01,20
226,"Great Hotel, Perfect Location","We visited the Fitzwilliam recently for an overnight stay, and have to say it was fantastic.5 star service from the moment we arrived. As soon as we pulled up, the concierge was out to take our bags and car keys and sort out the valet parking. Check-in was quick and efficient, with Jason offering us tips for local bars and things to do in the area.Phil the concierge then promptly delivered our bags to the room.The room was great; clean and well furnished, and a corner location offering lovely views.As it was a Friday, we were also able to take advantage of the 2-for-1 cocktail offer in the bar.The hotel being city centre, it‚Äôs is obviously in the perfect location for anything you want to do in Belfast.We slept well in the comfortable beds, then went down to the breakfast. Full marks again, savoury pancakes and an omelette were ordered, and both were stunning.All in all we had a fantastic stay, and would not be able to find one fault in the hotel. We‚Äôll be recommending Fitzwilliam Belfast to all our friends, and we will most certainly be back.Thanks for the great service!!!",5,2019,01,20
226,A show-stopper for service and comfort,"Without doubt this was the best hotel in 18 we had visited over the past six weeks. We had booked three deluxe rooms and all were beautifully appointed and comfortable. Although in the same category, the size of the rooms differed so it is just pot luck if you get a big one or a smaller one. Like much of the service we have received in the north of Ireland - both Republic and Northern Ireland - service was impeccable. A lot of hotels and guest houses would do well to undertake training here! The price we paid was for room only and parking (¬£20 per night) and breakfast (buffet only) were additional. A big shout-out to Nathan from reception who not only provided outstanding service (he even had my eye-glasses repaired for me) but organised the best tour of our trip with Jim on the ‚ÄòTroubles‚Äô in Belfast. If only you could bottle Nathan and Jim.",5,2019,01,19
226,Beautiful hotel.. Lovely staff... Just need to improve breakfast ,"I love this hotel.. Stayed several times on business. The rooms are beautiful and comfortable, the staff are lovely and welcoming, the bar and reception areas are really lovely and it's all 5star...
It's just the breakfast that isn't up to scratch... Slow and poor. I'm sure this could be easily rectified
Would stay there again and just skip breakfast ",4,2019,01,18
226,Lovely Friendly Hotel,Excellent stay once more in the Fitzwilliam. The staff are so welcoming and the bedrooms are something special very spacious with a touch of a luxury to them plus there is a lot of nice little extras thrown in.,5,2019,01,18
226,Nice hotel,"Smart hotel in good location. Upgraded rooms very nice. Service good, friendly and efficient. Room service limited but good. Breakfast has wide range of fresh food. Recommended - particularly for business. ",4,2019,01,18
226,Above and Behond,"It was a Fabulous hotel to stay in. Stayed two nights and was worth every penny, staff were lovely and couldn't have asked for a better visit to Belfast. I ordered pizza from the room service about 3am, was amazed it was delivered quickly and everyone who i knew that stayed was taken away by the hotel. ",5,2019,01,17
226,Loved Fitzwilliam Belfast,Really a fantastic hotel. Lovely staff and the best concierges I‚Äôve come across. Rooms are comfortable and my room had a full-size Nespresso machine. Need I say more?? The location is great too. Around the corner from three great pubs and next to an air coach drop off and pick up location. Easy walk to Botanical gardens.,5,2019,01,17
226,"Friendly staff, luxurious room with all amenities you could want when away from home.",Staff were happy to assist with directions and advice on the best ways to get about. The room was amazingly appointed and expertly cleaned each day. Absolutely perfect location. Shops and pubs/bars in walking distance.,5,2019,01,16
226,2 nights in a city centre hotel,"We stayed in the Fitzwilliam after our wedding in Belfast.

Lovely hotel in a great location.  We arrived at our hotel late to a room with classical music playing alongside chocolates on our pillows.

It's the little things.

Thank You.  We would love to stay with you again.",5,2019,01,15
226,Not quite 5 star,Stayed for a night away with my husband. Usually stay here about once a year. Stayed on the winter warmer deal. Staff lovely and polite. 3 course dinner and hotel room where nice but not 5 star. Breakfast was fabulous.,4,2019,01,15
226,Weekend Beak,"Amazing hotel with amazing staff. Interior is top class. Special mention to Jason and Chloe on reception who were so lovely and to the bar man, the cocktails were insane! great location as well 100% returning :) ",5,2019,01,15
226,overnight stay,"really lovely hotel, definitely return and recommend to others. from the initial welcome by the excellent concierge service, to the reception staff and the cleaning staff just as we arrived in our room....couldn't have asked for more.",5,2019,01,15
226,Great Location,"The hotel itself and the rooms are beautiful, the staff is friendly and accommodating & the location is ideal. We were within walking distance of many popular restaurants and bars and the taxi ride from the airport is only 15 minutes at max. I would definitely stay here again. ",5,2019,01,14
226,Outstanding hotel in a perfect location.,"Very happy with our stay over the weekend, on arrival we where greated by Stephan who had brought our vehicle to be parked, once checked in which was very easy,quick and hassle free. 
Food was hot and great customer service over the weekend, very happy with the hotel facility's and accomadating. Highly recommended booking this hotel for a lovely stay in Belfast, rooms clean and spacious with the latest interior designs. 
Thanks again to all the staff at Fitzwilliam hotel.",5,2019,01,13
226,Really good,"Spent two nights here and can‚Äôt really fault much and these faults would probably be personal things anyway (wish they would ask if you want a ‚Äòturn-down‚Äô service as we really don‚Äôt like it and the tea/coffee facilities in the room are tucked away in a small cupboard next to the bed that is really hard to use, especially when you‚Äôre half-awake and trying to be quiet as your partner‚Äôs still asleep!) 
Apart from that the hotel itself is well appointed/decorated, the service is excellent and the food and drink offerings are pretty good too. 
A very handy location and we will definitely be back. ",5,2019,01,13
226,Decent,"Good rooms, a little tired around the edges, but one of better ones in Belfast, Great breakfast and restaurant. Would definitely stay again if in Belfast. Location is fine though nowhere particularly interesting to walk nearby",4,2019,01,12
226,How do you fail with just dessert?,"So we made an impulsive stop here (as we do like an expensive hotel ...) for after dinner drinks. Upon looking at the dessert menu, we chose a type of deconstructed strawberry shortcake and ordered it along with some (expensive) drinks. Our young male server (tattooed arms) was very nice and friendly (but maybe has a hearing/listening issue)? Drinks came and we waited with bated breath for a dessert that would never come. 

We decided to say nothing and just wait. No dessert ever came. 

Servers were very sweet but there was a Twilight-Zone feeling about the place. Never mind that they serve thimble-sized whiskey servings (had a 10 yr whiskey) and charge an arm and a leg. Really people?? Laughable!

Bar area could use a bit of updating although I(we) loved the retro look about the bar (e.g. the carpet).

Both men's and ladies' rooms were FILTHY. Clean it up, people. Disgusting for the caliber of hotel. And the place was dead - not busy at all so this place should have been SPOTLESS. 

We had considered booking this hotel for our stay and we were SO glad we did not.",1,2019,01,12
226,5 star from start to finish *****,If you haven't been here before just do it. You will not regret it. I for one will be booking again!! The cocktails were fab! The food was so yummy! And the service was absolutely perfect. The beautiful room was complimented with an amazing city view. And that's before we even talk about the service. Was made to feel so special and nothing was too much bother. So impressed!!,5,2019,01,11
226,Lovely hotel in an excellent location,"My husband and I had a great experience at The Fitzwilliam Hotel. The room was lovely and very clean. Also, the staff was very kind and helpful. The hotel is in an excellent location with a lot of shopping and restaurants located within walking distance.",5,2019,01,11
226,"Lovely hotel, Great location","We've just had a three night stay in Belfast at the Fitzwilliam Hotel and we thoroughly enjoyed our stay.  The rooms are large and clean and beautifully decorated.  The bathrooms again are large and extremely clean.Breakfast at the Fitzwilliam was fab, good start for a day exploring Belfast.  The staff are all really pleasant and helpful.Recommend both the titanic experience and the day trip to the Giants Causeway (both booked through Viator).",5,2019,01,10
226,Christmas stay,My husband and I had our Christmas dinner here and a stay on Christmas night. We booked the junior suite and and it was beautiful. Our problem was the dinner. It cost ¬£105 for 5 courses so are expectations were high. When we arrived we ordered a bottle of prosecco. They seemed to forget about it and we had to ask again. The first 2 courses were delicious. For the mains my husband ordered the 10oz rib eye and I ordered the halibut with tempura mussels. When they arrived mine was missing the mussels and my husband got the wrong meal. When he received it he thought 'that doesn't look like 10oz' but he began to eat it anyway. It turns out he got venison (which was nice but he was disappointed it was not what he ordered). The desserts were ok. The 5th course was tea and coffee with mince pies. We didn't get the mince pies. Overall our stay was lovely but for ¬£105 each we expected much better for the dinner. We had a much better meal in Jospers in Ten Square not 3 days later.,3,2019,01,09
226,Amazing experience,I spent 4 days There with my wife and We enjoyed every single minute at this hotel.The service was excellent.The room was perfect and clean.the h√¥tel is well located and affordable.Thank you for all.,5,2019,01,09

226,Nowhere near a 5 Star experience,"Arrived to the hotel to begin our honeymoon and would never stay here again! 

- Room extremely small & very dark
- Wardrobe was dusty & dirty looking
- Paint was chipped on walls and doors
- Tissue boxes were dusty & dirty on the side lockers
- Bottle opener was flimsy & didn't work too well
- Radio in closet - looked cheap and shelf was scratched
- Tiling on the side of the bath tub was hanging off
- Toilet roll holder was loose and hanging down
- Towel hooks were hanging out of the bathroom door and chipped wood all around it
- Handle in shower was loose and hanging out of the wall
- The tealight candle on the edge of the bath had not been replaced and also had a burnt match left beside it
- King size bed looked empty as it only had 4 plain white pillows on it
- Side lockers wood legs were chipped
- French press barely made a cup of coffee - unacceptable for two people
- Design of the glass mirror and behind the bed made the room look dirty
- TV & table stand looked cheap and had cables hanging everywhere
- Staff sent a tiny chocolate brownie up to the room to congratulate us on our honeymoon - only provided one knife, no forks and the brownie was gone in one bite. 

Overall, we were very disappointed with our experience and would absolutely not stay here again, nor would we recommend staying here! Did not once feel like a 5 Star experience.",1,2019,01,08
226,Really fab stay,"Great location walking distance to bars and shops. Beautiful rooms and reception area. Lovely staff. Amazing breakfast tasty omelette made to Order and there was Carrott cake on continental breakfast selection along with much much more I just thought t that was lovely treat.

Would definitely stay again",5,2019,01,08
226,Wow,"This hotel is so beautiful. The staff can‚Äôt do enough for you, the breakfast was lovely plenty to choose from. Your beds get turned down at night with extra touches such as chocolates on your pillows, dressing gown and slippers left. The room was spotless and clean as is the whole of the hotel.I can‚Äôt recommend this hotel enough and will definitely be going back and telling friends and family about it.",5,2019,01,08
226,Best hotel I‚Äôve been to,"The Fitzwilliam is by far the best hotel I have been to. I would highly reccomend it to anyone. Every part of my stay was amazing from the room to the staff. The room had an amazing view and was immaculate. With everything you possible need provided. The staff were so friendly and made us feel right at home, but also as if we were like royalty! No matter what the occasion or what age you are I would highly recommend this hotel to anyone. The food rooms services and staff are second to none in every way!! Thank you for such an amazing stay.",5,2019,01,07
226,Excellent quaint little hotel in Belfast,Nice quaint little hotel in a great location. The room was tastefully furnished and very comfortable. Staff very very friendly and helpful. Ordered room service dinner and food was fast and excellent....I‚Äôm always in a hurry so they were very quick. Highly recommend this hotel for a visit to Belfast. They have a small fitness center but also give you access to an excellent fully equipped gym just down the street with tons of equipment even for those crazy CrossFitters (I‚Äôm not one!)...,5,2019,01,07
226,Top class hotel,This hotel is deffiently worth staying in. The staff are all friendly and very helpful. Everything in the hotel was top class and couldnt fault any of it. We have stayed here before and i can say we will be staying again. ,5,2019,01,07
226,"Fantastic hotel, would highly recommend","My husband and I spent one night at the hotel after flying in from London and before heading to a friends wedding the following day. The room was stylish and had everything you could possibly need, including fantastic shower and top brand hairdryer and coffee maker.  We ordered room service and it was very fast and incredibly delicious. The view from the room was amazing. The bed was ginormous and very comfortable and all the staff were incredibly courteous. They really know how to run a hotel, I would definitely stay there again.",5,2019,01,06
226,Fitzwilliam Hotel in Belfast,"It's a great place in the center of Belfast, close to the Opera House. Everything was fine, great staff, great large and clean room. Patrick is a star at the bar, great cocktails! I'll surely go there again!",5,2019,01,06
226,"Great location, lovely room with nice features","We stayed here for 3 nights. The room was lovely with some nice features, such as a heated mirror (although it would have suited a taller person). I appreciated the small details, such as the radio playing when we arrived, and the tea selection.
We stayed on the 4th floor, and I'm not a fan of lifts. We took the stairs, and found the door to enter our floor was locked. And it was also locked the floor below, meaning we had to take the lift.
I was a bit disappointed with the food. We ordered room service, which arrived promptly, but the quality wasn't great, which I was surprised about. It was a bit bland and undercooked I found.
Also, the cleaning service arrived quite early, at about 10am, and we were still asleep! 
I did like the nightly chocolates though, and the staff were friendly.",4,2019,01,06
226,Lovely winter weekend in Belfast,"My husband and I spent a long weekend at the Fitzwilliam. The hotel is quiet and comfortable and the staff is friendly and professional. We were very happy with the location, easy to walk to shops, restaurants and attractions. ",5,2019,01,06
226,Overnight post Christmas  break.,"Everything was perfect from the time of our arrival.We were greeted in a friendly,courteous manner and were given a room with a city view as requested when booking.When going out to dinner,we asked reception to order us a taxi,which they promptly did.The turndown service ,including chocolates is a nice touch.We stayed in a King superior room which we would highly reccommend.Fantasyic Nespresso machine,biscuits,bottled water and the candle and matches in the bathroom was a lovely touch.We had lunch in the bar and the food was excellent. The hotel decor is very luxurious.(The hotel parking fee was ¬£25 which is expensive when converted to euros.)We are planning our return visit and look forward to it.Thank you to everyone at the Fitzwilliam..We will definitely return.",5,2019,01,05
226,Not 5* standard,Hotel is fine but not near five star in our opinion. Breakfast was not as good as 3*s I've stayed in. Room was ok but nothing special. Door to bathroom did not clothes properly. Don't get me wrong we had a good stay but it definitely was not 5*,2,2019,01,03
226,New Year's Eve stay with family. Running late for panto next door but the quick and efficient check in staff got us all,Running late for Panto next door. Reception staff got us checked in quickly and efficiently.  Concierge were excellent and well organised. My vehicle was unloaded and parked before I finished checking in! Rooms bit small for family of 4 (1 teenager ) . Proper second bed would be great . Would consider Fitzwilliam as a family stay in Belfadt  if larger rooms.,5,2019,01,03
226,Fab and modern hotel,Fab rooms and excellent hotel staffRestaurant totally let this hotel down with waiting 2 hours for dinner and other customers that came after us were served first. No apologies by management and the poor waitress/waiters received awful comments by other customers but management still never came,3,2019,01,03
226,New Year Stayover,"Good location, easy for shops/theatre. Room comfortable (not 5*) but comfortable enough. Restaurant food average....sorry, below average! for a so called 5* hotel, breakfast was dry and certainly not worth the ¬£20 or ¬£1350 discounted rate (better and cheaper breakfasts near by at a fraction of this) staff in restaurant disinterested and indifferent when you politely ask for something, music too loud (more for the benefit of the staff I suspect.....thump, thump music not what one wants at breakfast!) very dissapointed on what could have been a really nice stay. better & cheaper hotels available near by.",3,2019,01,03
226,A super experience,"We had an amazing time from arrival to departure, Nathan from front of house was a wealth of information and so helpful, Niamh who was working in the bar on New Years Eve was amazing her service,friendliness and professionalism was top class ""Thank you Niamh"",All in we had an amazing experience in this hotel the service and attention to detail was 10/10 its location is spot on for those who don't know Belfast.. we will definitely be recommending the Fitzwilliam and are looking forward to returning in the Summer",5,2019,01,03
226,Nice Hotel need to sort out staffing level in restaurant,"We stayed in Fitzwilliam hotel on 1st of Jan check in was no probs staff efficient and friendly. We parked in car park across road ¬£16 for night with ticket validated in hotel. We went for a dander around town which the hotel is really handy for town centre üòÉ My wife and I had a lovely meal in the hotel restaurant our room was very clean and had everything you would expect in a 5* hotel. Breakfast which is not cheap the next morning was a severe disappointment it seemed that the restaurant was severely under staffed we arrived at 09:15 and were shown to a table, we had some coffee and orange juice from the continental buffet and at 09:20 ordered a full cooked Fitzwilliam breakfast from the waiter, at 10:05 hours I had to seek out the same waiter and ask what the hold up was as people who had come in long after us had already been served there hot breakfast, he asked again what our order was and it eventually came at 10:25 making some excuse that the order was lost in Kitchen, Very few of the tables were cleared away when customers left this all seems to have been a staffing numbers problem, not what I would expect from a 5 star hotel with 5* prices  as there are lots of other hotels to choose from in Belfast now. Big let down Fitzwilliam Hotel have stayed here before would seriously think about ever staying here again üò¢",2,2019,01,02
226,Five stars and Beyond,More than a five star ‚≠êÔ∏è service from the staff ... location was great. Recommend this hotel to stay while in Belfast . Thank you for making our trip very special. Everyone in the Fitzwilliam Team were amazing üòâ ,5,2019,01,02

226,Service The Winner,"Just had another amazing stay at the stunning Fitzwilliam Hotel in Belfast to celebrate New Year with my wife. 

Hotel itself has more competition in the Belfast area now but these are very much pretenders to the throne when it comes to comfort and overall excellent genuine warm friendly service, not to mention value for money.

At reception we were greeted by the very friendly Nathan, have stayed at this hotel a few times and recognised Nathan as he is always so friendly and genuinely friendly, making light hearted conversation as opposed to some hotels where this can feel so scripted and almost robotic. He was excellent!

We opted for the New Year residential package which included a beautiful 4 course meal in the restaurant where we were served by the really friendly Tao & James. I had the Risotto and then Venison Wellington which was perfectly cooked, and even if it wasn‚Äôt the attention and service from the staff would have made it easy to request any changes but thankfully the food absolutely delivered. 

We both then went to the bar where we were greeted by the excellent James who I believe is the Beverage Manager, and the amazing service continued. He was attentive, friendly, made sure every table was being seen by the excellent waitress(sorry I missed her name) but it was just a brilliant night made complete by the service.

If you want to see Belfast for all that is great about the city then the Fitzwilliam is a must stay location.

Loved it, and of course we will be back!

",5,2019,01,01
226,What a great hotel,"The rooms are very spacious and the beds are super comfy, 
position of the hotel is next to the town but very quiet,

226,Christmas ,"Went to Belfast for Christmas to see our niece and her partner.
We picked the Fitzwilliam for a treat and were blown away how good it was. Our room 513 was massive with big bed that was so so comfy and a big sofa. Bathroom was big with a bath & a walk in shower.
Christmas Day a nice touch was a stocking hung up on the door with presents in loved everything well done.
Breakfast was excellent quality food and you could pick extra sausages instead of black/white pudding etc. Sausages were the best from any hotel I‚Äôve stayed in.
The waiting staff were friendly and very efficient. The staff on reception were very helpful and friendly but the concierges couldn‚Äôt do enough for you from carrying suitcases to ringing a taxi. Phillip was very easy and friendly to chat to giving info for what we needed.
Next year I think we will be back it was so good.",5,2018,12,30
226,Go and have a wonderful Christmas,"Last year we decided to go back to Belfast for Christmas. We‚Äôd never been away for Christmas before  but we just loved Belfast, the people were so friendly and so much to do and places to visit. Looked on trip advisor for recommendations and the Fitzwilliam 
hotel had very good reports ,so took the plunge in September and booked for 4 days . Well we were not disappointed. From the minute we arrived  we knew we‚Äôd made the right choice. The food , the staff, the room were fantastic. On Christmas Day, lunch was fantastic and in the evening you could choose from a very wide range of meals , we couldn‚Äôt manage much so just had a sharing meat and cheese platter. So all in all our Christmas was terrific. If you want to treat yourself then the Fitzwilliam is certainly the place to stay.",5,2018,12,29
226,Best hotel by far !!,"Excellent hotel !!! First time staying here and will definitely be back .

226,Christmas 2018,Stayed last Christmas. Fabulous time hence the desire to come back this year. Great staff in all departments. Faultless.  My wifes birthday.we received a bottle of prosecco and a lovely card to celebrate compliments of the hotel. So much appreciated. Hope to go back next Christmas if not before. ,5,2018,12,27
226,Understaffed,"I am  reluctant to write a poor review as i try to see the best in every situation. On this trip i joined some friends visiting NI. The room was nice and reception was friendly on arrival. However there seemed to be a lack of staff in the dining room. The gentleman at the next table told me he was on business and when he came at 7am, the buffet wasnt open. He was told they were short staffed. When we arrived i ordered a full fitzwilliam breakfast and after waiting ages i had to remind the waitress. I then spoke to Patrick who seemed to have some authority. He wasnt much help. The waitress then brought me sweet pancakes!!! It was a complete disaster. The only helpful person with any interest in good customer service was a young waiter called Sebastian who was serving on the second morning. He was obviously experienced and kindly got us everything we asked for. He even gave us some sightseeing tips. He was the only decent one there. The others were frankly nasty and rude.",1,2018,12,26
226,Lovely relaxing stay - worth paying for,"Booked at short notice via the hotel website we stayed on Christmas Eve.  Lovely ambiance in the hotel and decoration.  Luxurious rooms and great service from staff in reception, restaurant, bar and housekeeping.  Highly recommended.",5,2018,12,26

226,Ok hotel,"I have stayed here many times over the years. It is very close to theater district and good bars in the area. Bedroom was heated and a modern feel to the hotel. The hotel can be a bit expensive. Food was good. I just think there is better hotel,s fir a better price.",3,2018,12,23
226,The best hotel experience !,"The staff here were really efficient and friendly, check in and check was quick, they also provide boarding pass printing service. The breakfast starts from 7am-11am, it was delicious and scrumptious! We really had a good night on their comfy super king size bed. They were also shower and bathtub in the toilet. Moreover, what makes the experience even better was their speakers in the room! The sound quality was just excellent! I would definitely come back again ! ",5,2018,12,23
226,LOVELY STAY,Hotel is very central and convenient to everything in the city centre.  Bedroom was very clean and comfortable.  Food for dinner and breakfast was delicious.  Only complaint is that corridors are a bit dark and gloomy and there was insufficient toiletries in bathroom for two people.  Otherwise we had a lovely stay and will be back again.  ,5,2018,12,22
226,An Xmas break,"We spent a night in this hotel for a short Xmas break, every about it from when we walked in until we left was top class. The staff were very professional and friendly and the breakfast was beautiful the next morning. Would highly recommend ",5,2018,12,22
226,Very classy hotel with good service.,"stayed for 5 days at this property. My 1st experience was not a good one. The rooms let in too much noise from the street. At a hotel of this quality this is simply unacceptable. Fortunately the street quiets down at night and we were able to sleep without an issue.

Other than that the stay was outstanding:
1. The staff across the hotel was very polite and helpful.
2. The food at the Restaurant was very nice.
3. The breakfast was of good quality though did get boring for a long stay for a vegetarian. but then there are many outstanding eating places a short walk from the Hotel.
4. The room is spacious and well appointed and the beds and pillows are very comfortable.
5. The onsite Bar and the special POP up Bar are both very nice.

the hotel is in the city centre close to most things",4,2018,12,19
226,Great location,The location of this hotel was very convenient and the staff were great! The room was well appointed but the bed was a lot firmer than I like leaving me pretty uncomfortable at night. The breakfast however was delicious!,4,2018,12,18

226,50th Birthday Package - fabulous day out,"Visited the hotel for my aunts 50th birthday and can't say enough good things

We had festive afternoon tea which included mulled wine and lots of sweet treats

226,"Super stay! Fabulous, friendly!","Enjoyed a super stay at a friendly hotel in the city centre. Close to shops, markets, theatre, restaurants. Luxury at an affordable rate. Warm fire and cosy lounge, modern bar and friendly staff. Enjoyed the peeling of the church bells too! ",5,2018,12,16
226,Very disappointing festive afternoon tea!,"Visited here recently with my mum for a surprise festive afternoon tea as an early Christmas treat for her. We love trying different afternoon teas, so I was particularly excited to try out this new 5* hotel. I initially enquired about my booking using the online option available on the website and I waited for a reply...and waited..a week later,having heard nothing, I rang them and booked direct over the phone, they did apologise for the lack of response- in hindsight this was the first warning bell! 

The offer online states it‚Äôs ¬£50 per couple and includes a glass of mulled wine. I stated on booking that we would have a non alcoholic version if possible and was assured this would be fine. On arrival we were directed to the first floor restaurant where we met an unmanned desk. After a few minutes wait we were greeted by a friendly gentleman who led us to our seats. A tea and coffee order was taken immediately (no choice of tea?) and served quickly. Unfortunately when the afternoon tea arrived twenty minutes later the hot tea was now luke warm. I asked for a fresh pot of hot tea and was offered some new cups with it too which I accepted...I‚Äôm still waiting for either to arrive!! I eventually had to hunt down someone else to ask again but by this time we had most of the afternoon tea ate...without any tea ironically! There was no check back done until we had finished! 

At this stage I questioned the difference in the menu online and the menu on the table (see photo). The menu on the table said ¬£55 per couple and there was no mention of mulled wine. I reiterated that I had asked on booking for a non alcoholic version. I was told that the tea is ¬£21pp with the option of adding on mulled wine or an alternative for ¬£6.50! He had noted we did not want the mulled wine on booking... yet didn‚Äôt note my request for a non alcoholic version? Or in fact they could just offer a drink at some point throughout service? And what about the online ¬£50 per couple offer?! Make your mind up which offer you‚Äôre running with! 

To top it off the food wasn‚Äôt great. The starters consisted of a turkey sausage roll and ham hock terrine (both tasty- probably the best part of the whole meal) and an espresso cup of soup (far too salty!). The sandwiches included ham and cheese, egg and onion (completely bland- perhaps some of the salt in the soup could have been added here!), salmon on wheaten bread and a chicken wrap that tasted stale and also very bland! The scone (which is normally my favourite part of afternoon tea) was way too overdone, I could have threw it at a wall and it wouldn‚Äôt have crumbled! The egg nog pannacotta was unpleasant in texture and consistency but the rest of the pastries were reasonably tasty in fairness. 

I understand it‚Äôs a busy December weekend but having worked in a 4* hotel myself for seven years I know only too well that this is not a justification for poor and sloppy service!! You call yourself a 5* hotel I expect 5* service. The service needs improved, the food itself needs improved and there needs to be some sort of standardisation between costs and offers! I left hungry having paid ¬£42 for the pleasure. I was very disappointed and to be honest, very embarrassed that I‚Äôd chose this hotel to surprise my mum with an afternoon treat and it was so poor. 

The settings are beautiful and I still want to stay here at some stage to try out the rooms and other services but I‚Äôll not be having afternoon tea again or recommending it to anyone unfortunately. ",2,2018,12,15
226,5 star stay ,"Stayed at the fitzwilliam for two nights recently. From the front desk staff to the concierge, everyone was friendly and extremely helpful. Our room was clean and spacious. I particularly liked having turndown service and the chocolates left on our pillows. The concierge organized a black cab tour for us with a guy named Jim who was a wonderful tour guide and I‚Äôd highly recommend this type of tour for anyone visiting Belfast. ",5,2018,12,15
226,Great facilities but poor breakfast,"Overnight stay in Belfast while visiting Christmas markets. Great accommodation at the Fitzwilliam where the rooms were spacious, comfortable and quiet but a cold ‚ÄúFry‚Äù x 2  on the Saturday morning took the gloss of what was a lovely stay",3,2018,12,15
226,One of the best hotels  would highly recommend it.,Would highly recommend it.  Facilities were fantastic and the staff lovely and welcoming. Rooms have a wonderful luxurious feel and bathroom size is excellent. Only gripe is the noise of traffic when trying to sleep.,5,2018,12,15
226,Concert,"My husband and I stayed here for one night as we were attending a concert in Belfast. The staff in the hotel are absolutely fantastic and I cannot fault them. The room was lovely and quite large with a gorgeous bathroom. We had a bar snack in the bar area and it was good. The bar area is small and when we went to have a pre concert drink we were told there no seats left in the bar and we would have to sit in the lobby - as a hotel resident I felt there should perhaps be a separate area for hotel guests. 
It wasn't until a week later after my husband had checked his credit card bill that he noticed that the hotel were still ""holding"" ¬£250 as insurance for the room. A quick phone call to the hotel sorted this out but it shouldn't have happened in the first place.",4,2018,12,14
226,Five star treat,"My wife and I where going to the theater which is next door the hotel for our anniversary.so we decided to treat ourselves to a stay at the hotel.we booked into hotel car park,¬£25,we stopped outside door,and I could see about four staff ready to welcome us.we handed over car keys then another staff member took us to reception.quick and easy check in.hotel was spotless just oozing five star.room was beautiful really great size.bottles of water supplied,all types of coffee and tea,a stereo,coffee machine ,slippers,robes,filled Mimi bar,large tv,old style phone.we had a superb dinner,service top notch.after show .we when into bedroom and sheets were turned down,a chocolate on pillow with little message.breakfast again superb.what a five star treat",5,2018,12,13
226,From Dublin to Belfast.,I was greeted at the desk by a lovely gentleman called Simon who was very friendly and is an absolute credit to your Hotel. Absolutely gorgeous room and the comfiest bed I've ever slept in. The hotel is in a great location and in walking distance to Queens University and other attractions. Fabulous reception area too.,5,2018,12,12
226,From Waterford to Belfast,Fantastic location within walking distance of most of Belfasts beautiful attractions whilst all the time returning to a very warm and welcoming atmosphere in a quality property we would recommend this hotel to all our friends and are looking forward to returning ,5,2018,12,12
226,Excellent hotel,The Fitzwilliam is very convenient for the city centre. The staff are very helpful and friendly. The food is really good and the rooms are very comfortable. It is an excellent hotel. Would highly recommend it.,5,2018,12,12
226,Stylish & Comfortable,"Friendly staff who don't come across fake nice. Everyome happily engaged and nothing was ever a chore.Rooms are more then well equipped and wanted for nothing.Cooled breakfast wasn't the best I've ever had, but that's just me being picky.",5,2018,12,11
226,Average at best,"Myself & a friend stayed here last week for a 2 night shopping break. The dates were booked preiously for earlier in the hear and were kindly changed. There was a mix up re money due for change of date that i thought had been taken out when booking was modified but it had been my fault.
Unfortunately if I'm honest we did not find our stay to be a 5 star experience. 
The friendliness was lacking - we were not even acknowledged by most staff.
The hotel lacked atmosphere. We had stayed in the Europa the previous year for alot less and there is no comparison.
The food selection & quality of brealfast was not 5 star, although my favourite thing was the mini chocolate muffin.
The rooms were nice but nothing wow. We had an interconnecting room and to say we could hear clearly every word that was said next door on their return was more than embarrassing. 
On the plus the location is good but honestly I didn't feel it was worth the extra spend considering the welcome, atmosphere, quality & selection of food was superior in the 4 star Europa. ",3,2018,12,11
226,Loud music and partying,Loud music next door to our room all night was the only problem we had there seemed to be a party going on all night. As we went away for a weekend for our  wedding anniversary it was disappointing that something like this could happen,5,2018,12,11
226,The Beat hotel in Belfast,"Stayed at the Fitzwilliam on the 9th of December in one of the luxury corner rooms and it was amazing. I proposed to my girlfriend and the staff did everything they could to make it unbelievable and a surprise to my Girlfriend. The 7th floor corner room offers amazing views of the city and has the most gorgeous decor. When I asked if staff could help out with my proposal, they put the ring in the safe and reserved seats beside the fire and had a concierge help me surprise her. This is with out doubt our favorite hotel in Ireland and I cannot thank them enough for their help.",5,2018,12,11
226,"Luxurious Hotel, very centrally located","We've stayed at The Fitzwilliam a few times before, and it's very luxurious, with great d√©cor and settings, also staff very courteous.  The hotel is very centrally located to many great bars and restaurants.  Will definitely stay here again.",5,2018,12,11
226,Christmas,"One of the best hotel in city. Fitzwilliam never disappointed us. Staff, comfort and view from the room makes us keep coming back.As gin lover with the opening of a new gin bar, added delight to our three night stay.",5,2018,12,11
226,Highly recommend,"Easy transfer from airport via shuttle bus straight to Bus station around the corner from hotel.Fantastic welcome from hotel staff,  was able to be checked in very early which was a lovely surprise.Room perfect, bed huge and very comfy, plenty of tea coffee and biscuits etc, replenished toiletries twice a day if needed. Fluffy towels and bathrobes and extremely quiet. Didn't hear a thing at night.Breakfast was amazing! everything you can think of and fantastic quality, you won't need lunch!We didn't have very hot water on the first the evening, however on calling reception the concierge was immediately on hand and the on call maintenance service was brought in and problem sorted within the hour.  Weather wasn't great but large umbrellas were handed to us on our way out and attentive staff are always on hand to arrange taxi and advice. The Hotel is in a perfect location, few steps to shops, great pubs and restaurants, 10 mins walk to the Cathedral quarter and 25 mins easy walk to SSE.Cant recommend this hotel highly enough.",5,2018,12,10
226,Great hotel,"Great hotel for a short weekend trip. Close to many shops, bars and restaurants. Room was quiet. Well appointed room. Great bathroom and complimentary toiletries. Lovely breakfast with a great choice and hot breakfast made to order. We enjoyed some of the lovely cocktails from the bar.",5,2018,12,10
226,Top Class!,"Really enjoyed our stay. Hotel is very central and easy to access by car as we did. Parking is limited so we prebooked parking with the hotel. Pricey at ¬£25 per night, but it was valet parking and when we needed anything from the car it was retrieved for us! If you know Belfast better I am sure there are cheaper alternatives. 

Prior to our stay the concierge were outstanding in helping us plan our trip and book activities and restaurants. So helpful - special mention for Philip that regard. 

Check-In was seamless and very helpful with Chloe. Nigel assisted us with our car and bags etc and continued to help us throughout the stay with information and tips! 

Room was really beautiful and spacious. We booked an executive double. Again concierge brought us to the room and demonstrated all of the facilities. Well appointed room and extremely comfortable bed. It was my birthday and the hotel brought up a little birthday cake which was much appreciated. 

Breakfast was delicious with great choice. 

The hotel is gorgeous, but it is really the staff that stand out and go that extra mile all the time. All of the staff I mentioned were wonderful plus Brian and Jan front of house. They take the time to really welcome guests and make you feel nothing is too much trouble (without being too obtrusive). 

Belfast as a city is so welcoming and friendly. We visited Titantic and did the black taxi tour- I‚Äôd highly recommend both. Christmas market was also wonderful. 

We had a wonderful stay and will definitely return. Thank you Team Fitzwilliam for your fantastic customer care - we loved it! ",5,2018,12,09
226,Absolutely loved this hotel!,"This hotel is perfect. The staff are incredibly attentive and can't do enough to help you. The decor is fabulous in all areas of the hotel. The rooms are really nice with a large bath and large separate shower in the en-suite. The attention to detail cannot be faulted, there was a scented candle and matches on the side of the bath and a turn down service with chocolates on the pillow to make you feel extra special. Nothing is too much trouble for the staff who just want to make sure you have the best stay possible. The breakfast was cooked to order and like everything else was lovely. I would highly recommend this hotel.",5,2018,12,08
226,Second visit,An absolute pleasure as usual will be using this hotel and none other on our next visit....................parking is so easy and handy straight onto the M1 and away! ............staff really friendly can‚Äôt do enough for you,5,2018,12,08
226,Theatre visit,Stayed here for one night with my wife and was very content with the hotel.Excellent location for theatre and city centre shopping. Well appointed comfortable rooms with usual facilities of a very high standard. Well cooked breakfast. Only minor concerns some traffic noise but not enough to disturb sleep and the bar lacking in atmosphere and customers. Staff very friendly and efficient. ,4,2018,12,07

226,A corner of luxury,Always enjoy our trip to belfast and comfort of hotel. Nice staff and helpful. Food always refreshing. Lobby a delight and cosy. Rooms need a bit of uplift now and maybe brighter bathrooms but doesnt impact greatly .,5,2018,12,04

226,"Great hotel, friendly staff","We stayed here for two nights to enjoy a weekend in Belfast. The hotel is really well located, right in the city centre. The staff are very friendly, the rooms are everything you would expect. Lovely big beds and delicious chocolates left at turn-down. It was on the expensive side we thought but is everything you need for a very comfortable city hotel.",4,2018,12,03
226,Lovely conveniently located hotel,"I visited the Fitzwilliam Hotel last month when visiting Belfast for a couple of days. The hotel is beautiful, our room was a great size and the hotel itself is very conveniently located in the city centre. The room was equipped with a hairdryer, bathrobes, loccitane toiletries, tea and coffee making facilities and some very handy guides for visiting Belfast. 

There are lots of bars and restaurants in close proximity.

I will definitely return to this hotel when I next visit Belfast.",5,2018,12,02
226,Best thing about Belfast,"Fantastic staff in this hotel, all very pleasant and efficient. Rooms are clean and comfortable and no noise from hallway, just some traffic noise in the mornings. Cocktails are divine especially the two for one offer on Friday evenings. Breakfast is very tasty, good selection. I‚Äôd recommend porridge with apple and double cream, scrumptious. The staff are fantastic and really make your stay enjoyable. Well done to them all.",5,2018,12,02
226,Excellent service,"Best hotel in Belfast,stayed in many different one but the fitzwilliam offers luxury at affordable prices,staff couldn't be friendlier or more helpful,will definitely look forward to returning in the near future",5,2018,12,01
226,I nice hotel with very friendly staff,I stayed in a City view room. Everything in the room was fine and I slept well. The temperature controls worked which is always a plus. the staff at the hotel are very attentive and friendly. My only complaint is that the chicken I ordered for dinner was undercooked but otherwise the food was good.,4,2018,11,30
226,Top stay in a beautiful hotel,"This is a real joy of a hotel. Staff exceptional. Great d√©cor. Fabulous comfy bed. Nothing too much trouble.

226,Belfast Business trip,Absolutely fantastic stay at a great city centre hotel. Very friendly staff who cannot do enough for you. Walking distance to all the bars and restaurants makes the Fitzwilliam arguably one of the best Belfast Hotels.The valet parking is magnificent.,5,2018,11,29

We arrived early and our rooms were already waiting for us
The staff are so friendly and helpful they can't do enough for you.
The building is kept immaculate as are your rooms.
The concierge heard us talking about a restaurant we were going to and promptly produced 6 vouchers for a glass of prossecco each.
The hotel is perfectly situated in the city centre walking distance from everything. ",5,2018,11,26

Extremely attentive staff from reception, to bar to restaurant. Luxorious setting in the hotel and bedrooms. Highly reccomend and would definitely want to return! The deal in the resturant for guests was also really good value for money.",5,2018,11,26
226,well deserved ratings,"booked here with a friend for a ""girls"" night out.right beside the Grand Opera House were we had a great start to our evening.from the moment we arrived to our check out all the staff were helpful and c0urteous.the hotel is beautiful and in the perfect position for a trip to Belfast",5,2018,11,26
226,Couples weekend break,Such a lovely hotel in the centre of Belfast. Such a great location for exploring the city and only a 5 min walk from the Christmas markets. The rooms were fab with a lot of little thoughtful extras. We would highly recommend and hopefully return in the near future. ,5,2018,11,25
226,Beautiful hotel with excellent service,"Everything has been thought of for the added experience. We went for our wedding anniversary And We arrived to a card in our room and a like chocolate cake on a slate with ',Happy Anniversary ' written on it which was a lovely personal touch",5,2018,11,25
226,Afternoon tea at the Fitzwilliam.,"Cannot praise the Fitzwilliam staff enough for making my wife's birthday treat so memorable. Amazing food, beautiful hotel and the best part, the amazing and friendly staff. Made us so welcome. I urge you all to treat yourselves. We will be going back soon to sample Christmas dinner.",5,2018,11,24
226,Loved our Experience ,The hotel is decorated beautifully and they‚Äôve thought about the details. It‚Äôs a great location next to Opera House near restaurants and the Crown saloon. It‚Äôs the staff that made our stay so lovely. They were friendly and helpful.,4,2018,11,24
226,Beautiful Hotel,"Lovely hotel, very close to everything. Friendly staff, lovely welcome and room was great too. Hot breakfast options for vegetarians were limited, however I was able to mix and match and make my own up and this wasn't too much trouble. We would definitely recommend the Fitz to anyone visiting Belfast",5,2018,11,24
226," Brilliant!","Fantastic experience. The room was beautiful and super clean. Bathroom is large with bathtub and shower. Breakfast is plentiful. Centrally located. The concierges really make the stay special and can take care of anything one could possibly need with ease and friendliness.  Ask them to set up a tour with Francis, tour guide extraordinaire. ",5,2018,11,22
226,Classy!,Upmarket hotel but not that over priced for what you get. We stayed here in December last year and again in November and both times we thought that it is one of Belfast's best hotels. Rooms are lovely and it has one of the best beds we have tried.,5,2018,11,21
226,"Superb Hotel, Fabulous Staff","This was our first visit to Belfast and we stayed for two nights at the Fitzwilliam.
We had a fantastic short break made even more special by our stay at this hotel.
The staff in their entirety are the nicest, kindest most friendly people I have ever met and cannot do enough for you.
The doormen in particular are so kind and helpful and a fountain of knowledge when you are unsure with anything whatsoever. They are a credit to the hotel but then I found this throughout my stay, the reception staff, housekeeping, dining room staff are just the same and obviously take pride in what they do.
The hotel is wonderful, the room are amazing, beds so comfortable, high standards of cleanliness.
There are no negatives, it‚Äôs the only place to stay when you go to Belfast. 
Ps
Make sure you have the afternoon tea it‚Äôs an experience not to be missed !!!",5,2018,11,21
226,Birthday weekend celebration,"A surprise overnight stay to celebrate a birthday. Such a relaxing hotel, perfect location, fantastic service and nothing too much trouble for any of the extremely helpful staff. Highly recommend staying here!",5,2018,11,19
226,second visit to this wonderful hotel,"second but certainly not last visit to this gorgeous hotel. Centrally located, very accommodating stuff & reasonably priced, with beautiful rooms and an indulging breakfast menu. If you are in Belfast this is the place to go.",5,2018,11,19
226,Weekend away,Really good city centre location. Staff were very friendly. Room very clean and food at breakfast was lovely. ¬£25 per day parking on top of room charge was a bit much even for city centre parking. Very enjoyable stay,4,2018,11,19
226,EXCELLENT,"Excellent hotel and ideally located near the hub of Belfast, staff very friendly and superb standard in all departments within the hotelWe booked a family room and had a wonderful time.Will definitely make a return visit to Belfast and specifically to stay at the Fitzwilliam hotel again",5,2018,11,19
226,Very well run hotel in the Centre of Belfast,"My wife and I decided to visit Belfast, and after some research we decided on the Fitzwilliam because of its location, and amenities.  

The pros:

You can't beat the location.  If you are attending an event at Ulster Hall it is about 5 mins walking.    Deanes EIPIC is about 2 minutes away.    You can get to City Hall/High street all in 5-10 minutes walking.  

Really good service.  Very attentive in relation to room service (we made use of the option the first night as we were a bit tired from travelling), the concierge service, and the bar/lounge staff who made everything feel so effortless for us.

Their room size/quality is quite good, and the bathrooms are quite adequate for 2 people (bathtub and shower included).  We both thought it was a nice room (we had an executive King room) to relax in when we got back from playing tourist, and after attending the commencement of the Christmas market.

Can't think of anything that I would mark as ""needs a bit of improvement"" with this hotel, as our stay was pleasant and the service very consistent.  Sadly, we were not able to have a meal at the restaurant because of some timing issues (ended up taking a bit longer to see the Titanic exhibit which I definitely recommend), so I cant comment on the quality of the restaurant.

In conclusion, my wife and I both thoroughly enjoyed our stay, and if we do decide to come back to Belfast, this will definitely be the hotel we come back to.",5,2018,11,18
226,"Nice, but not 5 star","My wife and I stayed here for the night for our anniversary. The hotel is very nice, really helpful and friendly staff and the rooms are nicely styled with plenty of room and a comfortable bed.
However, there were a couple of things that just meant the experience wasn't perfect.
Firstly, parking. I don't know why the amenities show parking as the hotel has none. McCauslands was full as was the car park around the corner which meant that we had to park quite a distance from the hotel.
Secondly, the room got really hot during the night. Whilst it is air-conditioned, the temperature was set at 22 celcius and we couldn't turn it down (the controller would not allow me to lower the temperature even though it was set to cool). After waking up due to being too hot for the 3rd time I turned it off and opened the window, but this meant we could hear all the road noise. So despite the nice room and comfortable bed I had a really restless nights sleep.
The breakfast in the hotel is really good, plenty of choice (all good quality stuff) at the continental buffet and the full cooked breakfast was delicious.
The toiletries etc supplied are all very nice. 
I would return but check the ac controller works when checking in and ask to move if it wasn't. ",4,2018,11,18
226,Wonderful stay. ,"Stayed here for 2nights at the weekend and was really impressed. Check in quick and girl on reception really nice and welcoming, concierge a great help with any questions we may of had. 
Reception area is beautiful and has a lovely gas fire, bar and restaurant is ok, just think for a 5star hotel it could be more upmarket.  We just had breakfast in the hotel and it was cooked to order and was beautiful, walk to bedrooms is lovely, nice carpets and mirrors on every bedroom door along the corridors, we stayed in executive king room and it was lovely but a bit small.. bed really comfortable. 
Overall really enjoyed our stay here. ",5,2018,11,16
226,A lovely place to stay,"When you walk in you immediately get a sense of the extra quality the hotel has. Everything is well presented and immaculate, you could argue almost to the point of being clinically so, but then the reception from the staff and little personal touches you see here and there brings across a more rounded warmth to your stay. The rooms are spotless, excellently appointed and well thought out, I mean it makes total sense to put shower controls on the opposite wall, why don't more hotels do that? Its the extra details and personal touches though which make the difference, like the nightly turn down service with chocolates and next day weather forecast, GHD hairdryer, USB charging plugs and your own personal umbrella to use. Breakfast was good, maybe the continental option could have had a bit more choice but if it wasn't there you just asked and it duly arrived. No bother, no fuss, just brilliant service. All in all, why stay anywhere else?",5,2018,11,16
226,Absolute Luxury,"The most luxurious hotel I have visited. Everything was perfect from start to finish. Staff were super friendly from the minute we arrived to the minute we left, nothing was to much hassle and they were more than happy to help. Rooms were superb, everything is thought out right down to the finest detail. Breakfast was amazing part buffet part table service and finally the location couldn‚Äôt have been better! Truely cannot wait to get back for another stay, 100% would recommend.",5,2018,11,15
226,Lovely hotel,"Best hotel ever! I loved our stay here. Staff very helpful and friendly.  Food was delicious, room very clean, a relaxing music was on when we arrived in our room. A small birthday cake and a lovely card was on the desk for me. I loved everything about this hotel. High recommend! ",5,2018,11,15
226,Perfection in Every Way,"Everything about this hotel is fantastic. The location is perfect, the rooms are beautiful, clean and comfortable. Super quiet, we never heard another person! And the staff is top notch, every single person you meet will exceed your expectations for high level customer service. This hotel is a 5 star luxury experience, yet the value will surprise you. Best hotel in Belfast!",5,2018,11,15
226,Great location amazing staff,A amazing hotel very close to city centre bars and shops. Hotel booked any tours we wanted of the city too which helped alot. The food at the hotel is amazing too as was the bar. Unbelieveable service from the moment we walked in the door. Will definitely use this hotel again for the next visit ,5,2018,11,14
226,Highly recommend the Fitzwilliam ,I have recently stayed in the Fitzwilliam for one night with my partner and must say it has been such a lovely city break. Staff from check in to check out were so attentive and helpful with dinner recommendations and things to do in Belfast. Rooms are modern and spacious and breakfast was delicious . Will definitely be back! ,5,2018,11,13
226,Juniour deluxe suite,The welcome was good and upon entering the room (7th floor junior  deluxe suite)the music was softly playin in the background with dimmed lights making for a lovely entrance.The view was fantastic over Cavehill and Belfast and we will definitely be stayin again,5,2018,11,13
226,"Stylish, friendly central location","Stayed here recently for business with my husband. It‚Äôs centrally located close to the airport transfer bus and city centre. It‚Äôs very modern and luxurious, with lovely rooms, coffee machines, cafeti√®re and a teapot which makes it feel homely! The cocktail bar is lovely and a good pre-dinner place to meet. We experienced a bit of noise due to renovations during the day but the hotel were brilliant and compensated us with some drinks etc. The customer service was excellent. I would definitely stay again...lovely city and fabulous hotel!",4,2018,11,13
226,Excellent hotel for a visit to Belfast,"Upon our arrival we were warmly greeted. It's the small touches that made this hotel stand out. For example, the bellhop was an enormous help, from taking care of having our car parked to running our bags up to our room. I liked this hotel for its location; it was a healthy walking distance from all parts of the city, yet it feels like it has its own space. For us, it was a perfect headquarters for our two day stay. It's a hop-skip-jump from the Crown, which although is a known heavily touristed place, is definitely worth the visit. The hotel is a healthy walking distance from other attractions throughout the city, there are nearby bank machines, and plenty of good restaurants in the area. ",5,2018,11,12
226,Disappointment at the Fitzwilliam,Parkkng was a problem as we had not prebooked the valet parking. We were hunted out of the restaurant on Friday evening as the waiter wanted to go home. Refused to serve de caffeinated coffee- only instant available. Sunday morning for room service a joke. Claimed that it was Sunday morning - no grapefruit juice. Not up to 5 star standard.,2,2018,11,12
226,Very beautiful hotel,I really enjoyed the couple of days that I had at the Fitzwilliam Hotel in the Centre of Belfast. Great hospitality and very comfortable room for me to rest while visiting the city on business. Very good hotel.,5,2018,11,11
226,excellent location,This was our first visit to belfast. Beautiful city. We only stayed two nights but it was nice. Hotel was clean. I dont like black toilets but nevertheless it was still clean. Shower pressure was great. Room was nice and spacious with a good city view. We ordered room service and the food was actually good for in house dining. I would stay there if i go to belfast again. Very friendly staff at reception.,4,2018,11,11
226,"nice hotel, great service","Lovely, comfortable room. Everything neat and clean.The bed is really comfortable. Staff is welcoming and friendly. Tasty breakfast. Excellent room service. Close to public transportation and within walking distance of opera, City Hall and shopping streets. Pleasant stay! Truly recommended",5,2018,11,11
226,One night stay ,"I‚Äôll start out by saying something positive and that is that the staff was lovely and welcoming. The hotel itself was a disappointment.  Did not feel that the pics on the website were a good representation of reality.  We stayed in the executive room.  The room was dark and a bit tattered and dated.  Truthfully, was relieved we were there only one night.  Also had drinks at the bar and the area was also worn looking and just didn‚Äôt care for the decor.  The aesthetic of the hotel overall was not to my liking.  Could be that it was dated, but the hotel didn‚Äôt feel especially clean.  They do have onsite parking, but I guess it was full.  We parked at the lot down the street which was not a problem. Very short walk. ",2,2018,11,11
226,Fabulous ,"Super hotel , rooms fab , staff attentive and  food excellent.. the bar has a great vibe , love the cocktails and Brian is a great host . We also had a great meal In the restaurant . Worth the money , will be returning. ",5,2018,11,11
226,Over night birthday celebration,"There was definitely a number of issues while staying with the Fitzwilliam hotel, from the phone call to arrange surprise for my husband's 50th, in restaurant, not been made aware the pillows could be changed, room service arriving 40min late and been told to pay for drinks we didn't order.",2,2018,11,11
226,Beautifully appointed hotel,"This was my fist visit to Belfast.  The hotel was beautiful.  I was exhausted when I arrived at my room with my bed turned down, and soft music playing.  Can't get better than that.  The food was very nice, and the staff was excellent.",5,2018,11,09
226,"Fantastic Hotel, let down by breakfast experience","The hotel gave the perfect overnight stay experience, the room was high spec with a breath-taking view and lovely details from the staff. The letdown of the stay was breakfast, we waited over an hour from order to service. This took away from the experience of using the room more that morning as well as the breakfast itself, we had to rush it to get away. It was a real stain on what was otherwise a fantastic experience in a wonderful hotel in a gorgeous city.",3,2018,11,08
226,2 night stay,"Rooms were lovely up to standard and the housekeeping did a marvellous job throughout our stay. On our first night we ate in the restaurant the drinks service was slow we ordered wine with our food and it came right beforr the main course. I found ""sebastian"" treated us as a hinderance  no basic manners or welcoming vibes. The young man on the desk was very welcoming and tried his best to accommodate us as best he could. Overall we will return but just give dinner a miss and eat elsewhere.",4,2018,11,08
226,Luxury with perfect attention to detail,"I absolutely loved staying at this hotel! 

First impressions were great with a lovely reception area, friendly staff and efficient check in. 

My room was amazing, luxury finish, massive bed which was super comfy, spacious bathroom and plenty of nice touches to make it feel homely. 

The bathroom far surpassed my expectations with both a bath and shower (I think I was in an executive room though so this may vary). It even came with a candle to take a super relaxing bath! Shower had great pressure which is always key for me! 

I also went to the restaurant for dinner which was amazing, food was absolutely spot on and when taken from the residents menu option a very reasonable price! 

I can‚Äôt wait to come back to this hotel for pleasure rather than business and get a chance to look around Belfast a little more!",5,2018,11,06
226,Birthday in Belfast,A first time visit to Belfast to celebrate a special birthday with friends. We couldn‚Äôt have asked for a better place to stay. The Fitzwilliam is lovely and the staff were so welcoming and helpful - nothing was too much trouble and the concierge helped us to plan a tour of the city. We also drank cocktails in the bar and had a fabulous meal in the restaurant. We can‚Äôt recommend the hotel highly enough and we‚Äôd love to visit again,5,2018,11,06
226,Nice City Hotel!!!,"The Fitz was wonderful.  The front desk people were so charming and helpful. Great city location and very nice rooms.  We would stay here again when traveling to Belfast.  Very nice craft cocktail bars near by, Rita's and The Perch.",5,2018,11,06
226,Pleasant stay,"The hotel room has some lovely touches such as earplugs, deck of cards, candle in the bathroom. The reception area and hotel in general is modern. The meal was enjoyable however I was surprised the restaurant had booths not the traditional chair & table as it doesn't reflect the opulence of the rest of the hotel.. but that would be my only critism. I would definitely stay again but maybe have a meal elsewhere.",4,2018,11,05
226,Superb,This hotel is a must for a luxurious break and is so convenient to the Grand Opera House. The staff are friendly and very knowledgeable and are on hand to help no matter what the query. The hotel is easily found and the valet parking was a must for us.,5,2018,11,05
226,Competent but possibly overpriced.,"The hotel is quite nice, and the staff are polite, friendly, and competent. It is clean. The location is good; walking distance from City Hall, shopping, and plenty of restaurants.

That said, I would probably not stay here again. I didn't really see the value as a ""5 star"" hotel. I don't know much about Belfast, perhaps the standards here vary. The minuses of this hotel , I found it to be dark, the parking situation was  stressful, (as one might expect from a 4 star but not a 5 star), and I never did find any phone charging docks near the bed in the room. That might sound like a small issue, but after time away from home, it is unpleasant to have to stand by the desk to use one's phone. Maybe I didn't look hard enough for the dock.

Everyone was very nice here, and trying very hard ,  and you might like it. 

Celiac traveler note: You can walk about 7 minutes to a M&S food hall to stock up on the usual gluten free supplies. It's convenient in that aspect. There is a Tesco Express closeby but that location did not have any gluten free supplies.

Enjoy.",4,2018,11,05
226,First time visit ... ,"This was our very first time staying at The Fitzwilliam Hotel, upon arriving we were greeted with a lady, cheerful and welcoming. We got checked in and went our room. The decor on the way to the bedrooms is dimly lit and calming. On entering the room I was taken back, it was the most beautiful hotel we have stayed in. It was clean, well presented and very modern. Lovely view out the window. The bed was super comfy and the pillow's were just right (something that I can be very fussy over) There was everything we needed in our room minus some teabags which was quickly replaced.
We headed into town for a night at the Red Bull showdown, upon returning, the fire in the lobby was lit, people were chilling and it as miles away from the busy streets of Belfast. Our room had been turned down, Windows closed, dimly lit and lovely chocolates on the bed and water on the bedside. That wee bit extra makes the finishing touches. We had a great nights sleep, very little noise aprt from the odd siren which is expected in a city centre. We headed for breakfast the following morning and again we were warmly greeted and explained to of how the service works. We both ordered eggs Benedict, food wasn't overly warm, small portions compared to most places and not very much sauce, small details which I'm sure can be improved on. The rest of the self service breakfast looked gorgeous also. 
We would love to return to the hotel, a little out of our usual price range but it would be nice for a special occasion. Thank you guys! ",4,2018,11,05
226,Service with a smile,The ideal place for a post theatre drink after visiting the Grand Opera House.  The surroundings were plush and the welcome was warm from Patrick Orr in the hotel bar. Patrick shook up the most delightful espresso martinis. The service was excellent and his smile brightened up a cold Belfast night. Thank you Patrick. We‚Äôll be back.,5,2018,11,04
226,Not as good as previous stays,Disappointing that after paying ¬£350 for a two night stay the hotel holds a ¬£300 deposit on top of this which isn‚Äôt released for a further week. Strange way of doing business and wanting return custom. Also silly things that really make a ok stay into a great stay. This time round out window wouldn‚Äôt close so heard traffic noise all night and because the hotel was full we couldn‚Äôt be moved. Also this was the first time taking breakfast and unfortunately we were sat at our table and not told a thing about how it worked. We had to ask other guests. Very poor. Other than that the hotel is beautiful and I do believe we will return after experiencing other hotels in the area.,3,2018,11,04
226,30th birthday!,"My second time staying in the hotel and was once again very impressed! Be great if extended the bar as found ourselves searching for seats on a couple of occasions but no big deal! Will book again definitely, location & rooms are super ",5,2018,11,03
226,Not worthy of 5 Stars,"I stayed for one night with family. The hotel is very central for sightseeing and shopping. Rooms are comfortable and clean, but certainty not 5 star standards are little bit tired. We ate dinner in the restaurant food was tasty. Breakfast was a real let down. Full Irish breakfast is ¬£20.00, to my shock it came with 1 sausage 1 rasher pudding, egg, tomato and fried bread. My partners came with no rashers!!! When I spoke to a member of staff about this she said she would pass on my comments to the chef, but said that‚Äôs what it consists of, I really thought they just forgot to put on the extra bacon and sausage, also one slice of toast each is given with the cooked breakfast. 

I would stay here again but would just opt for room only.

Staff on arrival were very friendly and helpful. 

",3,2018,11,03
226,great location - lovely hotel,Hoel is a great location for a Belfast visit. Park across the road for better price parking. Staff very friendly. Breakfast was included in the price and was excellent (contrary to other reviews i have seen). Slight noise from room next door could be heard + towels were not up the standard for a hotel  like this. A very positive experience overall though. ,5,2018,11,03
226,Superb,"My wife and I stayed here for a 2 night city break. 
The location is right in the centre of the city with parking 50yards across the street. 
The hotel and food are fantastic. Huge rooms with great bathrooms. And a seating area. We ate breakfast both mornings which was amazing . Had a 4 course meal on our 2nd night which was lovely and quiet cheap compared to close by restaurants. 
I would recommend this hotel for families and couples. And will return again. ",5,2018,11,03
226,Cocktails ! ,"We love to stay at the Fitzwilliam in Dublin and visited the sister hotel for cocktails one night .
The decor is absolutely beautiful, a little bit like stepping into a glam scene from Agatha Christie (no murders though)
We were welcomed on a rainy night by a roaring fire and great staff. Our daughter was really welcomed, whereas other such trendy places definitely don‚Äôt like children. 
A perfect t place for a comfortable evening , next time we‚Äôll stay. 
",5,2018,11,01
226,Expected better,"Bathroom towel rail hanging loose on wall, repaired but wife then had to clean up after. Paint flaking off ceiling in bathroom. Elevator kept waking wife up through night. Positives are quality of breakfast and location to walk into city.",3,2018,11,01
226,Night cap,After a brilliant evening out on the town my friend from Canada and I stopped here for a cuppa coffee. The fire was roaring and apart from another table of three people we were the only ones in. The coffee was delicious and just what we needed. Surrounding was superb!!,5,2018,10,31
226,WE LOVE YOU FITZWILLIAM,a very luxurious stay....fantastic bar and we had the best of craic until 4 in the morning. all staff perfect customer service. made us feel very special. just has that personal touch in a professional manner. ,5,2018,10,30
226,Great stay,"Stayed in a great Superior King suite - room was clean and nicely decorated. Bathrobes and slippers and a nice candle by the bathtub put you in a relaxing mood for a bubble bath. Hotel itself at a superb location, with beautiful reception area and lovely, helpful staff. 
But sweet lord whats the deal with your restaurant?? It‚Äôs design looks like Eddie Rockets and the breakfast service is just the equivalent of an average cafe... sort out your restaurant and you‚Äôll have a flawless 5* stay...
I‚Äôd still come back tho, just wouldn‚Äôt book the breakfast ;)",5,2018,10,30
226,Room for Improvement,"Rooms need a face lift.  Management need training in dealing with genuine complaints; proper handling of complaints can resolve issues easily.  Breakfast needs improvement: consistently overcooked eggs, Irish breakfast not good enough to be worth ordering.  Avoid room 816 as the generator on the roof will ensure using the room during the day is not possible if the generator is in use.  If you want your room serviced while you are out, let them know; otherwise you may find it not serviced even after 4 p,m. when you return to your room for a relaxing afternoon.  Disappointing views on bacside of building from floors below 6.Great concierge staff, friendly reception staff, great location.  However take that away and it is an average experience.  4 star at best masquerading as 5 star and its gets away with it because the market in Belfast for 5 star city center hotels is extremely limited.",3,2018,10,30
226,Lovely Hotel,"Have stayed many times and wouldn't stay anywhere else in Belfast. Staff are very friendly, helpful and professional. Rooms are spotless and comfortable. The little extras like turn down service with chocolates on your pillow make it that little extra special!",4,2018,10,29
226,Exceptional!,"Just spent a long weekend at this hotel with my husband.   I cannot recommend this hotel enough.  It was outstanding!  Spotlessly clean and the customer service was the best I‚Äôve ever experienced.  Location was perfect and staff were very friendly, efficient and helpful and we just loved staying here. Wouldn‚Äôt stay anywhere else in Belfast now.  Thank you Fitzwilliam üòòüòò",5,2018,10,29
226,Central Location Luxury Style,"The Fitzwilliam is located in the center of Belfast and is easy walking distance to City Hall, restaurants, shopping and is right next door to the Royal Opera House.  Rooms are large and nicely decorated.  Baths are nice with soaking tub.  Nice view of city.  Restaurant food is good but not great.  Same with restaurant service.  Hotel front desk service is very helpful and bellman concierge knows all about the city.",5,2018,10,28
226,A Great Establishment,"We stayed here for 5 days.  First time for these Canadians in Belfast.  The staff are outstanding, made us very comfortable and met our every need. The concierge staff was outstanding; they were great ambassadors for the hotel, the city and the country.  Rooms are modern and maintained in excellent condition.  Cost is always a consideration for people; this is not a budget property. But we found the we received great value for the money we spent.  Central location was a great feature for us. We walked all over downtown Belfast from the hotel to many of the great restaurants.",5,2018,10,27

226,Lovely hotel,"Lovely hotel with very clean and nice rooms! Jason on the front desk checked us in and out of hotel and was fabulous! Very friendly and couldnt do enough! Had loads of knowledge of the local popular areas to visit. Turn down left the room ready for us when we got back which was a nice touch! Breakfast service was just okay which is why i havent give 5 stars - brought to our seats and offered tea or coffee, no description or explanation for buffet or ordering food , although when food came it was delicious, buffet quite small amd not much variety. Although all in all a lovely stay.",4,2018,10,25
226,Fantastic hotel in a great city,"We were greeted on our arrival and even though we arrived well before check in time the concierge took our luggage, gave us a good list of things to do and supplied us with umbrellas due to the adverse weather. When we checked in the luggage was already in the room which was spacious and luxurious. The breakfast selection was superb and once again the staff were great. Would definitely recommend this hotel to anyone.",5,2018,10,24
226,Excellent Stay,"This hotel was wonderful.  The staff was very helpful and friendly. The room was comfortable and the breakfast was a great way to start the day.  The turndown service at night was much appreciated.  It is in a fantastic, central location.  Would highly recommend!!",5,2018,10,23
226,Carol Clarke,"A superb first visit to Belfast...and in no small part due to the excellent stay at The Fitzwilliam. The staff helped us set up every tour we wanted, gave us all the right information to make every minute count. Delicious food, great service, five star all the way. We will return!",5,2018,10,23
226,Gorgeous high tea,"Loved the high tea in this place. It was a bit different in that it had a savoury starter of a small cup of soup and a posh sausage roll followed by traditional sandwiches, scones & cakes. Very attentive staff in beautiful surroundings would definately recommend",5,2018,10,22
226,Wonderful time in Belfast,We spent 3 days at The Fitzwilliam Hotel Belfast. From the moment we arrived we were well taken care of. We were on our wedding anniversary trip to Ireland. The front desk staff went above and beyond to make us feel comfortable.,5,2018,10,22
226,Lovely hotel,"Very comfortable hotel located close to city centre. Friendly staff and well appointed guest rooms. Warmly greeted upon arrival. We dined on one night in hotel restaurant, and it was excellent. Breakfast hit and miss, it was very busy on Saturday morning so quality not good-buffet not replenished, service slow etc. ",4,2018,10,22
226,Fantastic weekender,"One of the best all round hotels I have stayed in for customer service and facilities. Room was lovely too, but a little worn around the edges on close inspection. Still very lavish though. Hotel staff could not do enough. They really are excellent.",5,2018,10,22
226,Great experience,"Stayed here for one night with another couple and we both had an excellent time. Jason checked us in, he engaged with us and gave us recommendations on popular nightlife and bar venues. We had booked executive rooms and both exceeded our expectations. It was the little touches that really made a difference - tea light candle by the bath, water bottles by the bed, great selection of tea and coffee, giving an umbrella to use for the duration of your stay and other simple but effective touches. It was my partner‚Äôs birthday, I had told the hotel and they had a slate with happy birthday written on it and a lovely chocolate brownie with fruit on top and also a birthday card waiting in the room when we arrived - he loved this! Coming back to the hotel later that evening we ordered room service - cheese and ham pizzas - they were lovely. We went for breakfast the next morning about 9:30 or so and it was pretty busy but we got seated straight away, got our tea and coffee, ordered our cooked breakfast and picked up a few pieces from the continental buffet - good selection to choose from. At check out, with Jason again, we paid for our room service from the night before. Every aspect of customer service from this hotel as a whole was fantastic - in particular; reception, housekeeping, food and beverage staff. I‚Äôd 100% return to this hotel.",5,2018,10,21
226,Breakfast experience was poor,"Only downside to our stay was the breakfast..We had to wait 15 minutes before we got a seat,and we we eventually got in and seated there was loads of empty tables ready ?Then most of the buffet food was gone even though the service wasn‚Äôt over for another 30mins , no bowls , plates etc .The staff was not as professional/friendly as the rest of the hotel, waiter came out with wrong breakfast order , had to wait 15mins for our hot breakfast , wasn‚Äôt good value for money ..",3,2018,10,21
226,Wonderful hotel,Just had a great stay at the Fitzwilliam. Gluten free food was no problem. All the staff were helpful friendly and very good at their job! Would stay here again next time we are in Belfast.Would recommend this hotel to all Coeliacs and everyone else!,5,2018,10,21
226,Great hotel,"Really enjoyed our stay at the fitzwilliam. Good location for seeing Belfast, lovely hotel, rooms really nice. Loved the little extras like the tea light by the bath! The staff were friendly and helpful, I would definitely visit again",5,2018,10,20
226,Lovely city break great hotel,We were looking for a short city break and chose Belfast. The hotel was a good deal and a fantastic 5star service. The room was wonderful and the staff was friendly and helpful. The best nights sleep I've had for years,5,2018,10,20
226,One night in Belfast ,"Have stayed before when on business in Belfast and will use going forward. From the minute you enter the building the staff are excellent from check in to check out. Couldn‚Äôt be more helpful and friendly. The rooms are spotless and spacious, slept like a baby in the huge bed. Everything in the room to make your stay comfortable is there. Bath and separate shower with a great selection of toiletries. Came back to room to find bed had been turned down and chocolates on the pillow, nice touch. Breakfast had a great selection of cooked or continental, freshly cooked omelette with choice of contents was no bother when asked for. Good value for a top hotel, good location if on a weekend away. Excellent. üëç",5,2018,10,20

226,Very good hotel,"Overall this was a very pleasant experience. Just small niggles with slow service in restaurant detracted from an excellent review.

226,Great location for visit to Belfast,"Great location for visit to Belfast and a nice hotel. Room was fine. Staff were excellent and very helpful. We had a meal included which was good.

226,One of the best...,"One of the best hotels i have ever visited. Fabulous hotel, faultless...cant wait to go back. The food was out of this world and the staff were absolutely brilliant. The Duck Roll has to be tasted as well as everything else on the menu. ",5,2018,10,18
226,Service with a BIG smile,"We stayed at The Fitzwilliam as part of our 50th wedding anniversary celebration.Everything was superb, down to the appearance of a lovely bouquet on our actual anniversary.Business or pleasure, this hotel should be your first choice.",5,2018,10,18

226,Beautiful haven in the city centre,"Stayed fir 3 nights, enjoyed our stay immensely. Beautiful interiors, excellent service, large and comfortable room, bathroom with both a shower and a bath. Excellent location, all the main attractions and restaurants in easy walking distance. 2 min walk to the train station and bus station as well - went to the countryside for a day.",5,2018,10,17
226,Great location but not a 5*,"Pros
Great location as you're right in the centre of town. The Grand Opera House is right next door which was convenient as we were going to watch a show. Staff very attentive and friendly. 

Cons: 
Rooms are noisy. The traffic outside is consistent and I had to wear ear plugs both nights. The pillows are not great, I had to call down to reception to bring two additional pillows and when they arrived they weren't in pillow cases so I had to swap the cases I had on the previous pillows to the new pillows. Room could do with a bit of updating to include a proper coffee machine (currently it's only speciality tea and filter coffee). There's a radio in the room but I would have expected to have been able to plug in my own device, or have a wireless speaker. They had an old CD player in the room - it's 2018?! I called down asking if they had an iPhone 5 charger to which they didn't have. 

I'd stay again but certainly wouldn't pay the price.",4,2018,10,17
226,"Great location, stunning hotel ",Perfect for a night away in the city. Location is perfect. Decor is beautiful an staff very friendly an welcoming. Breakfast options also great. Only complaint is Parking should be included considering price to stay. ,5,2018,10,17
226,Great experience,"We were here for a weekend break couldnt praise the staff enough from receptionist to resturant and bar service was second to none and freindy staff, really good food I give this hotel a 10/10 I will certainly stay here again",5,2018,10,15
226,Fantastic Hotel,"If there was such a rating as a 6 Star Hotel this would be a 6.

We didn‚Äôt use a cab the entire time we were there except from the airport to the hotel. ",5,2018,10,15
226,"Good location, friendly staff, not a 5 star hotel by any means","Good location with some nice bars and restaurants close by. Staff were very friendly. Rooms are nice but noisy, when I asked for 2 sets of ear plugs, they only provided 1. Beds are comfortable but pillows are hard. Breakfast is mediocre, coffee (supplement if you want a ""specialty coffee"") was very poor, staff were very nice in breakfast area. It's a reasonable 4 star.",3,2018,10,15
226,Great central hotel,This is a great hotel made better by the very helpful staff. In walking distance to the centre. Room 213 was spacious and very comfortable. Highly recommended. The breakfast  is cooked to order and high quality.The staff were keen to assist.,5,2018,10,15
226,Not what I expected,"Have checked out of the Fitzwilliam feeling underwhelmed and disappointed. 

A few points:
-Had emailed the hotel before check-in with a few small requests. No reply and none actioned. Disappointing as it was a celebratory trip and I would have happily paid for champagne etc in the room.
-Minibar was locked - not sure why!?
-Given an accessible bathroom which was just not comfortable
-Had to call 3 separate times before more towels arrived

Positives: Room was clean and spacious. 

Based on this stay, wouldn't return.",3,2018,10,15
226,Comfortable and convenient,"I have stayed here many times and the service is always excellent. The rooms are very comfortable and the hotel is well situated with access to everything you need in the city centre.

226,Surpassed Expectations,"We loved our stay at the Fitzwilliam. Everything from our arrival to our meals there were wonderful. The staff was kind, helpful and took pride in their work. We loved the location as it was easy to navigate the city and also an easy commute to visiting the friends in Bangor. We were unsure about how our stay in the city of Belfast would be, but the staff and accommodations put our worries aside. Thank you!",4,2018,10,11
226,Beautiful Hotel with Wonderful Location and Staff,"This is our 2nd visit to Belfast and both times we have stayed at The Fitzwilliam.  It is located center city in the historic district.  We enjoy the pub across the street - Robinson's Bar for Fish & Chips and Cottage Pie.  In the back of Robinson's Bar is Fibber Magee's which has live Irish Music.  Also, next door to that is the Royal Bar, which is the oldest bar in Belfast.The hotel is located close to the train and bus station.  Even though the hotel is in the heart of the city, the noise level in the hotel was low and did not disturb our sleep.  We were booked with a refundable room through a website; however, I checked about 14 days ahead of time on the Fitzwilliam site and there was a special that was lower.  The concierge is extremely helpful, so be sure and talk with them about suggestions.  The breakfast is wonderful.  Best eggs benedict in all of Ireland and Scotland, in our opinion.  The size of this hotel is perfect. We had a corner room that had 2 walls of windows and incredible views.  ",5,2018,10,11
226,Afternoon tea very poor,"This afternoon tea was for a 30th birthday present.

We asked for the champagne version. We never got offered any champagne.

The service was very slow. Waiting 10/15 mins for a coffee. had to go to bar and ask for water as we had no drink with afternoon tea.

The sandwich's were hard and the cakes were very dry.

The halloumi sticks and soup at the start were great.",2,2018,10,11
226,Great weekend in Belfast,"We felt very welcome at the Fitzwilliam. Helpful staff with good tips we could do in and around Belfast.We recommend making a bicycletour in Belfast, and a visit to the Crown, just around the corner of the hotel. The hotelbar and lobby are very pleasant to stay. On saterdaynight  there was live music, so great for relaxing after visiting the city.",5,2018,10,10
226,Room 612,"We had a lovely evening in Belfast. We had cocktails from the bar which were excellent. I had a burger from the bar for lunch. It was OK. It lacked taste. The chips were OK. We returned later to the hotel for dinner which was fabulous. We had a reasonably priced bottle of wine with our dinner and it was lovely. The service was excellent and the seats and table were comfortable. There were 2 Hen Parties in but everyone behaved and there was a nice relaxed feeling in the restaurant. As with the restaurant, the service in the bar was excellent. The bar is a little small though for a hotel this size. Our problem was with our room. It was small, which was OK. When we went to have a cup of coffee the only available socket we could find was on the unit beside the bed. So I had a boiling kettle next to me lying down. This could be dangerous. The real issue occurred during the night when I was woken by an overpowering smell of sewage in room 612. It continued to be an issue throughout the rest of the night even though I ran all the taps and shower and bath to make sure the U-bend was not dry. It was awful. We got up earlier than planned and had a really nice breakfast but on returning to our room decided we could not stay there and we left early. On leaving, we reported the problem. We were told that maintenance would look into it. We wrote an email and were offered an unspecified discount off some future stay at the hotel. This is a 5 star hotel. They have 5 star prices. Our room and the issues we experienced and the way they were handled lacked the finesse I associate with 5 star hospitality.",2,2018,10,09
226,lovely stay with fall at the fitz deal,"we stayed at the Fitzwilliam weekend beginning the 6th of October. we were celebrating a 10 year wedding anniversary and had a lovely card and cake on arrival at our room, the room was beautiful, overlooking a crane though so not much of a view but we didn't really notice to be honest we were out most of the day.  we had cocktails in the bar and a meal that evening which was beautiful and the surroundings were lovely. location ways the hotel is perfect, very welcoming and a also cosy on entrance. I would highly recommend and we will defiantly be back ",5,2018,10,08

We were very pleased with the service we recieved by all members of staff we encountered.

I would like to thank the staff for helping my partner with a lovely birthday surprise. We will definitely be back to the Fitzwilliam.",5,2018,10,07
226,Very nice hotel,We stayed one night but everything was perfect. The restaurant area need to be modernized a little cause it look a little old fashionable. Friendly and polite staff. The only thing that they need is spa & wellness ,5,2018,10,05
226,Best hotel! ,"We where in love with this hotel! 
First we arrived and coz we came in car (book the parking before coming) we parked in the entrance and they took the car to the garage. 
The staff is amazing! They where so welcoming and nice with us. 
They gave us recommendations since we entered and told us about the tours we might be interested. 
The room is really nice and spacious. 
It has a coffe machine and some tea, it has a couch and the best part is the bed because it‚Äôs so comfy in this hotel I couldn‚Äôt even stand up at mornings. 
The gym is small but it has the necessary for a good workout. 
we had a black taxi tour which it was 40 ¬£ and we got it from the hotel so they come get you and drop you back which it was convenient. 
I really loved the atmosphere and she service here. 
The location is perfect! We walked to everywhere around Belfast because everything was so close to the hotel. 
It‚Äôs really safe and convenient and you have a lot of restaurants, stores and little supermarket in walking distance or even crossing the street. 
Coming back if I even visit Belfast! ",5,2018,10,04
226,Central and welcoming,"First visit to Belfast and stayed two nights here. The most impressive part of the stay I think was the excellent service and attention provided by every staff member that we dealt with, so helpful and welcoming. We did eat in the restaurant and visited the bar and both were good. Room was spacious enough and very comfy bed. Points lost on large hole in bath robe, which obviously missed quality control in the laundry and inability of barman to make basic cocktails not on the menu. However would definitely stay again.",4,2018,10,03
226,"Location, location , location",The Fitzwilliam is the premier hotel in Belfast. They have one of the most helpful concierge service I've seen at a hotel. I would like to especially single out Nigel. Such a kind and elpful person. Dining staff also very good,4,2018,10,03
226,Most enjoyable birthday,I had the most enjoyable birthday at the fitzwilliam hotel Belfast.  My husband took me to Ireland and here is where we stayed.  The staff was exceptional and very helpful for tourist. Can't wait to go back.,5,2018,10,02
226,"Excellent stay, centrally located","My wife and I spent one night there, enroute to  the Antrim coast.  Nice stay, generally efficient.  Bathroom was interesting.  Must have slotted us into a handicapped room, as there were no barriers to the shower water getting everywhere.  Not sure how that happened.  We did have a bit of a challenge getting a receipt, as their printers were not working well, or at all.  Parking is expensive, we parked down the street.  Overall, a good stay and would likely go back.",5,2018,10,02
226,First class service ,"We stayed in an Executive King, the room was well equipped, spacious and beautifully decorated. Check in was swift with a welcome help to our room with our suitcases. The bathroom was great with a large bath tub and candles, perfect for relaxing. The bar manager James provided excellent service and we enjoyed the cocktails, the Pear Drop was fantastic. The concierge booked us a taxi tour with Gerry who was absolutely marvellous, the tour is a must see. Finally Peter went above and beyond with one of our requests, he was so helpful and courteous, a credit to the hotel. Would stay here again for sure and highly recommend the central location. 5 stars! ",5,2018,10,02
226,Good and Not So Good,"The hotel is well located and fairly modern. The bathrooms are visually bold but the design / fitout is fairly poor ... little space to place toiletries, slippery shower base, no power point for hairdryer etc. Our room appeared to be 'fitted' with the king bed .... leaving very little room on one side near the wall. Breakfast was very disappointing for the money .... the chair I was asked to sit on was filthy with previous food spillages and the selection for the continental was well picked over and limited on the one occasion we visited. The complimentary newspaper was never received over the two days. Time for a serious 'hands on / walk around' from management to pick up the short comings and get things back the way they are meant to be.",3,2018,10,02
226,Enjoyable Stay,Came to stay here with my wife as we were visiting a trade show. This is one of the friendliest hotels with the nicest staff we have ever come across! Food was fantastic and rooms were lovely. I don't usually leave reviews but  I could not find one flaw in our stay. Well done you guys!! Top Class!!!,5,2018,10,02
226,Great hotel.,"Great location right in the heart of town. Friendly staff, from the moment we arrived we were made feel special.  Lovely room. Really relaxedatmosphere. Had a great time. Dined in the restaurant and had a lovely meal. Availed of the residents‚Äô special, four courses for ¬£25. Was really good. Would certainly recommend this. ",5,2018,10,01
226,Underwhelming for the price. Basically premier inn with a paint job.,Great Central location. Friendly and helpful staff especially the bar manager and concierge. Fairly small bedroom despite booking the executive room. Some damp on bathroom ceiling. Don't think it justifies the price. I have stayed in better  places and paid less. ,3,2018,10,01
226,Amazing hotel‚ù§Ô∏è,"My husband and I stayed at the Fitzwilliam for one night. I have to say the service from we walked through the door until we were leaving was incredible. The hotel is the nicest we have stayed in and we have stayed in alot. I will definitely be booking again, can't reccomrec this hotel enough. Best night sleep we have had any any place we have ever stayed!",5,2018,09,30
226,Excellent hotel in a great city,It was our first trip to Belfast and we really couldn‚Äôt have asked for better accommodation and information. The staff provide exemplary service. We will definitely return. The room was spacious and cleverly clean. The breakfast service is first class with a really wide selection. One minor suggestion would be to have some tea/coffee making facilities in the room.,5,2018,09,30
226,"Excellent room, good breakfast","My room at the Fitzwilliam was a very good size with a large, and comfortable bed, a decent sized desk and a sofa. The bathroom was also good with an excellent shower. Pretty much all you need for a 1 night business stay!
The breakfast was also good...plenty of choice on the cold buffet with hot food served directly from the kitchen, a nice change from the hot buffet in most hotels.
Hotel location is also great, right in the city centre.",5,2018,09,30
226,Beautiful room,"We stayed on the 9th floor in the new city view rooms. The decor is beautiful and the bed comfortable. Classical music was playing when we arrived and we appreciated the touch. Turn down service is exceptional. A very nice shower as well as a separate soaking tub. The only criticism is that the included breakfast is pretty slim for choices. Otherwise, I could not recommend this property enough.",5,2018,09,29
226,Birthday Treat,"Just left the The Fitzwilliam Hotel , we stayed in an executive room it was modern , and clean expected it to be more though for the money I paid ¬£180.00 , little extras still don‚Äôt add up to the five star rating we would have got those extras in a 3 star ! but we had an enjoyable stay cocktails and dinner in the lobby bar was a delight staff very switched on and obliging . ",5,2018,09,29
226,Business trip to Belfast,"I have stayed at the Fitzwilliam twice now for business and both times it has been a friendly, welcoming efficient hotel at an excellent standard and value for money.  I expect to be returning to Belfast and will use them again",5,2018,09,28
226,Nice location and very friendly staff,"The hotel is really nice, the staff are extra friendly, and the location is good. I thought the room was really small compared to the price. They have the classic FM channel always on in the room which really added to the experience. If I come back to Belfast I will infidelity stay here but will request a bigger room.",4,2018,09,27
226,Work Trip,"I stayed at The Fitzwilliam for work, and this was my second time to have booked one of their rooms. I honestly would advise anybody to stay there; whether for work to just leisure.The location of the hotel is very good, since it gives easy access to the city centre (2-5minutes walk), restaurants, the city hall, most importantly, not far from Belfast City Airpot (Georg),etc...Members of staff are very friendly and very professional. I could go on and on, but honestly, I have had a great experience.One more things, the rooms are very clean, towels, dressing gowns, drinks, room service provided during your entire stay:-).I would highly recommend anybody to stay there; you would not regret it.The price per night is also affordable.",5,2018,09,27
226,Truly a sub-par hotel.,"As others have written here, the Fitzwilliam Hotel Belfast is all show and no substance. Liam the concierge is wonderful, and James in the bar gave great service, but everyone else seems sour and unconcerned (and probably overworked). 

The food is probably the greatest disappointment‚Äîthe omelet they serve doesn't even measure up to one you order at your local Denny's. We're vegetarians, so our options are limited, very limited. 

On our second day staying here, a big tour bus (or several of them) came in, so breakfast was chaos‚Äîdirty tables, few places to sit, food not kept ready, service poor.

A close inspection will show that poor maintenance is leading to pre-mature aging of this hotel. Dust lurks in corners, paint on doors and doorways is chipped and not repaired, light on one of the lifts was burnt out... little things like this that you'd expect in a 2-star hotel or a motel, but not in a supposedly 5-star place that charges top dollar (well, pounds, of course).

The bathrooms, though stylish looking, lack practical amenities, like a shelf upon which to store your toiletries. There is but one skinny glass shelf over the pedestal sink. Extremely inconvenient‚Äîbut pretty.

The overflow in my bathtub was broken; the water that went into that hole ended up on the floor, soaking under the bathroom wall and into the carpet in the bedroom, hallway and under the closet. I had to wait most of the day to get moved to another room.

The bathmat had a stain on it and was as threadbare as an old handkerchief.

My friend who stayed in an adjacent room kept having problems with her electronic key; we had it replaced three times, and still it worked only about 1/3 of the time. 

The towels are scratchy. Bathrobes are provided, but they, like the towels, are not soft and inviting. They were old and fraying.

This is NOT a five-star hotel. Just because they charge a lot doesn't mean that they are up to the requirements of such a rating.

Avoid the disappointment: go elsewhere. The 4-star hotel we stayed at in Dublin (The Grand Hotel, Malahide), was far superior to this joint, provided better service and way better food.",2,2018,09,26
226,Amazing place,"Excellent hotel and stay, dinner was lovely and staff in the hotel very kind and helpful. Highly recommended to stay and dine. Always available on any request and calls,really amazing experience with our stay. ",5,2018,09,26
226,A tad  over rated,"We paid ¬£176 per night for a deluxe room. It is a beautiful room but slightly overpriced. The room had a large shower and a bath. Cooked breakfast was nice but very small portions.  No sauce could be found! Bar food was delish and guy singing was great, the bar had a nice atmosphere. We tried the restaurant but felt we had to whisper as tables are so close together and no music to set the tone, that coupled with not being able to read the menu as it was mainly in French was enough to make us leave before ordering and going to the bar. It is a lovely hotel and all the staff were nice.  We normally stay in nice 3* hotel but splashed out for a special occasion and honestly I couldn't tell you were the extra ¬£60ish went.",4,2018,09,25
226,Fantastic hotel and great staff,"I will definitely recommend this hotel. The room was top class, food was great and staff extremely helpful. There were a couple of mix ups with the drinks bill at dinner and at checkout but was soon resolved with not much fuss.The only negative was our room neighbours on both sides were extemely nosy so we were awake half the night. This is not the hotels fault so it won't put me off going back ",5,2018,09,24
226,Enjoyable stay,The hotel was perfectly located as we were going to the grand opera house for a show. Very busy hotel staff friendly rooms beautiful had a lovely stay. Car park booking advisable. Value for money also  ,5,2018,09,24
226,One of the best hotel I have stayed in,"Perfect location in the centre of Belfast with lovely modern bedrooms. The breakfast was very impressive although the dining room itself wasn't that nice. The real highlight was the friendly staff, who really impressed me.",5,2018,09,23
226,Wee treat disappointing,Staff were lovely food average for a five star hotel and bar disappointing no atmosphere room was nice wouldn‚Äôt go back for the money have stayed in better hotels not five star and enjoyed them a lot more,3,2018,09,23
226,Superb from start to finish,"This is a great place to stay. Centrally located, the rooms here are big, modern and clean. Breakfast was excellent, although not included in our rate, we got it for ¬£13.50 by booking it at check in. Good bar too.",5,2018,09,22
226,Pre Theatre Dinner,"My mother and I went here last nite for the pre theatre dinner before going in to the Opera house, first of all I am going to comment on the service, from we arrived till we left it was OUTSTANDING, I CANNOT FAULT THE SERVICE OF THE STAFF one little bit, now for the food, my mum got Caesar salad to start and I got the scallops, they were enjoyable, now for the mains, my mum got the beef, she said it was lovely, I got the lamb, NOT GOOD, my plate of food was cold , my lamb was a bit tough, but I ate it because the mains were a bit slow on coming out and we were on a time limit because we were going to a show, we ordered calypso coffees and when they came down they were freezing, we have ate in the restaurant on several occasions and last nite was the worst. I have only gave a score of 3 because of the food, that's what let them down.",3,2018,09,22
226,A 5*Hotel with 2*food,This hotel is brilliant in location.superb in decor and facilities yet with sub standard food.We had a pre theatre meal which was of a lower standard than we enjoy at our local pub.My husband found his acceptable while mine was inedible.Which hotel kitchen cannot put together a simple Caesar salad or cook a herb crusted chicken supreme without it being soggy on the outside and dry inside?The waiter explained that the menu had just changed that evening-no excuse!,4,2018,09,21
226,Biz and Break ,The Fitzwilliam is a class act. Great front of house and beautiful rooms. Sadly we found the room to be noisy ( street noise and cars at all hours midweek). We were offered a room change which wasn‚Äôt much different but we declined. So it‚Äôs a four stars from us. ,4,2018,09,20
226,Excellent hotel in Belfast,"We stayed for 5 nights at this comfortable central hotel .It is close to lots of attractions within the city .
The staff were very friendly and helpfully especially the concierge staff who went above and beyond to help us with making our stay the best it could be",5,2018,09,19
226,No title,"This is an attractive hotel in a central location convenient to theater, restaurants, shopping and museums. Staff was accommodating and courteous. Food and bar were well prepared, creative and excellent.",5,2018,09,18
226,Great hotel and location,"Nice room but could use more accessible electrical outlets.  Bathroom had a soaking tub and separate shower.  Not a lot of counter space in the bathroom, tricky light switches.  Well appointed room, robes, slippers, chocolates and turn down service.  Decent bar but a little on the small side.  Super wonderful conceirge service.  Very friendly and knowledgeable and personable.  Liam was especially helpful.  Location is close to bars, restaurants and shopping.",5,2018,09,17
226,"Great location, great staff","We arrived late...as in very late.

The front desk helped with everything - parked the car, took the cases to the room, checked in in seconds - all this allowed us to keep the baby sleeping. 

It didn't quiet work and the baby started crying at 2am just as we got to the room. Suddenly warm milk arrived and perfect - off the sleep he went again.

The room was comfortable and well designed. Lovely plush furniture.

Staff and especially the guest relations couldn't have been better - even small cars arriving for our crying child in the reception.

The location is great - everything is walking distance in terms of the City Centre. With a good pace you can even walk to Titanic Belfast.

One minor erk - we stayed for two nights....second breakfast was great, fresh and plentiful (we went down early). The first breakfast was at the other end of the scale - we went down a few mins before breakfast ended...and the cupboard was almost bare...and the food had been out most of the morning. I little disappointing. Mind you the restaurant staff were as brilliant as the staff in all other parts of the hotel.

One minor niggle - but we will be back.",4,2018,09,17
226,Charming high class hotel in the heart of the city with all the right perks.,"The Fitz is the nicest hotel I've stayed in. The service is polite, responsive and extremely helpful. The bed and the whole room is luxurious with just the right amenities and extras in the room. I loved the toiletries and the shower and bath. You cannot go wrong with the Full Fitz, though the wheaten bread, butter and jam is a must. I can't wait to be back!",5,2018,09,17
226,Absolutely an excellent experience.,"The room was clean and classically, beautifully decorated.  The staff was professional and courteous.  The restaurant was very accommodating with special requests on meals.  I plan to return for business and pleasure.  Thank you.       ",5,2018,09,17

The hotel is beautiful and well located in the city. The staff were very professional and helpful. The rooms were comfortable and clean.",5,2018,09,16
226,Amazing hotel!,"Such a beautiful hotel! The room was humungous with the most luxurious bathroom I‚Äôve ever had in an European hotel. Purchased the stay and dine plan which was super afffordable and great. The concierge and bellman were extremely efficient, courteous and professional. A big thank you to Liam for taking care of our parking issues! 

The food at the restaurant was greAt. Supper had a great variety and the roast was amazing! The breakfast was just as amazing with a good full irish breakfast! the one complaint was the service at the restaurant was bad. Not friendly, they seemed bothered and not focused on the client as compared with the rest of the service provided at the hotel.",5,2018,09,16
226,Fitzwilliam Belfast,Loved the hotel and will definitely be back. It was clean and comfortable. The staff was very friendly. The location can't be beat since you're right in the middle of the city. I liked the air conditioning as it can we warm and humid at times in Belfast.,5,2018,09,16
226,Definitely a Five Star Hotel,"Stayed one night and wished I had time to stay longer! Hotel is directly in city center. Staff was exceptional, friendly, professional and very knowledgeable. Our room had a king bed, loveseat and desk. Bathroom had tub and shower and a great heated drying rack which came in really handy. We got soaked on our tour that day and were able to dry our clothes to pack before leaving.  Large closet with safe, blow dryer provided, all we needed. Turn down service with chocolates as well. 

The lobby had a nice fireplace and seating area. 

We had breakfast included in our stay. Hot breakfast to order with lovely fruit, bread, cheese, pastry buffet. Very upscale! I had savory pancakes which included fried egg, bacon and delicious buttermilk pancakes and got fresh pineapple and baked apples from the buffet.

Excellent experience all the way around. I would stay here again if I return to Belfast. 

This was part of our Railtours Ireland 2 day Belfast tour. Thanks Railtours Ireland for booking us at the Fitzwilliams!",5,2018,09,15
226,Night out,"After having a preshow meal here before , we decided on our return to stay for the full performance... the service is excellent , bar snack food a good average, however it struggles to cope with seating being the main problem ..plus it lacks character, however the stay was excellent as was the quality of breakfast, which for the cost it had to be .. feeling flush give it a go ",4,2018,09,15
226,Luxury city centre hotel,"Such a great place to stay in the city centre. Friendly helpful staff. Stylish modern design, all of great quality. Loved the attention to detail, such as a candle in the bathroom for a relaxing bath. ",5,2018,09,15

226,A lovely find,"I was in Belfast on business for 2 nights, and booked to stay at the Fitzwilliam on the recommendation of our team who are based in the city. I was not disappointed! I had a very late arrival (11pm) after a delayed flight, but received a lovely welcome, including staff member highlighting that room service was available if I needed anything to eat. My room was lovely - very stylish and well appointed, including bathrobes and quality soaps etc. A small box with a couple of chocolates on my pillow were a nice touch. Breakfast the following morning was tasty and well presented, and I went off to my meetings for the day refreshed and happy. I'll be staying here again next time I come to Belfast.",5,2018,09,14
226,Great hotel,"Stayed for the bank holiday weekend. The nights to tour Belfast and it is ideally placed in the fab city. Concierge can help with maps and advice. Front desk very friendly and helpful.
Breakfast is hit and miss, some days the dirty plates were piled up on tables, and the buffet was running out of food. Mainly good but you need to chase the staff several times which isn't good in this price bracket.
Room was perfect, or lady was Anya or similar and she worked the room each day to fabulousness, well done. Lovely bathroom with bath and big shower.
I don't use the lift, always the stairs so that in a emergency you can do it. Plus walking is good. The stairs are not, the hand rails are disgusting, utterly caked in dust.
Reception had settees for afternoon tea. Great feeling and food looked good.
All told, nice place, needs some finessing from the leadership team on the detail.",4,2018,09,14
226,Celebration package. ,"Booked the celebration package as a surprise  for my husband‚Äôs 30th birthday. There is no doubt that for a one night stay in Belfast it is fairly pricey but very much worth every penny for a special treat. Included in the room rate was a bottle of prosecco, a 4 course meal each and breakfast the following morning. When we arrived a birthday cake and card had been left for my husband which was so lovely. All communication made with the hotel beforehand was excellent, the staff were very quick to reply. All members of staff were so friendly which makes all the difference when staying overnight somewhere. The food at breakfast and dinner was really delicious. I also had a glass of wine which was served nice and cold and not terribly expensive for a 5* hotel. In the room itself there was a radio speaker with Bluetooth so we could play our own music. The room has a box left inside with ear plugs, playing card etc....just a nice touch so we didn‚Äôt spend the entire time flicking through the tv. Room was so modern with a decent view of the city centre. Bathroom was lovely. You couldn‚Äôt fault it! The only tiny thing that I would point is that the four course meal
Included tea/coffee as your fourth course. My husband doesn‚Äôt drink tea or coffee at all and I just thought that for what I was spending over the course of the night that the waitress could have offered him another soft drink instead. Other than that one small detail we had a fantastic stay and hope to return some day. ",5,2018,09,13
226,Excellent choice in Belfast,"This was our first time at the Fitzwilliam in Belfast. Our only regret is that we didn't stay longer. The food was excellent, the room was great, the location was very convenient, and the service was fantastic. Overall, the Fitzwilliam went above and beyond our expectations in every category.",5,2018,09,13
226,A Haven in a Bustling City,"We stayed at the Belfast Fitzwilliam for 3 nights last month. The accommodations were spacious and elegant. The food was very good, and the staff very helpful. The concierge helped direct us to a non-touristy section of the city, where we had an amazing meal.

This will be my go-to hotel whenever I visit Belfast!",5,2018,09,12

226,Wonderful place to stay!,"My daughter and I stayed 3 nights here and can‚Äôt say enough positive about it!

Our room was large, bright and very well equipped with all needed amenities!!    Staff were all friendly (from Liam who was at the door when we checked in and showed us the room, explaining how everything worked, to Jacob, a lunch waiter on the day we left who was knowledgeable about gluten-free menu options).  The concierge offered consistent help (including when there was a minor glitch in one of our tours).  Staff were very gracious in allowing a later check-out time bc our train was a later departure time.

We had come from Dublin where our hotel was a huge disappointment.  The Fitzwilliam, while only minimally more expensive than the Dublin hotel, was head and shoulders better and more than worth it!

We very much enjoyed Belfast and the people and should we ever return would definitely stay at the Fitzwilliam!",5,2018,09,09
226,Amazing,"The Fitzwilliam is the best hotel we have ever stayed at. Every aspect from check in to departure was impeccable. The room was spacious, comfortable and finished to a superb standard and there was 
lots of little extras that made it really special.
The staff are superbly trained delivering exceptional service in a polite, efficient  and friendly manner. 
We had booked on a dinner, bed and breakfast basis and had intended going out to local bars in the evening but this didnt materialise as we had such a lovely experience in the hotel restaurant and bar.

Breakfast - was average-good the waiter wasn't great that we got!, other waiters able to explain the area +what was available - he just must have a bad morning start!!.

Alao they provide free snacks which we enjoyed.We went for dinner in the first floor restaurant and altho it was very busy we waited a long time for our cocktails which we had ordered before our food.they didnt arrive until we had finished our starters.we then ordered another two straight away and they didnt arrive till we had finished dinner.so that was a little disappointing as i expected more.the food on the other hand i cannot say a bad thing about it! Wonderful food!! Reception staff and door staff where very friendly and welcoming.overall we had a great stay and would defo reccomend this hotel to others,5,2018,09,02
226,Wedding anniversary... A few observations ,"Well I'm actually still here at the minute. Great room, great staff, lovely atmosphere, nice restaurant... However.... We left at 5pm to take in a show at the opera House next door and there were 3 trolleys outside peoples rooms who had availed of room service... Its now 10.40pm and they are still there. Housekeeping is letting down the rest of the staff. Also the light fittings across the hotel are crooked and loss in places, lifts, room and so on. The mens bathroom in the first floor restaurant have hooks on the doors which are literally a coat away from falling off. It's a shame because this is a lovely hotel but it shouldn't claim to be a 5 star... Its more 4...as in nearly but not quite. That said, if there's a problem I am the one person who will find it!! Lol ",4,2018,09,01
226,City break to Belfast,Fantastic place to explore Belfast. Will return as so much more to do. Staff are very helpful. Concierge arranged all our tours. Trip around the Falls & Shankill is a must but get a guide recommended by the hotel. Belfast feels a very safe place to explore. ,5,2018,08,31
226,Central location,"Luxurious rooms with huge bathroom (executive room). The bed was relaxing, you had the option of air con if you felt too hot and the breakfast had plenty of options to chose from, including gluten free. Concierge arranged a black cab tour of the murals and peace wall on our last day and because it‚Äôs so central you can walk nearly everywhere. Will definitely recommend to family and friends.",5,2018,08,31
226,Class hotel,"Loved this hotel. The rooms were unbelievable. Very very classy.

The cocktail bar was amazing. 

We ate in the bar and got steaks. Think they were the nicest steaks we ever had in our lives. The chips and sauce were beautiful too. 

Right in the center of belfast. Walking distance to castle court shopping center, victoria square also a shopping mall and the odyessy arena is only a short taxi ride away.

Highly reccomend this hotel",5,2018,08,30
226,"Overnight stay at Fitzwilliam, Belfast","Excellent hotel in the centre of Belfast, good sized bedroom with air conditioning, well laid out.Had dinner in bar, great meal. Bar manager very attentive.Breakfast included in room cost, good quality produce.",5,2018,08,30

226,Fantastic hotel ,"We stayed at the Fitzwilliam hotel for 2 nights during the August bank holiday weekend. We truly enjoyed our stay. The hotel has the wow factor with exceptional staff, food quality and high quality fixtures and fittings!
The hotel was in a great location, within a minutes walk from the city centre bus station and also the city centre itself, so is located close to many bars, restaurants and shops. We used a hop on hop off bus tour whilst in Belfast and the hotel is within a short walk to the bus route! 
All in all, a fantastic hotel in a great city centre!",5,2018,08,30
226,5 Stars-Yes!!!!,"We stayed at the Fitzwilliam Hotel in July--the first stop of our vacation in Ireland. From the time we pulled up to the front of the hotel until the day we left, we had the best time. Our room was beautiful. The food was great. We spent two nights in the lounge, eating and drinking. We enjoyed many conversations with the staff. They never rushed us, giving suggestions and answering questions.  James O'Donnell was the manager. We enjoyed sharing stories with him. We complimented him on his staff which included Patrick, Victoria, Beth and Kaotrina. We had the pleasure of having breakfast with Rebecca who took great care of our every need. We would be remisss if we didn't give accolades to the guest service staff who catered to every request we made. This includes Liam, the concierge who gave us great advice in regards to recommendations on where to eat, where to visit and exactly how to get there.   This was truly a 5 star hotel. We will definitely be back!!",5,2018,08,29
226,Brilliant Hotel,We stayed at the Fitzwilliam Hotel for two nights. We were made very welcome. The rooms are great. The bed comfy. The rooms clean. We didn't have breakfast only because myself wasn't well. Staff are friendly . Location near bus station. ,5,2018,08,29
226,Fantastic stay !,"My partner and I visited Belfast a few weeks ago. We couldn‚Äôt have picked a better hotel to stay in. The rooms have been recently renovated, the service in the restaurant was impeccable - James was especially helpful at breakfast. 

All in all, a great stay. Will return.",5,2018,08,29
226,One night stay,Amazing experience. Bed was very very comfortable. Room had all your needs with little extra touches.  A fantastic nights sleep. Evening meal was absolutely beautiful from beginning to end. Overall service was very good.,4,2018,08,29
226,Always a pleasure & best hotel food by far.,This was our third stay in Fitzwilliam Belfast and each year it gets better. The staff are so friendly and the food is really high quality. Make sure your stay includes breakfast as it's phenomenal! **,5,2018,08,28
226,A Gem in Belfast,"The hotel is gorgeous, rooms are well-appointed and pleasant, and the staff went the extra mile to be helpful, especially with advice about nearby dining.  The breakfast is stellar.  No complaints - this was a great (and extremely well-located) stay.  ",5,2018,08,28
226,Fantastic service and food!,"The staff at the Fitzwilliam hotel are amazing! Friendly, welcoming and extremely professional! The location was just perfect. The bar food and freshly cooked breakfast was delicious! We would highly recommend a stay in the Fitzwilliam, Belfast. üòä",5,2018,08,27
226,Perfect,Location is fantastic.We got the bus from the airport ¬£3.80 each return within one month.Less than a minute walk.All staff are fantastic bar staff very good.Consciage are excellent very informative nothing to much trouble.Lovely tall middle age man sorry forgot your name but he checked us in online flight.Steven Liam all good.rooms lovely everything you need.Water.Slippers plenty of everything Thing .Wonderful,5,2018,08,27
226,Overnight Stay,"A very enjoyable stay, all staff very helpful and friendly, room was very well equipped and very comfortable, the hotel is situated near shops and bars,would definitely stay here should I return to Belfast! ",5,2018,08,27
226,Nice but not 5 star,"Very pretty and well designed lobby and bar.  The bar staff were efficient and friendly.  Helpful desk staff made check in easy.  I had a deluxe double room.  The room itself is lovely and the bed comfortable.  But in the whole room there were exactly two accessible and available electrical outlets, one on just one side of the bed, and one next to the desk.  In tech-heavy 2018 this just doesn‚Äôt cut it.

But the bathroom was the worst.  It had a nice tub and very roomy separate shower.  So far, so good.  But there‚Äôs an odd design of the bathroom, which opens directly onto the room unless you close some folding doors.  At that point the bathroom becomes too dark to be very useful.  So you have a choice between sufficient light in the bathroom or having privacy.  To make matters worse, the small pedestal sink has nowhere to put toiletries other than one tiny glass shelf.  There wasn‚Äôt even a toilet lid to put things on, so I resorted to closing the toilet and putting toiletries on the toilet lid.  Every time I needed to use the toilet I had to move my toiletries.  Finally, there was no electrical outlet in the bathroom other than one labeled ‚Äúshavers only,‚Äù so forget about your electric toothbrush, waterpik or hair dryer.  (Where exactly is one supposed to dry her hair?)

Someone needs to look at the rooms with a practical eye and change things to accommodate the modern traveler.  

Bellman was supposed to bring us luggage stands but never did.  In short, there are just too many missing links for 5 stars, but given its pluses and excellent city center location, I think it deserves 4.

",4,2018,08,26
226,GOOD BUT NOT GREAT,"Three of us had a two course meal here on a Saturday night just before going to the theatre.  Two had salmon which was beautiful, the third asked for medium to well done steak.  It was pink and bloody in the middle when it arrived so it had to be returned to the kitchen to be cooked a bit more.  When it came back it was an improvement but still a little on the rare side.  To be fair, it came with another portion of chips which weren‚Äôt required.  One of us asked for ice cream for dessert and stated she didn‚Äôt like chocolate ice cream but when it came, lo and behold one scoop of chocolate ice cream!  We weren‚Äôt asked if we‚Äôd like tea or coffee and the tIme was wearing on so we just did without.  The staff were very pleasant but that doesn‚Äôt really make up for the other shortcomings on the night.  With so many other places to dine in we won‚Äôt be rushing back.",3,2018,08,26
226,disappointed,"rooms beautiful, but service poor, we were a party of 6 dinning celebrating birthday , can assure you we will never return due to rude and poorly trained staff, breakfast was cold and order were all incorrect , the waiter basically fired the plates on the table  , cold tea and coffee, and toast with mould on it !!!!!!, I can ensure we will never be back , I have stayed in better bed and breakfast accommodation,",2,2018,08,26
226,Its a shame the 5 stars doesnt reflect the service,Room beautiful..bed comfy..dinner tasty..service non existant. When i arrived i was disappointed as the receptionist was not very informative and did not listen to me when i sed i wished to pay by cash..Breakfast was disappointing with toast that was bluemould..i did not find the breakfast  to the quality of a 5 star establishment nor the waiting staff attentive friendly or helpful..however the housekeeping staff deserve 5 stars ,3,2018,08,25
226,Classy centrally located hotel in Belfast,"We only spent one night in Belfast as we drove around Ireland, but I'm glad we stayed at the Fitzwilliam. Beautiful hotel and very friendly and helpful staff. The lobby is beautiful, the rooms are updated, the little restaurant/bar off the lobby has some good lunch food. The breakfast seemed a little disorganized from the service and layout point of view, maybe because it was very crowded that morning. The decor in the breakfast restaurant seems a bit out of Alice in Wonderland. But all in all, a very nice hotel.",5,2018,08,25
226,Excellent Hotel in the heart of Belfast ,Modern hotel with courteous and friendly staff and first rate rooms. Contemporary decor and decent restaurant serving a good breakfast. Note however that there is a Starbucks opposite if you want something lighter and to save yourself ¬£15. There is valet parking but you need to pre-book as the hotel carpark fills up quickly. Very near the iconic Crown public house. ,5,2018,08,25
226,Overnight stay with Dinner / B&B,"Amazing hotel, would highly recommend it for a visit. Extremely stylish, luxurious, really friendly staff, fantastic food and great location. Great atmosphere, we will definitely be returning for another visit soon. üòä",5,2018,08,24

226,Weekend of culture and rugby ,"Just back from staying at this fabulous hotel. Staff were excellent, especially Sebastian in the restaurant who kept us entertained! Location was superb as everything was within walking distance. The room was large and had a very well equipped bathroom and beds were comfy. Would recommend cocktails in the bar and the residents‚Äô dinner offer which was excellent value and very tasty. Would thoroughly recommend the hotel.",5,2018,08,23
226,Lovely and Comfortable ,"I booked this visit for my mum‚Äôs birthday, so as a party of four ladies we had three rooms, all Executive Kings. Arrived at 10am & one of our rooms was ready which was great as it meant we could freshen up before we went shopping! The staff were so friendly, efficient and gave great customer service. The rooms were very clean and comfortable and of course the beds were huge! 
As part of the celebrations we booked to have afternoon tea in the lobby and it didn‚Äôt disappoint, there was so much that it was individually boxed up for each of us to have with a cup of tea in our rooms later in the evening! ",5,2018,08,22
226,Excellent service . Good location . Friendly staff . Small for a 5 star üåü though .,Friendly staff . Small size for a 5 star though . Should have a pool & spa . House keeping staff is good . Restaurant manager was welcoming . we would‚Äôve stayed longer if hotel was bigger with more facilities . ,5,2018,08,22
226,Best  hotel in Belfast.,D√®clan the concierge known everything's in The city made are stay amazing .if you're  booked to stay see Declan he's  the best .he will make your stay one to remember. We Will definitely be back to the fitzwilliam hotel .,5,2018,08,21
226,Fitzwilliam Flavour.,We spent three nights here and on arrival we were warmly welcomed by the concierge and they had already set a plan for the three days we were there. We asked when booking for their suggestions of what to see and their plan was brilliant. Where to go and where to eat. This is service. All the staff were fantastic.,5,2018,08,21
226,Fantastic Stay,"Had a fantastic stay here with my husband. The staff are friendly but professional, the food is excellent and the rooms are beautiful, albeit a bit small for having suitcases in as we had to manoeuvre around them quite a lot.Would definitely stay again. The valet parking service is such a bonus and well worth the charge for being so central.",5,2018,08,20
226,"Great Hotel, poor service","The hotel appearance is fantastic, it was all clean and well presented, as were the staff.This was booked as a birthday treat for my wife, and the hotel left a cake in the room along with a card, which was a nice touch.On the evening we met some friends in the bar for some drinks, great atmosphere, but the service wasn't up to 5 star standard. We had to chase rounds of drinks on more than one occasion.The most underwhelming part of the stay was the breakfast. I ordered an omelet, which arrived on an oversized plate, with no garnish. It was tasty, but presentation left a lot to be desired. My wife ordered the pancakes, without the egg, and the pancakes arrived with the egg. Toast arrived 5 minutes later, not as ordered. If they could get these little things right, then they would get 5 out of 5",4,2018,08,20
226,Fabulous Hotel,Best hotel bye far in belfast. Will be back soon the hotel went above and beyond. I can not say one bad word about this hotel  We were booked for one night everything about this hotel is out of this world. I wouldn't be staying anywhere else in belfast again,5,2018,08,20
226,Luxurious Stay,"The Fitzwilliam is a great hotel.  The locations is excellent, right in the heart of Belfast. The rooms are luxurious.  We had a superior king room.  It was roomy, and the king sized bed was awesome.  THe bathroom was spacious with a huge shower.  The staff and service are exceptional.  They are responsive, attentive, and thorough.  ",5,2018,08,20
226,Family Weekend at ‚ÄúThe Fitz‚Äù,"Hotel is excellent and has great location to get into the City Centre. The concierge was very helpful in organising a City Bus Tour ( would highly recommend) and organising a free shuttle to get us to the starting point. Breakfasts are excellent, the bar is a great meeting point and we were looked after extremely well from start to finish. Memorable family weekendü§ó.",5,2018,08,20
226,Highlight of my trip was staying here!,"Everything at this hotel was perfect and the staff was wonderful. They really make you feel at home and go above and beyond! Make a point to try the afternoon tea, we really enjoyed it. The rooms were lovely and had everything you would expect at a fine hotel. ",5,2018,08,19
226,"Well located, comfortable. Could improve the breakfast experience.","Well located (5mns walking distance from Belfast City Hall) hotel. The in-house parking was full when we arrived but fortunately there is a car park just across the street (which is less expensive). Rooms are spacious and comfortable, with free wifi. The breakfast in the morning is a bit disappointing, probably because there is only one buffet whilst at peak hour there can be many guests in the breakfast restaurant, giving you the feeling of being in a canteen.",4,2018,08,19
226,Lovely hotel ,"Great location in the heart of Belfast. The concierge and reception staff could not do enough to help with any queries that we had.
The room was very clean with nice minibar, tv etc. The breakfast was probably one of the best breakfasts for the price ¬£13.50 pp which was good value.
The only negative was that the room was quite noisy as looked out onto a busy road but I suppose staying in a city centre hotel then that should be expected. ",4,2018,08,18
226,Worst dining experience,"My boyfriend and I went away together to the Fitzwilliam for my 25th birthday. First of all our dinner was booked for 7:30pm, 8:30pm and we were still sitting with our empty starters plates. For both mains we ordered steaks, Darren wanted his medium to well done and I wanted mine blue. Our steaks came and the blood was running out of his and we didn't receive any steak knives, we had to use our butter knives to cut them. Then the waiters obviously forgot about us because we sat for so long before one waiter came over and took our plates off us at 9:00pm (2 hours for a starter and a main) and Darren then said about the steak and the waiter said about getting a manager down and we sat for another 45 minutes waiting. We then got up and asked if we could get a desert menu because our waiter kept walking past us and didn't come near us and a manger didn't come down to us. We felt like we were forgot about the whole evening and we got 200ml of water at the start of the evening and no refills. No one topped our water up. We left the restaurant at 10pm. Won't be back!",1,2018,08,18
226,Beautiful hotel,"I will definitely recommend the fitz William Hotel to anyone visiting Belfast. It‚Äôs great located, beautiful decorated in the lobby and I loved everything about it. The rooms are relaxed and luxurious at the same time. Very friendly and happy staff too.",5,2018,08,18
226,Horrendous don‚Äôt go!,"Decided to choose this hotels restaurant for our tenth wedding anniversary and it‚Äôs one of the biggest mistakes I have ever made. So many mistakes and poor service but to summarise it took an age to bring our wine, had to remind the waitress twice, then our starters arrived before the wine so asked for it to be taken away, then the wine was brought but had to wait for the food!! Again reminded the waitress and when the food did eventually arrive it was dried up from sitting under a grill! Had enough at this stage and decided to leave but was informed we had to pay for the wine even though we had one glass poured each. I contacted the hotel TWICE by email after this and got no response. Much better places in Belfast to eat and stay don‚Äôt waste your time here.",1,2018,08,18
226,"Great hotel, restaurant not so great","The location is central to the main attractions of Belfast, the rooms are tastefully decorated and pretty amazing. The staff are friendly and personable. The reason for the four stars rather than the five was that the restaurant food was underwhelming and overpriced. Restaurant aside, this is a really nice hotel, my suggestion would be to stay at the hotel but eat at one of the many excellent restaurants in the area.",4,2018,08,18
226,Birthday Trip! ,"Beautiful modern hotel in the heart of Belfast. Pure luxury from the minute you enter the hotel. Staff are helpful and friendly and made me feel so welcome. The rooms are spacious and beautifully decorated. The beds are comfortable and the added extras like an umbrella etc in the room where just so useful and handy. We went for the bed and breakfast option. The breakfast is held in the restuarant on the first floor, their is a buffet with cereals, breads, pastries, drinks, cheese/meats, fruit etc and then a hot breakfast menu. I went for the full breakfast and it was presently beautifully, not too much and not too little. The waiter staff were attentive and kept us topped up with warm toast and hot drinks, we could have sat as long as we'd liked and it was a lovely relaxed modern atmosphere. Would highly recommend! ",5,2018,08,18
226,Cheeky night away,Lovely surroundings staff very friendly and helpful. Food was delicious. Will definitely be back. Central location to city and motorway. Very relaxing atmosphere. Comfortable beds with lots of space to stretch and relax ,5,2018,08,16
226,Excellent hotel,"Hotel is fabulous. 

Rooms, hotel reception, restaurants ....all were lovely. Staff were very professional & very helpful. Rooms were tastefully decorated with lots of extra's. Hotel is in an excellent location close to the opera house and close to nice restaurants, bars etc. 

Hotel bar was lovely and food also excellent there too. 

Breakfast was gorgeous and staff were excellent too. 

Happy to recommend this hotel to all.",5,2018,08,15
226,Perfectly positioned and a top class hotel in every way !,"We thoroughly enjoyed our night here !  From the great welcome from Shannon on arrival this hotel was simply excellent from start to finish.

We were given a luxurious and really comfortable room, breakfast was outstanding and the cocktail bar in the evening absolutely excellent with great service, a nice atmosphere and an extremely high standard of cocktail making !

Perfectly situated, many of the main sights are very close by and Gerrard at concierge was really friendly and helpful with information and recommendations, as well as parking the hire car.

We can‚Äôt comment on the restaurant in the hotel in the evening as we didn‚Äôt eat in the hotel in the evening but given the high standards everywhere also in the hotel it would be a surprise if it was not nice.  We wanted to eat out though and, after a great recommendation from the hotel, went to The Ginger Bistro, one minute‚Äôs walk down the road and we could not recommend it higher - the food, service and atmosphere was simply sensational.",5,2018,08,15
226,Wonderful experience,"Second time we've stayed in this hotel this year.  Everything about it is 5 star; staff are excellent, so too is the food.  Attention to detail is excellent.  The hotel couldn't be in a better location for sightseeing. Can't wait to return!!",5,2018,08,15
226,Anniversary,"Had a great stay at the fitzwilliam,room was great size with a great shower and very clean,staff were really nice and helpful...we also had dinner at the restaurant which was beautiful,had a really good time and would definitely  go back.",5,2018,08,14
226,Very nice hotel,"You feel what you are welcome to this hotel. Very nice staff. Very good breakfaest, nice room. As a solo traveler you can feel safe. The hotel is very well locatet in the city it is very near shops, Culture and more. Irealy want to come back to this hotel.",5,2018,08,14

226,My recent stay,Wonderful stay and highly recommend this hotel.  The hotel has friendly staff that will assist in any need you have.  The hotel has great rooms and bathrooms that are very clean and spacious.  It's the perfect location to access restaurants and shopping.,5,2018,08,13
226,Luxury and spectacular service,"We stayed in 7 different hotels over our stay and this was one of the best. This hotel was beautiful, and in a great location. Our room was fancy, we ate dinner in the bar and the food was absolutely amazing. The bar manager was so helpful and offered suggestions on what we should see during our short time in Belfast. Breakfast was also of great quality. All staff was super pleasant and helpful.",5,2018,08,12
226,Excellent...100% deserved 5*,"I don't normally leave reviews but my stay here was perfect from start to finish. I came to Belfast for a gig which I got completely drenched at but within 5 minutes of being back in the hotel I was freshened up. Everything you could need and more in the room, comfy bed, amazing shower, bath, bathrobes, slippers, hair dryer and lots of glasses and tea. The staff were so helpful and nothing was too much trouble. My friend wanted Nutella at breakfast and there was none so they offered to melt chocolate chips, my friend said not to worry and then one of the waiters went out and bought some for her! Breakfast was out of this world and had every item you could possibly want with the only limit being your appetite. You 100% get what you pay for so if you are looking for a 5* in Belfast this is the one.",5,2018,08,12
226,Enjoyable stay,"Had a lovely stay at Ftizwilliam. Room was clean, beautiful and restful. Staff were friendly and helpful. Breakfast included left a lot to be desired if you are vegan and enjoy a cooked meal. Decaf coffee was also disappointing. Generally a good stay though and would recommend if you're not too fussed about breakfast.",4,2018,08,11
226,Hidden Gem,"Brilliant Hotel, Lovely Staff and very welcoming.  Enjoy our stay from start to finish. This was booked for our 50th Anniversary, along with dinner and then in to see Evita in the Opera House.  We arrived to find a lovely cake made for us in our room.  Lovely touch and these little tokens make all the difference",5,2018,08,10
226,One night stay,"Stayed one night with quick and efficient check in for Room 404. Rooms comfortable and well appointed. Despite previous reviews I have to say the sound proofing is perfectly acceptable. Staying in the center of any city, people cannot expect total silence! I will mention the rug in the room, which is a trip hazard and probably unnecessary (photo attached) and also the sofa which is really, really uncomfortable and rock hard... Bathroom has everything you need with large shower and bath, plenty of towels provided. Breakfast nice and staff very professional and courteous but a little interaction with guests and a smile would be appreciated. All in all a reasonable nights stay and wouldn't hesitate in recommending The Fitzwilliam to other travellers. ",4,2018,08,09
226,Very nice place,"It's a very nice place. The staff is kind and attentive. We would have liked to be asked if we minded to have a room for persons in wheelchair because the shower is opened, the facets are very low and there there were no shelves to put our clothes and personal items. Very good location!",4,2018,08,09
226,Afternoon Tea Experience,"On arrival the waiting staff didnt check our name for the reservation, we were offered water to start which was half a tumbler each, we had to ask for the tea at afternoon tea? We also had to ask for the cocktail(s) which came as part of the package then the sandwiches came out with butter when we had requested they didnt previously- so one member of the party received a dry chicken sandwich crust & all attached- NOT a selection the same as the rest of us only with no butter, disgrace! Nobody at any point came back to our table to ask if we needed anything else. We complained & only received a bill for 3 of us...to my disbelief they had charged us ¬£5.10 for half a tumbler of water each!!!! Where does the 10p come from in this pricing?? Never again will I return for afternoon tea or drinks here nor will I be recommending it!",1,2018,08,08
226,"Central location, welcoming staff and spacious rooms.","Really liked the central location, spacious and modern rooms and welcoming staff. This hotel ticks all the right boxes. Don't skip the rich and indulgent breakfast or visiting the bar for a night cap.",5,2018,08,08
226,Weekend Trip,"I am so happy I booked to stay here last weekend. It was completely 5 star treatment. 
All the little touches made the weekend extra special, from taking our bags out of our taxi on our early arrival and then advising they will be waiting in our room for us, I added a bottle of prosecco for my room and they provided a complimentary chocolate cake wishing my partner a happy birthday, the turn down service offered with the most delicious little chocolates. The staff were very attentive it is a fantastic hotel I will definitely be back.

226,Top hotel,"Stayed in March with my sister.  Check in smooth and issue free.  Very friendly receptionists and concierge.  We didn‚Äôt go straight to our room but when we did go to the room our cases had been delivered for us.  Plenty of choice of tea, coffee and milk.....no need to ask for extra.  Spotlessly clean and smelling fresh.  The bed was amazingly comfortable.  Bathroom was superb with gorgeous toiletries.  We had quite a few cocktails in the lounge bar and the staff were very helpful.  All in all a great stay and would definitely stay again.",5,2018,08,07
226,Forced to upgrade for reasonable comfort,We received outstanding service when we checked in until we got into our room and discovered it was accommodations for a wheelchair. Not terrible except the sink was very low to the ground. When we called to explain the mix up we were told that all rooms were like that unless you requested an upgrade. Since we were staying multiple nights we decided to take the ,3,2018,08,07
226,Weekend break,"I'm sorry to say but on our experience, I would not rate the hotel overall as a five star. Generally the staff were very friendly. However, in the bar, with one exception on Sat night, the bar staff were in attentive and poorly trained without it being particularly busy.
Breakfast on Sat morning was extremely poor. The full Irish was obviously not freshly cooked and had clearly been sitting under a lamp for quite a while. As a result, we cancelled Sunday breakfast.",3,2018,08,07
226,Luxury boutique hotel,"The Fitzwilliam is a luxury hotel and a great base for a weekend getaway in Belfast. We found comfortable, clean and well facilitated rooms. Very friendly staff and concierge are quick to advise. A menu service is available for breakfast and could not be faulted. Overall, was a 5 star experience.",5,2018,08,07
226,One word Luxury,"Best hotel in Belfast for rooms service and a great stay, Brian the bar manager is hard to beat. Book directly for a good deal nothing is too much trouble for the staff. location is ideal for trains and getting to the airport. ",5,2018,08,06
226,Really lovely stay,"Fantastic location, lovely rooms and great service. Concierges were brilliant with information...especially Phillip and Gerard!

Great breakfast and the dinner with 3 courses was great value and choices.",5,2018,08,06
226,Afternoon tea,"Beautiful afternoon yea with our mummy and my sisters for my mummys birthday. 
Really good value for money.
 Lovely spread and cocktail. 
Staff wete very friendly amd polite.
We had a brilliant time. 
Would highly recommend xx",5,2018,08,06
226,Nice hotel but customer service needs improvement,"What a shame. An otherwise enjoyable stay was seriously marred by a lack of response to an error by the hotel that led to a breach of personal privacy and - potentially - security. I stayed at this hotel for three nights last week.
On the first night I was woken up by what I thought was someone arriving late to the room next door. Imagine then my surprise to find a stranger in my room at 02:20 am. I am not sure whose surprise was greater.

I called Reception to find out what was going on, only to be told that there was a problem with the check-in system. No apology made.

Next morning, nothing was said to me by anyone connected with the hotel, until I mentioned it to the Reception staff when returning after my day‚Äôs work, only to receive the response, ‚Äúyes, I heard about that. Sorry, seems your room was probably not checked in properly so was still showing as available.‚Äù
No other contact from the hotel was received until checking out two days later, when I raised it again, only to be met with, ‚ÄúOh, I think the manager was supposed to call you.‚Äù
Things do go wrong in hotels and customer-facing businesses, but it is the way they are resolved, managed and prevented from recurring that means I may or may not return with my custom.
I do not post reviews such as this without giving the establishment the opportunity to address the issue at the time. However, within the remaining length of my stay there was ample opportunity for the management to contact me without me having to prompt staff for a response, and no assurance was given that this issue would not affect me or other guests in the future. 
Come on The Fitzwilliam, live up to your five star billing.",3,2018,08,06
226,Loved it,Absolutely fabulous hotel in the centre of town and very classy. Would highly recommend! Staff more than accommodating and very friendly. Couldn't have made our stay better! Danielle especially was amazing ,5,2018,08,06
226,Excellent boutique hotel,"Highly recommend this hotel.  Stayed in one of the new rooms that had just been refurbished.  Beautiful decor and very nicely appointed, and a reasonable size (by European standards).  The breakfasts are very nice (pre-booked with room), and include the cold buffet with hot items off the menu.  The service at the hotel has been impeccable from all levels of staff.  They are helpful, attentive and do everything they can to help you.  A special thank you to the concierge Gerard - who booked golf, theater tickets and restaurants for us.",5,2018,08,06
226,Absolutely 5* Hotel,"We stayed here for two nights and had a wonderful experience. We arrived and were checked in by Ashleigh who was very helpful with advice and guidance regarding things to do and see in the city.
The location is perfect- you can walk to most areas within the city with ease. There are lots of restaurants and pubs very close; the Cathedral Quarter is very close and you are right beside the Opera House.
Our room was beautiful with plush furnishings, a very comfortable bed and everything I imagine you could want. The turn down service was a lovely surprise and the chocolates which accompanied it delicious!
We ate and drank in the hotel bar the first night we were there and thoroughly enjoyed the food. Service was excellent, very friendly but not over-bearing, and the cocktails very good.
We used taxi's every day and these were arranged by reception, always prompt, reasonably priced and lovely drivers with a good ""craic"" every time.
Definitely 5* surroundings, service, food and drinks. I would love to return if I get a chance to come back to Belfast.",5,2018,08,05
226,Fitzy,"No hesitation to give 5 stars for location, reception area, room service, restaurant & staff. 
I‚Äôm glad I chose to stay here, I felt welcomed. The staff is kind and pro, I liked the design of the reception area and also in the room, where Ionela made a good cleaning. 
Whatever you do, don‚Äôt skip their breakfast, good taste and nice restaurant. 
It‚Äôs fitzy! 

",5,2018,08,05
226,Luxury and Style,"Steps from the famous Crown Pub, this hotel has a stylish fit-out and design that reminds me a little of the excellent Blythswood Hotel in Glasgow. The quality of interiors here is top of the range. Luggage is professionally and efficiently dealt with (a refreshing change). Beautifully designed lobby area.with vaulted ceiling. The bar was a little dark for my taste but I happily managed some food there in quick time with service that was so polite it was a bit much! 
Room was lush with a marvellously comfortable super king bed and a luxury bathroom. Silent air conditioning  (yes I know that‚Äôs hard to believe), robes etc and a beautiful marble top desk. We left early so I ordered the continental breakfast in the room which was delicious. Top class experience and highly recommended. ",5,2018,08,05
226,Good but no cigar (pool),"We loved our stay and the rooms are fancy and luxurious, blush and marble make you feel like you're in a L'Oreal ad. The 5 star rating and no pool just don't match in my head so very disappointed there. ",4,2018,08,04
226,Disappointing service,"Tried to buy a gift voucher for an anniversary present; five days after I received confirmation of purchase and informed that the voucher would be posted to the recipient, I was contacted and told my card had been declined. There was no reason for this and I was disappointed that I hadn't been contacted sooner, as I hoped that the voucher would arrive in time for the anniversary, which was six days after purchase. Little help was offered on the telephone and the attitude was rather lassez-fair. Disappointing for a hotel of such supposedly high calibre. ",1,2018,08,03
226,Our choice in Belfast,"We had a recent stay in Belfast at the Fitzwilliam while we visited the other half's family. The staff on both check in and check out were fantastic, knowledgeable, helpful and wonderfully friendly without it seeming at all forced or 'customer service-y' in short the staff were just genuinely nice people. 

The hotel itself is really well located and well appointed, the rooms likewise were well sized, immaculately clean with a generous bathroom. We were really pleased with our room and though Belfast can get a touch rowdy on a sunny weekend with all the stag and hen parties (particularly those strange bike tours) we felt reasonably well insulated from the noise whilst still effectively looking out over the city.

The bar (albeit pricey) offers excellent drinks though we didn't sample any food we did enjoy the chocolates on turndown. We'll definitely be back, in fact it will always be our first choice when visiting Belfast.",5,2018,08,02
226,Highly Recommend!,"Stayed here with my girlfriend on the 29/7/18 and we both absolutely loved it! Great location, highly efficient and friendly staff and the room was super. Would recommend to anyone, and will definitely be back. Special mention to Peter who looked after us with a few drinks in the lobby after we came back in at night, he was very busy but still stopped for a chat and was very welcoming. Was actually unnecessarily apologetic he couldn‚Äôt stay and talk for longer as he had lots of work to do, just shows how friendly everyone is! 100% be back. ",5,2018,08,02
226,Luxury at its finest,"This hotel is absolutely stunning. The staff, rooms,, atmosphere and decor are second to none. Have tried and failed to find another hotel like it in the country. Would return to Belfast just to stay here again.Cannot recommend them enough. ",5,2018,08,02
226,OK stay.,Several issues but we were asked twice to leave the room by staff before our 2pm check out and them they acted oblivious to it. Room was lovely and to a good standard but overall compared to other 5star hotels this didnt measure up. ,3,2018,07,31
226,Luxurious,"First time visiting Belfast ,the hotel is in a great location at the see of the opera house the city hall is just down the road we found it a fantastic base for exploring the city,the red bus tours office is jus across the road where you can book the titanic museum, bus,giants causeway trips",5,2018,07,31
226,One night stay,"Clean and nicely updated. The staff are extremely friendly and helpful and the hotel is right in the middle of downtown close to everything. We didn't have dinner there but breakfast was good, we had to catch a flight early and the staff made sure we were in and out quickly.",4,2018,07,31
226,Amazing,"We could not fault the hotel or the staff in any way, everyone was smart, cheerful, efficient and friendly. We had a superior room, it was comfortable, luxurious and chic. We had dinner on one evening, the food was beautifully prepared and served, this is truly a five star hotel with five star staff.",5,2018,07,28
226,Leisure stay,"Fantastic friendly staff , exceptionally well looked after and food delicious.  Very comfortable and spacious bedroom , great to have both bath and shower, coping with speed and relaxation.  The location very convenient  from all aspects, easy walk to Titanic Exhibition.",5,2018,07,28
226,Elegant and Central,"Very welcoming, efficient and informative on arrival.
It was a quick check in which we appreciate.
We took drinks in the bar and then retired to our room and had room service. Room was clean and well appointed. Tv, tea and coffee, king size bed, writing facilities, iron, great shower in a good sized bathroom.
We ordered the carder salad and pizza from the room service menu and they were excellent.
We took breakfast in the restaurant which was again very welcoming. They offer a continental buffet or a menu of choice; we had omelette and eggs benedict both were excellent.
The hotel was very close to the starting point for our organised coach trip of the Antrim coast and giants causeway which was a happy coincidence!
City centre shops are only a few minutes walk away as are the bars!
All in all it was a lovely stay and we will be back
",5,2018,07,27
226,"Nice, but never 5-Star","I stayed at the Fitzwilliam twice this year, January & again in March.  

Staff are very friendly, rooms are comfortable enough and the breakfast is nice enough.  But there is no way this is a 5-star hotel.  

I've stayed in Harvey's Point in Donegal, which is a 4-star hotel and it is much more luxurious than the Fitzwilliam.  

The Galgorm is 5-star, the Lough Erne Golf Resort is 5-star.  The Fitzwilliam is really only good enough to be 3-star.

That all being said, it is excellently located in the City centre, which is a real plus, as you are within walking distance from most places of interest.

Would definitely go back IF it wasn't as expensive, as you are paying a 5-star price, but it just doesn't live up to that tag.",3,2018,07,26
226,Belfast City Luxury,"I don't think we've ever been greeted so warmly by a hotel staff. The Concierge team are by far the best we've ever experienced. Philip is so knowledgable of everything Belfast and all of Northern Ireland. They went over and above to help us plan great things to see and do while visiting. If your in need of a private taxi tour, request Jim O'Neill. ",5,2018,07,26
226,Great location but expected More from a 5 star!!!,"Booked an Executive King but would have expected a bigger room with a better view. Room facilities were good, bed was comfortable and the bathroom was specifically well appointed.

My wife and I had dinner in the restaurant and would definitely not eat there again. The food was of average quality with the dessert being especially poor and the decor was off putting.

All the staff we encountered were friendly and attentive",4,2018,07,25
226,Superb stay,"A first class weekend with first class service. Nothing was too much trouble. All staff without exception were friendly and polite and went the extra mile to make our stay a memorable one. Little touches like chocolates on the pillow made it extra special. The room was spacious, comfortable and clean and the vast choice of breakfast did not detract from the quality. TIL the next time Fitzwilliam......and thank you very much x",5,2018,07,24
226,100% Recommended. A sure bet.,"The Hotel is perfectly located and is tye best you can find in Belfast. The rooms are very nice, quiet and  you can sleep great. The staff is one of the best 5*GL I have ever seen. The concierges would solve any problem you have, specially Liam that is always with a smile and helps in every way. Also, great service at the bar, drinks and food and special attention from the manager, James O‚ÄôDonnell, we were so impressed we wrote the name! This is a sure bet. If you are going to Belfast, stay here, don't think it twice.",5,2018,07,24
226,Pure Class!  Recently renovated and full service!,"We very much enjoyed our recent stay at the Fitzwilliam largely due to the staff and beautiful new rooms on the 9th floor.  We did have one issue that the hotel will hopefully take care of, and that is loose marble slabs on top of the furniture which can fall off and break your feet.  Other than that, a perfectly wonderful stay. ",5,2018,07,24
226,very good hotel,"very friendly people, very helpful staff when we arrived, good service throughout the hotel, good breakfast and dinner. perfect location. we would reccommend this hotel to anyone who wants to visit belfast.",5,2018,07,24
226,Nice place to stay,"Hotel was clean and staff was very friendly. Location is excellent, we were able to walk everywhere. A few of the people in our party thought the noise on the floor being remodeled started too early, seemed like the banging started before 8am, but I didn't experience that as I was not staying on the floor just below the construction. The girl who checked me out was wonderful, I needed to print my boarding pass and she was able to help me. This was my first time in Belfast and I would definitely stay there again.",4,2018,07,23
226,So British.... old school Romantic,"I love this hotel I have been there several times and the personal is always customer oriented. The decorations is so lovely and intends to be so old schools, you can easily imagine you are at the time of Lord and Ladies. Their lobby decoration is so lovely and romantic. Around Christmas times you feel being part of a real postcard, fully enlightened & warm.
",4,2018,07,22
226,Service !!!!,"I stayed twice on this trip. This review is for the second stay which was brief, Both were business events. Second stay was MUCH better!! Thank you to the housekeeper who offerred to make my bed comfy. When does that ever happen these days?? I slept like a baby... Thank you!! I almost changed my hotel. I am VERY happy that I did not..",5,2018,07,22
226,Best of the best,"A beautiful modern / contemporary hotel that is truly a special place.  Small town feel with world class service.  The staff is courteous, knowledgeable, and will do anything above and beyond to accommodate every request.  Phillip and team up front are always on par and Beth has my never let me down! I will sleep on the street before I stay anywhere else in Belfast.
",5,2018,07,20
226,Beautiful hotel and amazing staff..,"I recently stayed in the hotel while on a midweek break with some friends up north. From the moment we arrived we were treated exceptional well.  All staff members were extremely helpful with special mention for Beth who served us in the bar and also gave us a detailed rundown of the best places to go while we enjoyed some delicious afternoon cocktails! 

The rooms are immaculate and extremely comfortable.  Facilities included a proper steam iron, coffee machine and GHD hair dryer - AMAZING!!",4,2018,07,19
226,Amazing staff offering a great service!,Very impressed with the staff and service. From arrival I was greeted with professionalism and smiles. After a long day with business engagements this was the tonic that meant I could really relax...... A true five star experience.,5,2018,07,19
226,Wonderful stay,"The was the last stop on our Irish trip, and we couldn't have chosen a better hotel to finish the experience. A real 5-star, in my opinion. Design, comfort, staff, everything was spot on. It was modern, but very comfortable. Fantastic bed, great bathroom with walk-in shower. Valet parking was great.
We had afternoon tea as well, which we enjoyed very much. Philip, the concierge was very helpful. Breakfast the next morning was also excellent (shame I wasn't hungry at all).
Really enjoyed our stay and would happily return if ever I go back to Belfast.",5,2018,07,17
226,Just perfect,"Stayed here for my birthday weekend on 13th July.
Check-in was great, nice cheery staff!
Stayed in an executive room which was perfect for what I was looking for.  All the little extras made my birthday weekend even more special.
Breakfast was fantastic too, and again lovely cheery staff.
Nothing was too much trouble, loved the fact that you were given an umbrella for the showers on the sunday afternoon of our stay even although we had checked out.",5,2018,07,17
226,Great hotel with great staff!,"Had a great stay here, very comfortable with great people. Victoria and Beth in the bar were very kind, fun, and answered any questions we had. The hotel itself was also very nice and located in a great spot in the center of everything. ",5,2018,07,17
226,Beautiful hotel in the heart of the city centre,We visited the Fitzwilliiam as we had been gifted a voucher for the hotel. We arrived in our car hoping to park in the hotel's car park but we were informed that it was fully booked for the night and an alternative car park was recommended just across the road which was no problem. We were upgraded to a beautiful corner room with floor to ceiling windows due to a very slight mix up which was extremely appreciated on the day. The rooms themselves are beautiful and offered a great view of the city. The staff in the hotel were all extremely friendly and chatty and answered any questions that we had. I would definitely recommend staying here if you are visiting Belfast and make sure to book the car park in advance of your arrival.,4,2018,07,16
226,Central modern hotel with warm welcome,"Service excellent, personal touch, rooms luxurious & modern. Enjoyed our stay, warm welcome in central location. Would stay here again, quiet weekend in Belfast city centre mad up for by good hotel stay",4,2018,07,16
226,Nice hotel with great staff,"We spent 3 nights at the Fitzwilliam Hotel for our wedding anniversary weekend.  We enjoyed our stay but what made the most impact on us was the staff - we have travelled a lot but pretty much every member of staff were extremely professional, friendly and made us feel very welcome.  They are a real credit to the hotel.

The location was great and close to most of the sights. Would stay here again if I return to Belfast.",4,2018,07,15
226,"How the magnificent Fitzwilliam saved us from a ""Merchant mistake""!","After being traumatised by our awful night stay at the Merchant Hotel, we have decided to cut our week-end short and go back home! At,The Merchant we spent all night awake with thumping disco music, drunken people banging our door, fighting with screaming party goers and ultimately our romantic city retreat became a nightmare! We left the Merchant at 6 am swearing never again to believe in false publicity. Worst stay of my life!
My Husband and I travel 2-3 times a year to Belfast from Dublin, to enjoy short week-ends away. We love Belfast vibrant energy, the troubled but fascinating history, the deep cultural vibes, magnificent food,restaurants, hotels & welcoming people.
Hotels are an integrant part of our trips around the world & short breaks!
This is the 2nd time we stay at the Fitzwilliam. I never felt at home in a Hotel as I feel here.After leaving the Merchant in hurry and sleep deprived, we finally found our peace & quite, positive vibes, and lovely helpful staff as we checked in immediately here.
The service is outstanding by every single staff members. From the moment of arrival with your car, a concierge will welcome you with 5 start professionalism and a friendly twist. 
The staff are superb and they will do anything to welcome you home while making you feel a ""special guest"" at all the time without false pretences. This is pure genuine customer service at the top of his level.
This hotel is the embodiment of what a 5 Star should be; wonderful staff, refined style, luxury, superb customer care, beautiful rooms, relaxing, modern & clean, wonderful atmosphere, best location....a gym for me!  
We have stayed to the top Hotels in Belfast and this is by far the best you will stay!
You won't find a better set-up with the perfect balance between customer service, modern infrastructure, location. 
The staff once again, were wonderful to us after our terrible stay at the Merchant.
We won't be making the same mistake again in the future by staying somewhere  else. They helped us to recover our broken week-end and ultimately it was just amazing!
It will always be The Fitzwilliam all the way for us!
Thank you guys
Valentina & Darragh",5,2018,07,14
226,Belfast stay,Had a really enjoyable stay would definitely stay at the fitzwilliam hotel again the staff and the rooms were both excellent.The location was exactly were we would have chosen it to be and it was close to nightlife.,5,2018,07,14
226,Great hotel,"We were greeted on arrival and our car was taken care off. Front of house staff were great and friendly. We had booked a city view room, but looking out onto building works, however we called down and asked if there were any rooms looking into great Victoria street. Very quickly we were upgraded to an executive room which was amazing! Thank you so much for a lovely treat for our wedding anniversary. 
The only downfall was the restaurant, maybe some additional training for staff members and additional choices for the set menu! ",5,2018,07,14
226,1 night stay for anniversary....,"Living 30 minutes away from Belfast we don‚Äôt react stay over, but on the 2 occasions we‚Äôve decided to tear ourselves we‚Äôve picked The Fitzwilliam and have loved it! 

It would be one of the pricier hotels but is really worth it, the hotel itself and rooms have had a bit of a revamp since we last went and they‚Äôre really gorgeous. 

We stayed in a double room, check in was easy with very nice staff behind the desk. The room was perfect, love the colour schemes in the decor, they had the air con on (we‚Äôre having an unexpected heatwave) and music playing for us coming in. 

We had a few cocktails in the bar, again the service from staff and drinks were great. They had a singer/guitarist on which was nice to have a bit of atmosphere. 

When we arrived back to our room that evening they‚Äôd turned down the bed, left chocolates on the pillows and fresh bottled water on the bedside tables! 

I never sleep well in hotels, always waking up very early! Both times we‚Äôve stayed here I‚Äôve slept like a baby! The beds are so comfy and the curtains make the complete pitch black. We couldn‚Äôt believe the time when we woke up! 

We will 100% visit again and would recommend to others whether visiting Belfast on holiday or treating yourself to a stay-cation ",5,2018,07,14
226,So nearly a Relaxing weekend ,"We stayed here Saturday to Tuesday. Great location near the famous Crown pub, public transport hubs and shops.

Very good service when arrived, room was lovely, clean and modern although not sure why there was an old hi fi in the cupboard.

Belfast is a great town for a party so you would hope for a lie in Sunday morning, not here.  The hotel had workmen banging away putting up scaffold at 8am and then there was drilling throughout the day which reverberated through the room making it impossible to relax.  Maybe Monday would be a reprieve....no, it started at 7am.  I think therefore 3 stars in my review is very generous.  So if you want a decent hotel, but don‚Äôt want to rest during the day or sleep in past 7 am during the week or 8am at weekends this is the place....not for me though",3,2018,07,13
226,To the amazing angel who found our Mastercard!,"Romantic stay in a gorgeous room with beautiful decor, including a sumptuous breakfast.... unfortunately we misplaced our Mastercard on the day we were to leave Northern Ireland... The amazing staff here weaved their magic and were able to find it for us... !!!!   Pure relief... Can't thank you enough",5,2018,07,13
226,Superb room......disappointing breakfast,"Perfectly appointed, The Fitzwilliam is a smart and modern hotel. Standard double room is very big and spacious bathroom. Lovely attention to detail - chocolates on pillow every night, turn-down service with dressing gowns, candle in a glass by the side of the bath. Very comfortable mattress, good selection of tea/coffee etc. We were very happy to spend time in the room.
Breakfast was a disappointment - all very dry, over cooked bacon and poached eggs, not a baked bean in sight! If I‚Äôd paid ¬£20, I would ha e felt cheated.",4,2018,07,13
226,Excellent staff,Staff are very professional and efficient and the bedrooms are modern. The only comment I would have is on the restaurant and bar which is a little dated and bland. I will return and would certainly recommend to others.  ,5,2018,07,12
226,"Quality, Comfort and Excellent Location","This is the second time I have stayed at this hotel and both occasions have been excellent. It is a quality hotel, with friendly staff and a great location with easy access to all that Belfast City has to offer.",5,2018,07,12
226,Over-Rated; Not 5 Star,"The Fitzwilliam is centrally located in Belfast right next to the Opera House and within walking distance to all of downtown and most sites except need for a taxi to Titanic and Botanic Gardens.  Please note that this is not 5 Star. Check-in employees at desk and concierges were efficient and pleasant and in general were knowledgeable about directions and restaurants.  Breakfast was good but not at the level of 5 star hotels we stayed at in Cork and Killarney. We had problem with the special royal wedding high tea that they were touting with posted flyers.  On Friday we were told that the time we wanted wasn‚Äôt available.  The next morning we were told it was now available.  When we arrived there was nobody in the room.  There was one large table set for a family with a few young noisy children.  We asked to sit in the larger room. That was empty and closed.  Not very exciting.  We left.  How could the tea have been booked when we first asked? Room 712 at over 200¬£ was adequate, not 5 star; no dresser ‚Äì [do hotel room designers ever stay in a hotel room?], one has to search for outlets to charge one‚Äôs electrical devices ‚Äì hey, it‚Äôs 2018. The safe in the closet was so low that one had to get on one‚Äôs knees to use it.  We had a leak from the bottom of the shower door onto the tiled floor. Maintenance came up while we were out and it became worse. Threw towels on it and decided to let next guests deal with it as we didn‚Äôt want maintenance in room constantly.  My average rating is based on location and lobby concierges, but should be lower based on price paid.",3,2018,07,11
226,Amazing Service!,"Love this hotel! Phillip, James and the entire front desk and concierge staff are amazing! Recommendations for food and sightseeing we‚Äôre on point! These guys can get you anything you need! Room was very nice and location is great. I would stay here again anytime. These guys are pros and could not be friendlier!
",5,2018,07,11
226,Girly weekend break ,"I visited the Fitzwilliam last weekend with 19 of my friends.  It was the first time many of my friends had visited Belfast and they were not disappointed. We had a wonderful weekend and the staff at the Fitzwilliam contributed to that wonderful weekend.  They were helpful, friendly and couldn‚Äôt do enough for us.  I would definitely return to this hotel and would highly recommend it to anyone else. ",5,2018,07,10
226,Doesn‚Äôt live up to the billing,This is a good hotel but is not a 5 star hotel. If all functions within the hotel operated as well as reception / concierge this review would be wholly different. These guys were excellent. However finding a SAFE electrical socket in the room to use the supplied kettle was a real challenge. The availability of a wide selection of food stuff during the later stages of breakfast was challenging eg later smoothies and fruit pots are not available and there are inconsistencies on how food is delivered. However the standard of the food was consistently good. There was even a reluctance to leave a jug of water on the table when requested  ,3,2018,07,10
226,Great pub food,We stopped in just before the kitchen closed up for the night. The servers were efficient and friendly. The beer was great! I had the bangers and mash it was good. The wife had fish and chips. The batter was a bit mushy but the chips were great. We stayed for a couple of pints after. Great live music!,4,2018,07,09
226,Beautiful hotel,Lovely stay in Belfast. Top notch rooms and very friendly staff. Luxurious accommodations. My so loved the bathrobes! Definitely recommend this hotel as it is so centrally located and convenient to the city.,5,2018,07,09
226,Absolute gem of a hotel right in the heart of Belfast! ,"We stayed for 2 nights for my graduation and the service was amazing from the start! Staff were so friendly and couldn‚Äôt do enough for us. Rooms are beautiful although it was a little smaller than I expected but it wasn‚Äôt too small, none the less absolutely stunning! I contacted the hotel before we stayed as I had read reviews about noise from construction across the street, they were so attentive and made sure we had a room that wouldn‚Äôt be disturbed by noise. We were able to check in at 1pm too which was great! We didn‚Äôt have breakfast at the hotel so I can‚Äôt really comment on that, we just went to cafes next to the hotel for breakfast. Great location, absolute gem of a hotel right in the heart of belfast! ",5,2018,07,08
226,Very noisy stay,"This is a very nice hotel. The rooms are very well furnished and comfy and the staff are very polite. The location is very convenient for city centre excursions and a train station nearby. 

However, our stay was really ruined by the amount of noise in the morning, seemingly made by builders on the floor above or below us. The noise (which sounded like drilling) began early in the morning and continued for hours, and was still going on when we left the room at 12pm. Totally unacceptable levels of noise especially for the morning time. If a guest had been guilty of this amount of noise they would have been asked to leave. 

Ruined what would have been an otherwise excellent stay, had I been staying for more than one night it would have been a major issue. ",2,2018,07,08

226,Beautiful hotel in a perfect location,"We got a corner suite with a gorgeous view for 2 nights. Classical music greeted us when we would return home. The bathroom was massive with both a shower stall and separate tub. The bed was very comfortable. Service in the lounge was very attentive and professional with a great selection of hand crafted cocktails. The concierge also made arrangements for a black taxi tour before we headed back to Dublin and we got a great recommendation to get an Ulster fry at the Harlem cafe nearby. The location was perfect and within short walking distance of the Crown saloon, the main shopping area and Donegall square. I‚Äôd love to stay here again!",4,2018,07,03

Would recommend",5,2018,07,02
226,Beautiful hotel in a great location,"Staying with my siblings on a visit to Belfast & really enjoyed this hotel. Beautiful foyer, modern rooms, lovely bar & excellent service. Great central location. Food was very good but I wasn't keen on the restaurant style as seating was in a booth style & didn't seem as luxurious as the rest of the hotel. Staff were very attentive & I'd definitely recommend it as a lovely experience overall. ",5,2018,07,02
226,"Very comfortable hotel, doubt any hotel significantly better in Belfast","Comfortable, quiet, clean, efficient staff and good location (we walked everywhere from it).

Liam at concierge is very helpful and goes above and beyond to make sure that you are well taken care of and is always on hand to help or answer any questions.

We will definitely be back.

",5,2018,06,28
226,Hen Party,The actual hotel and rooms are lovely. From a hen party perspective I would suggest moving the cocktail making to a private room as I found it a bit awkward making cocktails in the bar where families were having lunch. It meant we couldn't really enjoy ourselves as we had to be respectful of the families sharing the room with us. Also I wouldn't describe the food as being 4*. I found the food quiet bland for a vegetarian. I can't speak for the main menu.,3,2018,06,27
226,Wedding,"Stayed here the night before our wedding. Treated brilliantly from start to finish and it really added to our special day.

They offered if I wanted any 'extras' e.g. champs/rose petals, all the romantic details lol! Upon arrival staff were so lovely and welcoming, honestly they made us feel at home when we walked through the door! Door/reception staff 10/10, we were directed to our room and it was beautiful! However, I had paid almost ¬£200 for one night and there were stains on the carpet/walls and chips of wood out of our desk. Not a big deal AT ALL! Didn't change my experience at all, just would've liked our room to reflect the price i'd paid! We headed out for the night and when we returned back to our room, staff had been in and left chocolates on our bed. Another fab wee touch. Brill hotel but the staff make it so good, not the finish of the room!!",4,2018,06,25
226,Clean and Comfortable,"Stayed for 2 nights. Great location in the City Centre. Despite reviews of construction noises, we never heard anything in our room. We were on the 4th floor. Only con is the parking situation - wish there was  valet service.",4,2018,06,23
226,Customer Service,"Hi, I am writing to commend the customer service given by a staff member of your called Shannon Wire.

226,City break ,"On the recommendation of a friend, my wife and I booked this hotel for a brief visit to Belfast. We were not disappointed. We stayed in a junior suite on a corner. The room was very comfortable, with floor to ceiling windows giving us a great view of the city below us. All of the staff very attentive and polite. I had asked for flowers to be placed in the room as it was my wife‚Äôs birthday - the hotel added some welcome macaroons and a card for her, which were nice touches. Breakfast was very enjoyable, with all of the usual options available. We also ate at the hotel and the dinner menu was extensive and tasty. This is a great hotel and is unreservedly recommended for anyone wishing to visit this lovely and very friendly city. 5 stars (and I would give more if I could, especially for the staff).",5,2018,06,22

226,Overated hotel.,"Booked 2 twin executive rooms. When we checked in we had been given 1 twin and a double. My 2 sons had got the double? Luckily my wife and I  where able to swap them for the double and give them the twin room.
We had room 216 which is next door to room services.So from early morning the door is banging so don't expect a nice quiet lie in. Room services use the corridor outside room 216 as a car park for there trollys. At one point we had 3 parked up blocking the corridor . Good job we didn't have a fire?
We didn't use any of the hotel facilities so I can't comment on them.
We checked out on fri am and where told everything was paid for and we had nothing to pay.
Yet a ¬£300 charge to my wifes credit card? Have contacted the hotel for an explanation.",3,2018,06,18

Staff was friendly and helpful. Overall, the hotel was nice and we will definitely be back. ",5,2018,06,17
226,Fantastic place to stay,"We stayed here for one night. A deal which included a four course dinner and breakfast.
Our room was a corner room which had a great view over Belfast and a view on the Giants face, or some call it Napoleon's nose.
The staff was friendly and helpful. Service minded. That's a great feature for a 5* hotel. 
The room was comfortable and had everything you needed.

About 10 mins walk away from the city centre. Good location. ",4,2018,06,15
226,Two nights stay,The room we stayed in was excellent.   The dinner was extremely disappointing.  We had the set menu at ¬£25 per person.  Very average.  Weren't allowed a bread roll with the set dinner.  Breakfast was very average not up to 5 star hotel standard.  Unfortunately they are in the process of building a penthouse on the roof and the noise was dreadful and didn't stop until 10p.m.  We did complain and were given a small discount.  I think guests should be warned in advance.  Overall not a good experience.,3,2018,06,15
226,Excellent Service,"stayed for 1 night in this hotel but wish it had been longer. The room was very spacious and comfortable and great value for the standard of hotel. When I first checked in I had a question about the room and the concierge Gerald could not have been more friendly. I really appreciated his assistance and he gave me a small tour of the hotel which was lovely.
We had delicious cocktails in the bar and we had a lovely meal in the restaurant. When leaving Gerald the concierge was so nice helping me to our car with all my shopping. would come back again but stay for longer as one night isn't long enough.",5,2018,06,14
226,"Great Hotel, but noisy.","Hotel on all fronts is excellent, staff very helpful and informative for any questions you may have. Noise is an issue, due to the building work which is takingplace internally and externally. Very Difficult to have a lie in.",4,2018,06,13

226,Should have been warned about the construction!,"First impressions were grand would have liked a room looking out on to main street, but alas I did not request...........so we had a room overlooking a building going up on the other side, so hammering began at 0715 hours on Saturday morning I could have easily killed them.........not good... we went for peace and quiet.  Was on a room only night, so cannot comment on breakfast nor did I go into the bar.........happy to find the tea coffee etc behind the mirrored door nice touch......... nicely centralized hotel for visitors to Belfast..........",3,2018,06,11
226,Excelleny,"Very comfy , centrally located. Particularly happy with the advice from concierge called Gerard- thank you - made such a difference to our trip! 
Other concierge, who cane on after 3pm, unfortunately had an attitude that was dismissive and disinterested. 
Room was executive and bootle of bubbles and strawberries and cream was lovely to receive on arrival. ",4,2018,06,11
226,Fab hotel -great location! ,"We had such a wonderful stay in this hotel last weekend. The staff were so helpful and friendly and the hotel was beautiful. We had an executive king room, and it was fab, lovely large room, with king bed, couch, bathroom with shower and bath and mini bar. 

We went for evening drinks in perch and dinner in James st. South, both within a 3 minute walk from the hotel and about 10 minutes from the hotel. 

Valet parking available for ¬£20, and we were able to leave the car until 2 the following day (subject to availability). I would recommend that you book in for parking as I believe there isn‚Äôt that many spaces. 

Would highly recommend commend this hotel and we will definitely return. ",5,2018,06,11
226,Disappointing,"¬£187 for Sunday night dinner, bed and breakfast package seeking some rest and relaxation.

Room well appointed and made good use of the space.

Location is excellent.

Restaurant was a bit disappointing. Starter of crab cake was quite tasteless. Rump steak for main was incredibly fatty and at times impossible to chew. No steak knife provided. The saving grace was the sticky toffee pudding for dessert. Got charged ¬£5 to have water with our meal though!!!!

Our main issue was being sold a room with construction ongoing on the same floor, particularly as this package is sold as a late check out designed for those seeking a lie-in.  Rudely awakened from our long sought after rest, by workmen banging and drilling from 9am.

Complained to reception, who just said ‚Äúsorry about that‚Äù. No attempt made to compensate for our lost sleep.

Won‚Äôt be back!!",2,2018,06,11

226,Could be great ,"This place blew us away, the service was great the first day, it was brilliant to know that staff remembered your name. What let it down for me was the bar, it was not comfy, and you could hardly fit into the booths, and breakfast was a real disappointment, food was great but service was run by teenagers who were too busy flirting with each other that worry about looking after their customers. We had to ask twice and wait 20 min for our coffee. ",3,2018,06,06

Checking out no problem quick and simple",4,2018,05,30
226,Disappointing,"We had a signature king and it was ok, a bit underwhelming for the price. We had a view of some bins and discarded bits of furniture which wasn't very pleasant. Check in and check out staff were lovely but the staff in the restaurant for breakfast weren't that great, one woman in particular looked in a really bad mood and was very short with anyone who spoke to her. The breakfast was mediocre at best, i suspect the avocado on my toast came out of a jar. The most annoying thing was that when I paid my bill on check out they did not release the hold for the same amount on my card and still haven't for days later. I've stayed in another well known five star in the city centre recently which was actually ¬£55 cheaper and far superior. I'd recommend giving this one a miss.",3,2018,05,30

226,"NOT a five star hotel, barely a three star","This hotel is not even close to five star category as they prominently advertise. Five star means luxury and quality such that you would receive at a Ritz Carlton or the like. This hotel has NONE of that. My room was dingy, depressing and outdated. The television was small and sitting on top a card table. It only had local stations. No CNN or CNBC. See picture. The couch had no cushions l it was wood with a decorative cloth covering stapled on it. When I plopped myself down on it I hurt my back. It was hard wood covered in cloth. Can you believe that? The telephones were dial type which became extinct 20 years ago. Not touch tone. The electrical outlets were only 220 v three prong type. No 110 v or USB outlets. There was no refrigerator, mini bar or complementary bottled water. The light switches were located all over the room and difficult to figure out. My room safe was locked open which should have been obvious to whomever prepared my room . The bedding was nothing special. Five star is the quality of a Ritz Carlton, the Peninsula, Regis, etc. The Fitzwilliam did not come close. It would have s hard time keeping up with a Holiday Inn. I feel I was scammed by this hotel relying on their five star designation and for that reason I am not recommending it. If I were to judge it based on a three star rating, I would say it is adequate, has a nice breakfast, and is centrally located, the internet worked and the staff was very pleasant. I would never stay there again.",1,2018,05,29
226,Wow 5 star is not enough,"What can I say, from arrival to departure this hotel is worth it‚Äôs 5star status. Check in was so efficient we were in our room within 10 minutes. Executive room is amazing, space, luxury but cozy for wife and I üëç. Breakfast was as expected and hostess could not do enough for us over the weekend. 
Detail to attention is everything here and I cannot fault in any way. Cannot wait to return in a couple of months.",5,2018,05,28
226,"Fantastic Place to Stay in Belfast, Ireland","My wife and I had an awesome, unforgettable and wonderful time staying at the Fitzwilliam Hotel in Belfast.  The staff, our room, the restaurant food and service were superb!!!!!   We would not hesitate to stay here whenever we visit Belfast again.  Fantastic service and staff from top to bottom.",5,2018,05,28
226,Amazing Hotel,Everything was so perfect.  I truly recommend this hotel. Dinner was amazing and so was breakfast well worth the money. The rooms were clean and comfortable and the staff real friendly and professional.,5,2018,05,27
226,Exceptionally Nice,"This is a very nice hotel in ‚ÄúCity Center‚Äù Belfast.  The staff was very friendly and the concierge exceptionally helpful.  The rooms were well appointed.  A lot of things you would desire to do in Belfast are within walking distance (Titanic museum, tour stops, pubs and restaurants).",5,2018,05,26
226,A plush experience!,"The hotel does excellence and makes it seem effortless to boot! Check-in was very efficient yet polite and friendly. I stayed in an executive suite room which was well appointed, comfortable and spacious. The bar staff can also make a mean cocktail!

Breakfast was excellent. I treated myself to a freshly made three egg omelette every day, and the continental fare was varied and well prepared.

I did have an issue with the thermostat on the last night as it wasn't working properly in my room. Based on the rest of my stay though, I believe this is something that they would fix as soon as they were informed there was a problem.

This is a centrally located hotel with a healthy dose of class and quality thrown in. Highly recommended!",5,2018,05,25
226,Comfortable and luxurious stay,Greeted by friendly staff on arrival and guided through process well.Great Service and clean rooms. Have been there on business trip for a short stay. Breakfast was very good and well served. . Highly recommend this place,5,2018,05,25
226,Absolutely amazing,"Extremely well decorated, every touch thought of, beds turned down, chocolates on pillows, prosecco in room. Just fantastic. The hotel gym was a bit basic and could use some further space and machines but other than that, no complaints at all!! ",5,2018,05,23
226,Excellent,"Excellent hotel. The staff made our stay very enjoyable and went beyond the call of service. Took my laundry on an off day, sent it out and had it returned that evening. Location of hotel was an easy walking distance for shopping sightseeing and dining. Made our Belfast trip very enjoyable!",5,2018,05,22
226,Felt like home from home!,From arrival it was clear that every effort was being made to make me feel as comfortable as possible in a totally unobtrusive way. They had thought of everything! I loved this hotel and can't wait to come back. ,5,2018,05,21
226,Needs some tweaks,Staff were lovely and room was spacious. I had difficulty in controlling the air conditioning as the dial was not easy to use. My window did not open so needed win-con. The water in bathroom tap and bath was only lukewarm-fortunately the shower was hot.,4,2018,05,21
226,very nice,"this hotel had a super location. the breakfast was also lovely. but that's where the 5 star feel ended. 
when we asked at check in where to park the car, we were told across the road (into a pay carpark which is used by many, and found it hard to find a parking space) we were surprised that parking was to be paid for, not usual for a 5 star hotel?
tgen on arrival to our room, i entered, to an open door,and got a startle when there was a man in our bathroom fixing something. he appologised, and said maintanance. 
following this we noticed our view in our small room, was an actual building site. it really wasnt nice at all, but we decided that we wouldnt be spending too much time in the room so didnt mention to front of house.
dinner was not of a high standard, and after being charged for supplements which were not stated on the menu  (lovely girl appologised)we enjoyed the rest of our evening in the bar listening to a talanted singer indeed!!
breakfast was delicious and staff lovely.
on departure however, we were given a bill with an EXTRA charge if 180 sterling!!!!
we asked to see the bill and 4 items on tge bill were not ours??? front of house appologised Again' and addmitted we were given the bill for another persons room ???
we enjoyed our stay, but not convinced this is a 5 star hotel at all",3,2018,05,17
226,.,"Central location. Pretty  and elegant interiors. Good for a short stay. Average service. Rooms weren't the cleanest, a lot of dust. Sheets had old stains on them (gross). Kingsized bed was just two beds put together. Average for a 5 star hotel. 

",3,2018,05,15
226,Amazing hotel and wonderful staff,"I had an amazing stay on my first visit to Belfast and the hotel staff greeted me and ensured the process of accessing my room and making me feel comfortable was quick and easy.

I hope I get to say again someday, this certainly is one of the major gems of Belfast, please don't hesitate to book, it is a loverly hotel with loverly staff.",5,2018,05,15
226,Spot on!,"Great location, friendly staff, modern clean bedrooms, everything you would expect from a 5 star.  The team was very knowledgeable about the local area. I did not have the opportunity to have breakfast but overheard other customers talking about the great offering.  ",5,2018,05,15
226,Excellent Holidays,"Located in the city with many pubs and restaurants nearby, many within walking distance. Super hotel with very good staff, great equipment (radio !!)
Starting point for our excursions to the Giats Causeway and the Titanic Museum",5,2018,05,14
226,An AMAZING afternoon tea,Was here today with my mother and my boyfriends mum for afternoon tea and was amazing from start to finish! Service was amazing nothing was to much trouble and went out of there way to do everything they could for us! Food was absolutely amazing! And loads of choice! I had a cocktail to beautiful! I have to give it to the hotel the staff are a credit to you! So friendly I‚Äôm returning next month with my boyfriend for a night stay in June and really looking forward to our stay! thank you for a really nice day!,5,2018,05,12
226,A nice experience ,The hotel is a true 5 star experience at a reasonable price. It is conveniently located in Belfast near the shopping district and other destinations. The staff were extremely friendly and helpful while the restaurant and bar were forest class. I enjoyed their selection of Irish whiskeys with selections I had not seen elsewhere.,5,2018,05,11
226,First class!,"Wonderful hotel, beautiful rooms and great staff that would help with anything! Would definitely stay again and highly recommend to others. Central to Belfast city and all it has to offer. Expensive but worth it üëå",5,2018,05,11
226,The best of the best.,"Love this hotel. From start to finish the staff can't do enough for you, rooms are comfortable and very modern. Food is absolutely delicisious. Only negative is that I can't stay for ever. Highly recommended!!!!",5,2018,05,11
226,Lovely stay,"Stayed at this hotel for 2 nights over May Bank Holiday as in Belfast for a concert. Hotel was lovely and staff very friendly. Had to change room after first night as building work opposite hotel kept us awake but change was made swiftly and no objection. Rooms are lovely and modern and have huge comfy beds. Tea/coffee facilities, bathrobes and hairdryer and toiletries all provided. The concierge team where so helpful and arranged car hire for us for a day to travel to Giants Causeway. Breakfast was lovely with hot and cold options. We had room service one night and food arrived quickly and was hot and very tasty. Fantastic location within easy walking to restaurants/bars and shopping center. Would certainly book this hotel again without hesitation.",5,2018,05,10
226,WONDERFUL 5*Experience in the Heart of Belfast.,Went with wife to Belfast for pre arranged Concert Date and chose this location based on recent Reviews and efficiency of Booking system.  Used Car Parking close by and were met on arrival by very efficient Check In Staff. Received complimentary Room Upgrade and were very impressed with Superior Room and all the wonderful extra Room amenities. VERY WELL APPOINTED with comfortable Bed and Air Conditioning. Hotel recently awarded AA 5*Star Rating and definitely well deserving of this HIGH QUALITY MARK. Particular mention to the fantastic Room turndown Service which was OUTSTANDING. Staff very friendly and Breakfast beautifully presented- Eggs Benedict to die for!!!! Great location for Concert in City Centre and Hotel busy with visitors from across the World. GREAT 5 * experience ,5,2018,05,10
226,Amazing!!,I booked an overnight stay for my boyfriends birthday and it was amazing! The staff were so friendly and could not do enough for us. The breakfast was beautiful and was exactly what we ordered. Would definitely stay again,5,2018,05,08
226,Dissatisfied,"Comparing this to other hotels I‚Äôve stayed in I wouldn‚Äôt say it lives up to its five stars. If I returned to Belfast I would certainly stay elsewhere.

The main issue was that our room (a superior king room, number 216) was next to a room where housekeeping staff gathered, and they were not considerate about the noise they made. On the first morning of our stay they were talking loudly from 7.30am (and singing happy birthday...). When checking out, I started to mention this and the receptionist was so familiar with the issue he finished my sentence for me. (I said ""we were next to a room where the housekeeping staff gather"" and he said ""so it was a bit noisy""). No apology.

There were also somebody else‚Äôs drinks on the bill when we checked out. Soundproofing in general was an issue as we could hear other guests moving around as if they were in our room. The view from the window was of a concrete wall.

One other thing also bothered me about our experience. The bathrooms have a sign about the hotel's commitment to the environment, encouraging guests to reuse towels. When we arrived at the hotel the heating in our room was on full, despite it being the hottest day of the year so far. Also, the radio was playing (presumably to provide a soothing welcome... though if we hadn't checked-in until midnight I guess it would have been playing all day). When our room was made up, all of the lights were left on, again presumably to create a pleasant experience when the guest returns. This bugged me, because it makes the whole re-using towels patter completely disingenuous - presumably if there were  any real commitment to the environment the hotel would seek to save energy in other ways too.",2,2018,05,08
226,Perfection!!,"A huge and gracious thank you to GM Cian Flanders for looking after us, we could not have had a better experience. Beautiful property, amazingly comfortable accommodations and super lovely staff. This was our first time in Belfast and the Fitzwilliam and their hospitality were an integral part of  the lasting impression that was made. If only we could have stayed longer than one night.....next time!!",5,2018,05,08
226,Best hotel I've ever stayed in,"Got an amazing deal on booking.com. Have never been able to afford a 5* hotel before so I was expecting a lot. And the Fitzwilliam definitely delivered. Everything was to the highest standards. From the men parking our cars, bringing up luggage for us, the amazing bedroom & bathroom, the robe left on your bed in the evening with a chocolate on your pillow, the location. Have never experienced anything like this. Just eye opening how the standards of a hotel can be so high. Thank you so much for this experience Fitzwilliam Hotel.",5,2018,05,08
226,Hilariously Bad!!,"I booked 3 nights in this hotel last week traveling up from Dublin. My wife read a thing on Facebook that people should mention when checking in to hotels, that they will be writing a nice review on trip advisor which could get them some perks (obviously that tip wasn't meant for Belfast or the Fitzwilliam).

We arrived at check in and we commented on our Trip Advisor review, being nice and friendly. Well the receptionist just turned into a Robot, no banter no comment no craic.

We went into the room and the first thing we noticed was the noise and it was really bad so obviously the rooms are not sound proofed, road works and passing traffic, but the roadworks were very bad they stopped around 6pm but started the next morning.  Food not great also and waiting staff on the friday night were in a hurry to get away. i over heard one lad complaining that he wanted to be away asap as he was going out and he had a steak order in.  Its a nice central hotel but the manager would need to waken up and sort out some order with his or her staff, if you were to ask me would i go back i would say yes in 30 years time when I'm going deaf and my teeth are falling out,",1,2018,05,08
226,top class,keep doing what yous are doing the room was first class service was first class breakfast was top class every thing about the hotel was great the staff were friendly the hotel is in a great location I will be back.,5,2018,05,08
226,Belfast - beyond your expectations,"Warm welcome, beautiful rooms, lots of surprising extras, great location  and superb food. Worldclass staff helped us out in everything, excellent service and information -
congrats for your human resources Fitzwilliam Hotel Belfast.",5,2018,05,06
226,Amazing two night stay,"Stayed at the Fitzwilliam Hotel Belfast for two nights, on a mini city break, and had a wonderful experience. Very knowledgable and attentive staff, clean rooms, and extremely comfy beds. Would definitely recommend!",5,2018,05,06
226,I keep coming back...,"A consistent service which brings me back to the hotel a few times.  Really nice rooms, excellent WiFi, small choc treat each evening is always a plus! Location is great with so much close by in terms of eatery, a walk to local tourist places, etc.  ",5,2018,05,04
226,Going to a concert at SSE,"Excellent stayed before
But was just as good had room 418 twin room. Lovely and quiet 
All amenities were first class. Separate shower and a bath. 

Had light lunch in restaurant only panini. But delicious and restaurant staff were very efficient and friendly

Great hotel and all the staff are 5üåüfrom the receptionist to the bedroom staff 

",5,2018,05,03
226,Weekend Break,"Have stayed in the Fitzwilliam on many previous occasions and again had a really good experience, the staff are very friendly and helpful, all rooms are spotless and very comfortable and the service is excellent.  Will be back ",5,2018,05,02
226,Good weekend Location,"A two night stay in a convenient and well appointed hotel with excellent breakfast and some luxury nice touches. Impressed with the way the staff all engaged and were very friendly and knowledgeable on the locality. Most things within walking distance, although the Titanic exhibition is a taxi ride away ( and I would not recommend staying down there until further building provides more restaurants etc). Would definitely recommend for a weekend away in Belfast. Whoever delivers the staff training well done!!",5,2018,05,01
226,Wonderful Hotel in Belfast,Just completed our second stay at the wonderful Fitzwilliam hotel in Belfast.  An excellent experience all round from the welcome on arrival to the well appointed and peaceful rooms.  The real gem is the staff who are all friendly and helpful.  Can‚Äôt wait for our next visit!,5,2018,05,01
226,A touch of Luxury,"A treat for my Husband's 50th birthday coupled with a show at the SSE arena. It was the extra little touches in the room - a stereo CD player, a candle on the bath, double shower & double-ended bath, super comfy huge bed & chocolates in the turn-down service. We even found a pack of cards & some mints. The lobby staff were excellent & remembered our names. Breakfast was amazing. Choice of hot meal cooked to order. Fruits, yoghurts, pastries, muffins, cheese, ham, chirozo, bread's. their home-made wheaten bread was the best I've ever tasted - sweet with a hard crust.
Location was brilliant, just 5-10mins walk to the city hall & 20mins to the SSE arena. I felt I got value for my money & the hotel lived up to my expectations. (Hubby was impressed too)
Would I go again, for a special occasion yes, but it's too pricey for regular use.",5,2018,04,30
226,Curates egg,"The furnishings, fittings, bed and staff at the hotel were all excellent (although the flush mechanism on my toilet fell out of the wall the first time I used it!). The breakfasts were good. Bar service, range of drinks and atmosphere were good. The dinner I had was disappointing (huge portions, but the main course differed from the menu description and contained some elements that were not pleasant; essentially the cost was out of proportion to my enjoyment of the food).
The room was affected by street noise, particularly in the morning.",3,2018,04,30
226,Best in Belfast,Perfect stay for our anniversary. From the minute we arrived at reception we were made to feel special. A happy anniversary card along with some complimentary goodies were waiting in our room. Lovely touch. Thanks you so much to all of the team. Hope to you be back very soon.,5,2018,04,30
226,Nice Hotel/Great Location and service but watch out for the shower floor!,"Great service, nice breakfast spread and restaurant.  Friendly desk and helpful concierge.  Except for some construction noise I thought the hotel and room were quite nice.  However, they have inadequate lighting in the bathroom for makeup application.  The bathroom decor, though lovely, should come with a printed eye-level warning as you enter the walk-in shower.  Though I saw the mat rolled up outside I didn‚Äôt think I‚Äôd need it....it‚Äôs a deep shower with a long panel of glass and once I turned the water on it turned into a Slip N Slide!  There is a grab bar inside but I couldn‚Äôt hold onto it and get to the edge of the long glass panel to exit without a lot of effort.  Did make it out safely and thereafter used the matt which was longer than normal but could stand to be even longer.  Why doesn‚Äôt the hotel do some sort of treatment to those slippery shower floors?",4,2018,04,29
226,Business,"Excellent Hotel - Staff and facilities are the best I have seen in a long time 
Would go back in a heartbeat
Food brilliant and the service is flawless.
Not as expensive as you would think and rooms beautiful",5,2018,04,28
226,Would recommend the Fitzwilliam very highly,"From the moment we stepped into reception to the moment we left, the service at the Fitzwilliam was absolutely excellent from all members of the staff. The reception staff were very helpful with our queries having just arrived and made some excellent recommendations as to where to visit in Belfast. The doormen were really friendly, attentive, and could not do enough to help. Ask them anything and they'll oblige. 
The rooms are beautiful, the beds are HUGE and extraordinarily comfortable and the bathrooms luxuriously appointed. Everything is provided, even a small CD and radio. 
The room service is excellent, and the breakfasts delicious and generous, and the hotel itself ideally positioned in the city. 
I honestly couldn't fault our stay, and for the price it's excellent value.",5,2018,04,27
226,Daughters birthday trip,"Located right near the coach station which was easy from the airport ¬£11 return. Central to everything, easy walking distance to the Titanic experience. All staff were very pleasant and helpful which made the whole trip fantastic.",5,2018,04,27
226,Perfect stay,"Beautiful room well equipted and modern. A hotel that goes the extra mile and is top class. Nice staff. I especially love the bluetooth radio player in the room and the light dim switches. Rokm was spotless, so clean and luxury",5,2018,04,26
226,Birthday Treat,Took my 82 year old mum to this hotel and had an excellent stay.  Staff were so helpful and kind.  Rooms were really well decorated and and extremely comfortable.  Beds turned down at night and extra little touches.  Concierge's were 10 star.  Food and bar staff amazing.  Thoroughly enjoyed our stay. Excellent location.,5,2018,04,25
226,First class,"From check in to check out was first class. Jessica at reception was friendly and helpful and was sincerely apologetic about our only criticism ( builders waking us at 7am which was not the hotels problem). The room was clean, quiet ( until 7am) and the turnover service was a lovely treat. We enjoyed cocktails in the bar with interactive staff and David gave us excellent service for breakfast. All very modern, professional and relaxed.",5,2018,04,23
226,Amazing Experience,"The Fitzwilliam Hotel Belfast is an amazing place to stay.  It is conveniently located in the center of the city, a quick easy walk to a lot of places.  The hotel staff was stellar.  Everyone is so friendly and helpful.  They were professional and accommodating.   Our room was comfortable and clean.   

We treated ourselves to two, afternoon tea reservations, a meal in the restaurant, a couple meals and drinks in the bar, as well as room service, during our stay.   It was all excellent.  The entire staff was great.  

Sleeping was wonderful.  The room was so comfortable and quiet.  Housekeeping always made sure our room was supplied with bottled water and they did a very fine job cleaning each day.  

The concierge was wonderful.  Each day was met with a warm smile and they usually inquired as to what your plans were for the day and offered suggestions if you were looking for some.   

We were sad to leave the Fitzwilliam, but will stay again and again, whenever we return to Belfast.",5,2018,04,22
226,Special Celebration,"I had rang The Fitzwilliam in Belfast to book afternoon tea for my sisters special birthday. I had booked a table for four. I had rang the week before we were going to confirm the booking and also to inform them of allergies as they requested in the previous phone call. I also asked as it was a special birthday could they add a few extras in for afternoon tea I was told that it would b noted.  When we got there I was told the table was booked for two, I said no I booked it for four.  We were then directed to our seat.  We were brought out the starter of soup etc.  I had booked the champagne afternoon tea we waited to see if we were going to get the champagne but in the end I had to ask for it. The waitress then brought out the starter after we had finished it the waiter brought out the sandwiches and pastries but no one had cleared the previous plates etc from the table. We had to ask for the table to be cleared and also to provide more side plates. The waiter stated there was fresh squeezed lemon in the sandwiches which one of my friends could not eat. I had told him this.  He took the cake stand away and brought the same one back with a few sandwiches off it.  He then gave my friend her own set of sandwiches.  He left. We thought he had gone to get the pots of tea but no again we had to ask for the pots of tea.  Also the little extra they added for my sisters birthday was a red oblong plate with happy birthday on it which we still laugh about.  It hadn't even a pastry on it. I have to say I was very disappointed with the service and the whole setting from the beginning as I had booked this as a surprise for my sister for her birthday.  We expected better especially for the price of it. The only positive outcome I can state is that we were not charged the full price.",2,2018,04,21
226,Paper thin walls,"All noises from next rooms could be heard. Doors bang -not properly adjusted. Some of the staff were exceptionally nice others couldn't care less: resulting to inbalanced service. Rich breakfast, too expensive for what it was. Basic gym facilities but open 24/7",4,2018,04,21
226,Regular visitor!,"Stayed end of October, swiftly followed by another stay at the beginning of Dec. Couldnt wait to stay again. Friendly check in, and fantastic rooms. Bed just soo comfy.  Some of the best cocktails in Belfast served in the bar. Staff very attentive. Always make sure we have lunch before we leave. Great food!",5,2018,04,20
226,Second time staying üòÅ,"As my title says, this is my second time at this hotel and on my next trip to Belfast I‚Äôll stay again. 
It‚Äôs a brilliant hotel and very well positioned to get around from.

Staff are excellent (as always) and very helpful.
Lovely rooms and very spacious. Beds and pillows are extremely comfy. You will get a good nights sleep. 

Ive only had breakfast here but the service and food is superb.

I cannot fault anything at all with the Fitzwilliam and I will stay here when I visit PA. 

Thank you

",5,2018,04,19
226,My new favourite Belfast hotel!,"I stayed here for one night recently and was hugely impressed. The staff were absolutely amazing, the rooms were fabulous. I just loved all the little touches - lovely chocolates, proper coffee, nice toiletries, monogrammed towels, not forgetting the treasure chest of lovely things under the tv. My two disappointments were that I was only there for one night and that the retro telephones were push button and not dial - that nearly caught me out late at night! I really recommend this hotel if you want a stylish treat in the city centre. ",5,2018,04,19
226,Great stay,"Just back from 2 night stay. There is a major building work going on across from the front  entrance so we asked to move rooms as building work starts at 8am. Thankfully they were able to oblige. Our room was lovely , very modern and lots of nice touches like bottled water, a  cafetiere and filter coffee and turn down service. Very little power points in the room. There was a couple hidden behind the TV and another couple in the hallway area so I moved one of the coffee tables into that area to plug in the kettle and phone charger. Breakfast is excellent, great choice, excellent produce and very friendly staff. Location is excellent, very centrally located. We had a drink both nights in the bar, friendly staff but lacking atmosphere. I would definitely stay there again.",4,2018,04,18
226,Fantastic Hotel,My Husband & I stayed here on Sat the 14th of April for 1 night.  What a beautiful Hotel. Room was gorgeous. Breakfast excellent. But the best thing is the staff. So friendly and welcoming. (Everyone especially Reception & Conceirge) Will definetely be booking again soon. ,5,2018,04,16
226,Very Disappointing,"The title says it all for me, a 5 star hotel that is more interested in excuses and making guests feel uncomfortable as opposed to actually making our stay memorable and enjoyable. We had to move rooms as our Signature room faced a brick wall and array of industrial sides trash containers below it, plus there was plenty of the previous guests hair to make it very uncomfortable. The second room was a lower standard and cost less but until I brought it a refund was not forthcoming, embarrassing for me and the hotel in my view. Offered a paper but it never arrived. Roadworks begun on a Sunday morning right outside our room at 8.30am!! CRAZY! 
The breakfast, continental buffet followed by Al a Carte hot menu offered, sounds great right, WRONG! Continental breakfast was near completely empty, when I enquired would be re-filled, I was told ",2,2018,04,16
226,Great hotel in CBD,"This is a great hotel. The service has been exceptional, especially from Phillip, the AM concierge. 
The rooms are great and I'm able to cool it enough to sleep well. The rooms are well appointed and insulated from outside noise. However, interior lighting is terrible.",4,2018,04,16
226,Wonderful Belfast Hotel,"Just stayed two nights at the Fitzwilliam Belfast early April and enjoyed it from check in to check out.  Great staff with everyone being friendly, helpful and kind in every way. Location was perfect to explore Belfast City.",5,2018,04,14
226,Perfect stay,"Absolutely perfect - cant fault a single thing. Great rooms, great service and a real feel of Luxury. Stayed in the Europa on Monday night - which was nice, but not at the same level as the Fitzwilliam. Brilliant rooms, super clean and luxury bathrooms , excellent service in the bar and the Concierge was brilliant (just simple tasks, but done with courtesy and professionalism). Definately my choice for next time in Belfast.",5,2018,04,14
226,Great hotel and staff,"Stayed here with friends for a weekend and it was a nice hotel with really good staff.  It's pricey, but you get what you pay for!  We had a great couple of nights out in Belfast.  friendly people and great bars!",4,2018,04,12
226,Fabulous City Break,"We visited the cocktail bar and loved it. So an overnight stay here was on our ‚Äúbucket list‚Äù. It exceeded expectations. Stunning decor. Art Deco inspired with very up to date amenities. Beautiful room with large double bed, day bed, magazines. Love the dimmed lighting and mirrored doors. Very atmospheric. Coffee maker, bath and separate shower. Make up/ shaving mirror too ( always a sign of a good hotel). Quiet and peaceful. Breakfast was delicious. Self service , and menu optional. Service was impeccable and our waiter was charming. All set in a prime location in Belfast city centre with historic pubs,restaurants,shops and the opera house within yards of the front door. ",5,2018,04,11
226,Mini Break in Belfast,"Executive room spacious and well appointed , however quite a dark feeling in the whole  hotel in particular the bar and restaurant. They need to serve afternoon tea in the lobby or somewhere light and airy. At breakfast toast was forgotten and items missing from the table , sugar , milk etc, had to ask for them, no one asked if everything was ok at breakfast. Gym area is very disappointing and needs to be expanded. ",4,2018,04,09
226,Night away ,"Me and my partner booked this hotel for one night away. It definitely delivered! The girl at reception (blonde hair sorry I didn‚Äôt get her name!) was just great to deal with very friendly and welcoming. The rooms are fab and there was a lovely smell when you entered, we had cocktail vouchers although there was no space in the bar we were offered to have our drink order taken out to the lobby to us , we decided against it and went back to the bar later in the evening. The bed was one of the most comfortable I have ever slept in and would book again on that basis alone! On one occasion our room keys wouldn‚Äôt open our door so I went to reception they where very apologetic and had it sorted straight away. Next morning we got up and went for breakfast. We had it included in our room package it was nice but wouldn‚Äôt be worth ¬£20 each. Overall we can‚Äôt wait to return!",5,2018,04,09
226,Weekend stay,"Hotel was very central to all main tourist attractions for us, we like to walk yo places. There are plenty of restaurants and gastro bars to satisfy all taste buds. Rooms in the hotel are of a good size with ample toiletries. Tea and coffee was plentiful and they also provided bottle water free. I thought the mints ear plugs cards and writing notepads were a nice extra. The hotel also provide a pillow service with nice chocolates. Would highly recommend this hotel as it tics all the boxes",4,2018,04,09
226,Fantastic hotel,We had a really brilliant stay in the fitzwilliam for a friend's hen party. From the word go the staff were fab. Out to meet the party coming in for limo posed for photos. Helped in with everything. Check in was fab. I had to put gifts in the hens room. Guys at desk so helpful in particular Nathan. Liam on concierge was brilliant. They joined on't he crack and very professional. My sister cut her arm and Nathan sent up a plaster. Sean Paul at our cocktail class was excellent. A few cocktails wernt taken at the class and he sent them up to our dinner. Food was outstanding. Seanna (I think) was a lovely waitress and impresses when she had a chat at breakfast. Breakfast was beautiful and  really good choice. Only thing I would say a few rips here on bed linen and a few of us girls were saying there's was the same. However I wouldn't mark anything against the hotel for this. We had a great time. Tha k you all so much will definatly recommend the hotel to other groups. ,5,2018,04,09
226,Great Hotel with friendly staff,This was a great place to stay for the Waterfront arena  and for the ballet.  Hotel staff is very friendly and helpful.  The room was comfortable and quiet.  The breakfast was very nice and had lots of choices.  ,5,2018,04,09
226,Luxurious and Comfortable. With the most amazing views.,"I would recommend this hotel to anyone looking to celebrate a special occasion or just enjoying a weekend away with a loved one. We were given an upgrade upon arrival to omrhe most beautiful hotel room I have ever stayed in. The views of the golden mile were breathtaking. And everything from the staff, service to decor and ambience was impeccable!",5,2018,04,08
226,Top Class Experience,Great ambiance Brilliant concierge and hotel staff. Beautiful room and well appointed as a first class five star hotel should provide. Great bar with top class staff and excellent bar food. Nothing a problem for the staff to attend to in a professional manner ,5,2018,04,08
226,Excellent stay at the Fitzwilliam,"We had a fantastic stay at the Fitzwilliam, the room was very spacious and the bed was extremely comfortable, we arrived home to a turn down service which was a lovely treat, bottled water and chocolates. The hotel is in the perfect location to access the city centre and the staff are very welcoming. We would definitely recommend the fitzwilliam.",5,2018,04,07
226,It's the little things...,"We stayed at the Fitzwilliam for 3 nights and I can highly recommend it to anyone looking for a touch of class to their Belfast trip. Every little detail made our stay, down to the pleasant staff who greet you always by name, the in room facilities or the turn down service. Our room was spacious clean and comfortable, the chocolates on our pillow each evening were delicious. The staff were all very friendly and welcoming and advised us on things to do as well as parking - which is not advertised as clearly online. I would advise anyone who hasn't booked parking at the Fitzwilliam to use the car park across the road and the hotel staff will sign your ticket and you will receive a discounted rate. I really enjoyed our stay at the Fitzwilliam despite one hiccup with a slightly rude night porter- however this was quickly rectified by an extremely friendly and attentive bar man. I would stay again in a heart beat. ",5,2018,04,07
226,Family treat ,"From arriving to leaving our stay was perfect ,the staff couldn't do enough for us ,the rooms stunning throughout a truly wonderful stay ,such a central location we had so much to do . The hotel was  first class not to be faulted in any way .",5,2018,04,06
226,"Super location, perfect staff minor shortfalls","We stayed there for four nights. My room was a corner suite and was well worth the extra few quid. Super modern layout with a bathtub practically in the living/bedroom. Housekeeping was top notch.
All the staff were as good and professional as anyone could wish. I give them my best praise.
The bar was supposed to be open to three in the morning but we arrived at around 23:00 on the first night we were told that proper bar service had essentially ended but we could sit in the lobby and order drinks from there. That is simply not the same thing. The bar had no olives so not Dry Martini :-( The breakfast buffet was rather sparse consisting of cereals, toast and a limited selection of deli meats, salmon and herring. There is a a la carte menu offering rather small selection of ""free"" entrees and only two more substantial entrees that were sold.
We had one dinner in the hotel. Of four dishes three were sub-par. The dish that listed as cod and smoked eel had neither cod nor eel. The duck leg confit was dry and unimpressive. etc.
Go stay at the hotel and enjoy its design and staff but eat at one of many excellent restaurants in the close vicinity.",4,2018,04,05
226,Best Hotel Experience of all times,"Impeccable troughout the whole stay. Unbeatable in style and comfort. I love this style so much and it is not just  one of those good looking but highly unpractical stylish hotels that have furniture and gadgets that are either not comfortabel or do not work properly or serve a real purpose. Everything is thought through and makes sense, smells and looks good. The great service and personal attention are topping up the experience and make so superior. It will be hard to find ourselves happy again staying elsewhere. ",5,2018,04,05
226,very disappointed,the lobby in the hotel was freezing on arrival sat beside the fire only to be told i would have to move soon as the table was reserved (really) i could not beleive this got to the room and the heat was broke but it took the second fella liam to help so he moved me to another room well done liam what a really lovely fella ,5,2018,04,05
226,Very very disappointed,Went to this hotel 2_4 April 2018.they put me in room 203 and it was a very cold day arrived a bit early so I sat in the lobby which was very cold I sat beside a fire and the girl came to me and said this table is reserved so I had to move.got to my room and it was freezing so tried to put the heat on which is a contraption on the wall that u need the torch on Ur phone to c it because of the dim lighting the heat did not come on so went to the desk and asked for help they sent a concierge (a man) up to my room he set the heat and told me when it gets to warm just turn it of.waited another couple of hours and still no heat so I rang down to the desk and they sent Leon up what a lovely young man he informed me the heating in my room was broke and he moved me to another room which was facing the cleaners  office I was up so early that morning I tried to have a nap in the afternoon I slept for 10 mins because the cleaners were so noisy and the doors don't keep the noise out u can hear everything that is going on in the corridors I had about 8_9 hours sleep in 2 nights I wore earplugs just incase but they had no affect.and the noise of the traffic is bad you would think the windows were open I don't think the double glazing works. and the banging doors nearly drove me mad. you can't pull the handles down on the outside of the door when Ur leaving the room so the doors bang I heard this at 3.30and 4 in the morning. it is a beautiful hotel but very noisy I have stayed in 3star hotels which was a lot quieter.the staff are really friendly they can't do enough for you. Breakfast is great everything u could want but the tomato ketchup is that bad it tastes like vinegar when I tried it it hit the back of my throat I could not stop coughing the waiter had to bring me some water to b honest I have stayed at jurrys in opposite the Fitzwilliam and in my opinion it's a far better hotel and it's a 3* I think it's safe to say I won't be going back to the fitzwilliam.wen I was checking out I told the desk clerk about my stay and all I was offered was an appology?,1,2018,04,04
226,Easter break,Excellent service and location. Great value. Lovely modern decor. Would happily stay again. Loved the little luxurious extras like the turn down service. Proximity to Crown Bar and Robinson's a bonus!,5,2018,04,03
226,Not 5 star. Avoid,"This was a birthday treat, well, intended to be. Not impressive when you arrive everywhere is dark and dingy. Staff are not nice very unfriendly, how this place ever got 5 stars I do not know! The rooms are average nothing special has the feel of 'business trip' all over. Functional but no extras. We ate in the restaurant which was ok but again nothing special for the price tag. It wasn't too busy which maybe says a lot. Breakfast not of 5 star quality again average hotel breakfast. If you are looking for somewhere special don't book here!! I've stayed in many hotels and can't see why this one is awarded 5 stars for the life of me. More like 3, don't waste your money like we did. Total rip off, do your research before booking is my advice!",1,2018,04,03
226,"Luxurious, friendly, superbly appointed","Fabulous location with welcoming staff. The room was gorgeous, linens and pillows were luxurious. Even a lovely terry cloth robe was provided. Location was central to everything. The hotel was fabulous and I would definitely stay here again.",5,2018,04,03
226,simply the best,the fitz was possibly the best hotel we chave stayed in. Facilities cand staff were faultless. If you stay at another Belfast hotel you are doing yourself a disservice. My daughter stayed concurrently at the Europa and the Fitz surpassed it on every level. Level of care from staff way above and beyond call of duty. Wonderful stay.,5,2018,04,02
226,Great location & very nice hotel,"My daughter and i stayed here for 4 nights in March and truly enjoyed it.  the staff is helpful and the hotel is in a great location for Central Belfast.  Rooms are a nice size, with good amenities.  The bar is cozy and the breakfast is nicely done.",4,2018,04,01
226,AMAZING,Absolutely loved the hotel I cannot wait to return. The staff where amazing room was beautiful very very clean comfortable. Perfect location. So relaxing. The bar was brilliant and the beds are very comfy ,5,2018,03,30
226,Sadly not a 5* experience...,"We arrived and were greeted by a very friendly and helpful Simon, a great welcome to the hotel.

The room itself was very nice however dark in its decor, the bathroom even more so. In the bathroom there was one small shelf for toiletries but nowhere else for storage. There was also no drawers in the room for clothes apart from the wardrobe.  The bed was large but not the most comfortable. 

Unfortunately, after two nights of excessive traffic noise we asked to move rooms to a quieter part of the hotel. (We emailed in advance to request a quiet room but this was not the case) we understand that we were staying in a city centre hotel but it was just too much. Moving rooms was an easy process with Simon again being very helpful. 

The second room was much brighter and slightly larger. Again with a comfortable bed and sofa. We were not very happy to find gone off milk in our fridge... not great and falls below the expectations of a 5* hotel. 

The next morning there was no hot water in the room and after attempts from maintenance and a 1.5hr delay to our day this was still not fixed and we had to have cold showers. This sort of issue is no ones fault but it was a huge shame and put a dampener on the day. 

The concierge were extremely helpful and were glad to be of our assistance a number of times. 

Sadly, the breakfast was a disappointment for us. Firstly, the room was so dark and full of artificial light, we found it was an oppressive environment to start the day. There was opportunity for views of the city and natural light but they were not made use of. 

The staff were attentive and welcoming. The 'continental' option was minimal with few options available, not even toast. Instead you had to order the hot dishes from a menu... this delayed our breakfast significantly due to the wait involved. One morning we had to cancel our breakfasts as 30 minutes was not enough time for our food to be delivered and we had a booked a day trip so had to leave. The whole process would have been slicker if the traditional buffet style was available. 

Upon check out, we spoke to a manager who offered to refund us for one of our three nights which we gratefully accepted. However after a number of issues adding up we left disappointed. Simply, over our stay, the Fitzwilliam did not live up to the billing as one of the best hotels in the city, and certainly not the 5* standards we expected. It was a shame as first impressions were so positive. 

Belfast itself is a great city with lots to see and explore. Nearby restaurant Home is a recommendation as well as Howard Street - both delicious.",3,2018,03,30
226,Don and Sue Nelson,We thoroughly enjoyed our stay at The Fitzwilliam. The hotel was very modern and beautifully appointed. The staff were exceedingly friendly and helpful. The hotel was ideally situated to explore the delights of Belfast. Would definately recommend the hotel.,5,2018,03,30
226,betty & alan,during our 2-night stay we were very impressed with how friendly all staff were. there was a great sense of pride and confidence among all staff members and everything was handled in a calm and efficient manner. We would have no hesitation in returning in the future.,5,2018,03,29
226,Central City Perfection ,"A lovely stay at the Fitzwilliam, the rooms are exceptional, clean and very comfortable, the turn down service was a special extra touch. This hotel is city centre and accessible to all the shops and sights. Simon checked me in and was really welcoming. A great hotel a lovely relaxing stay. ",5,2018,03,28
226,Great Weekend break,"From arrival to departure we were looked after extremely well, our car was valet parked and bags brought up to our room. the room was a good size and very comfortable, the Hotel is just around the corner from the famous Crown bar and a short walk into the City.
The Hotel bar was comfortable and service was excellent with the added bonus of some Live music.",4,2018,03,28
226,"Fantastic staff, brilliant hotel","Hotel is in an excellent central location within walking distance of all main attractions, staff were very welcoming and extremely helpful, food delicious and rooms spacious and comfortable. Highly recommend this hotel especially if travelling with children.",5,2018,03,27
226,Unfriendly service,"On a fourteen day trip to Ireland, we spent the last two days at the Fitzwilliam Hotel in Belfast. The hotel is clean, well furnished and is perfectly located around restaurants and the theatre. In almost every case, I would give this type  of a hotel 4 - 5 stars. Unfortunately, the services staff - especially in the dining hall - were so unfriendly and inept that I can only give it a 3 star. Even then I am being generous. We went to both dinner and breakfast at the restaurant and were taken aback at how unfriendly everyone was. The wait time just to give our order was 20 + minutes. For that reason, we will have a hard time staying with an hotel associated with the Fitzwilian Hotel.",3,2018,03,26
226,Back to high standards ,"Visited this hotel recently for two nights with family. Found the booking process easy and reception quite helpful when I rang to discuss some additional requests. Lobby remains very pleasant, the executive room I had on the 5th floor was quiet, very comfortable and spacious, and the other members of our party who got a deluxe room were hugely impressed by the standard of the room and the view. The last time I was in this hotel I was concerned it was getting dated but saw no signs of that on this occasion. The concierge was quite helpful in terms of booking the city bus tour for us. The breakfast was very pleasant with a decent buffet and menu items (perhaps one of those in-vogue Irish breakfast/salad combinations might be a good addition in the future?). I was a little sad to see that the bar has gone more towards a cocktail vibe with table service prioritised. I would prefer it the bar was kept as it had been for those who don't want to treat a simple drink as a sit-down session with menus etc. Surely they could do both? But otherwise I had no concerns and was happy to bring my relatives to this hotel and a great weekend was had by all. It is a reasonably expensive hotel, but in my opinion gives good value.",5,2018,03,26
226,Relaxing break,"Ideal for a Relaxing break. Very friendly and accommodating staff; lovely decorated rooms and the hotel is in a great location, you can walk pretty much everywhere you need to. Food was tasty and it was good value. Bar did nice cocktails.",5,2018,03,26
226,Afternoon tea delight,"We gave in to the trend of afternoon tea and thankfully chose this place,everything was amazing,service was friendly and everything you would expect from a 5* establishment! It was that good we'll be heading back to sample some of the rest of the menu.",5,2018,03,25
226,"Hotel Driver, Daniel made our week fun and easy!","What made the Fitzwilliam different was the experience we took away from the hotel in our driver, Daniel Greer. I had the good fortune to stay at the Fitzwilliam in Belfast last month for 10 days and met Daniel and used his service for a day trip to my family‚Äôs church and townland in Dungannon and surrounds, and airport transfers to and from Dublin.
I returned just last week to Ireland and knew I needed to see the country with my cousins and thought of no better way than to have Daniel be our guide. My cousins and I felt that we made a friend in Daniel as he joined into our group with great humor, good ideas and of course careful and timely driving. Our Games of Thrones tour ending at Giant‚Äôs Causeway was great fun as well as beautiful, our day tour to Tara Hill, Newgrange and the Battle of the Boyne was highly informative and almost mystical, and our visit to Athlone to celebrate our Mom‚Äôs at the oldest bar, Sean‚Äôs was great fun and wonderfully sentimental. 
Our stay at the Fitzwilliam was truly enhanced by our touring experience with Daniel Greer.",4,2018,03,25
226,Belfast hotel,"Excellent hotel, luxurious in feel and good value for what you get.  Right next to the theater and in the heart of downtown.  I went for business and found i could walk to good restuarants as well as business area's in about 20 minutes.  Staff goes above and beyond, and I would recommend it.",5,2018,03,23
226,A reason to return to Belfast,Really great hotel to stay. Welcome on arrival was excellent. Staff very helpful. Location is absolutely perfect. The room was really comfortable and spacious. Bed soooooo comfyüòÉ. I will definitely be back. Highly recommend it.,5,2018,03,23
226,5* star service ,With the awful weather on the weekend of the 3rd of March my plans for a mother daughter weekend was changed... I rang and booked 2 rooms for that Saturday night and explained to Victoria that it was to celebrate to birthdays... and she couldn‚Äôt do enough for us! The staff in the hotel where amazing from start to finish!!  The rooms the service and the food was Fantastic!! Can‚Äôt wait to return!! ,5,2018,03,22
226,SLIGHTLY LACKING FIVE STAR DELIVERY,"Welcome and check in is five star quality. The rooms ,while not large  are tastefully furnished with lots of quirky extras , umbrella , choice of teas and as someone  previously mentioned ,turned down bed sheets and chocolates on the pillow. The bathroom with choice of bath and shower is finished to the highest standard. As someone also mentioned , the foyer has lovely seated area and a glowing gas fire , but the automatic doors allow a continuous draft. We had decided to eat something in the bar but with a big rugby match on, no tables were available . The breakfast has all the right ingredients but falls short on delivery. Simple things like no tea spoon , or toast is a lack of staff training. The full breakfast consists of two rasher , one sausage ,one each black and white pudding , all cooked to order. Overall a nice experience , but room to improve",4,2018,03,20
226,wedding,"Room lovely and comfortable, didn't find staff approachable, dining room experience....average, slow service, had to keep reminding waiting staff who appeared to forget orders or brought wrong order. Front reception area freezing cold.....but the ornamental flames looked appealing. Wouldn't be enticed back in a hurry.",3,2018,03,19
226,Disappointed after a great start. ,"We spent last night at the hotel and I have to say it started off superbly. Our checkin experience was definitely 5 star, Jessica was fantastic. The room was beautiful and very much to our satisfaction. We decided to stay and eat in the hotel, seemed pointless to go elsewhere when everything was pleasing us so much. We ate in the bar. The service was exceptional and the food delicious. Could not have been happier. Easily a 5 star review up to this stage. Sadly it all went wrong this morning. The breakfast experience was far from 5 star. Breakfast manager was off hand and unfriendly. Plenty of staff but simply ordering our breakfast took far too long. Part of our breakfast had to be asked for twice again, ordered 3 times, and we're still waiting for it!! No excuse for that. Jason then checked us out at reception. He was too busy telling me how impressed he was at making it into work after the weekend celebrations to be bothered asking if our stay had been satisfactory. He made a bad situation worse. It's a shame when there was so much about the Fitzwilliam we truly enjoyed. ",3,2018,03,19
226,Lovely friendly hotel,"Great weekend in a fantastic location, right in the heart of Belfast. Friendly staff, great food - would definitely come back for another visit. Belfast is a great city - lots to see and do, we will have to revisit to see more! ",5,2018,03,19

226,Wonderful,"Whenever I go to Belfast I always stay at The Fitzwilliam. The rooms are clean, the food is nice and the location can‚Äôt be beat.
I‚Äôve mentioned it before but it really is the staff that makes the stay so pleasant though. They will try in every way to sort out whatever you ask for, they‚Äôre so extremely friendly and professional and makes you feel like a family member rather than a stranger.
It is easily my favourite hotel out of all I‚Äôve visited.
There is some noise due to renovations and additions at the moment (soon there will be a spa)
and you are next to busy streets so there‚Äôs noise from there too, however in their care package they do supply earplugs in case it bothers you.

Thank you again for a wonderful stay. I‚Äôll see you soon.",5,2018,03,17
226,Great hotel,"Lovely hotel.  Cozy room, nicely styled. Great location, there are many stores, restaurants and bars around. Very good service with friendly staff. I would definitely recommend it! Very easy to get around.",4,2018,03,16
226,Too noisy,"This hotel is no way 5 star, i would rate as a 3 star. I was there with my mum, and 2 children for mothers day treat. The bedrooms are well decorated, but the hotel lacks atmosphere. The outside noise in the bedroom was horrendous, it felt like there was no glass in the windows, the noise was so bad...we only got a couple of hours sleep. We were due to stay 2 nights but checked out after the 1st night. The food in the bar was average and the kids meals were awful. Breakfast was very disorganised and the staff didnt seem to know what was going on. I have stayed in lots of hotels but unfortunately i will never stay here again....staff at reception were lovely and friendly though.",2,2018,03,16

226,Beautiful rooms,"Stayed for one night while working in Belfast city centre. The rooms are a very decent size and good facilities. A bath and a large shower available, with a thoughtful candle on the side of the bath. Lovely smellies, and thick towels. I would say these are not the quietest rooms- the hotel is on a major crossroads and road noise is very noticeable, as was the building work across the road which began at 7am. There are some ear plugs though in the room, and I used them so did get a good nights sleep. Breakfast is good- if you order a hot option the portions are large! staff very friendly",4,2018,03,14
226,Romantic break,"Managers in bar were so inefficient, they made themselves look efficient by walking fast but no quality behind it.  The  Doormen/bouncers looked appalling walking through the restaurant dressed slovenly and chewing gum, not 5 * standard. ",3,2018,03,14
226,Superb,"We stopped here as a birthday treat and I loved our stay. Great place to stay, location is perfect for exploring Belfast and the rooms are stunning, friendly helpful staff. I would recommend this hotel to anyone",5,2018,03,13
226,This is a must stay in Belfast,"Great location for everything! Restaurants, Pub's shopping and the history of the city. Be sure to talk to Phillip the concierge. Best advice for black cab tours, restaurants and Pubs. We spent a lot of time exploring the beautiful city of Belfast. ",5,2018,03,13
226,Honeymoon Finisher,"We finished our honeymoon which consisted of a tour of the northern counties with a stay in Belfast's Fitzwilliam Hotel. It was a fantastic way to end the journey. All of the staff are on another level of helpfulness and friendliness. We had a card from the management on our arrival as well as a congratulations message and some lovely macaroons. The room was huge and very comfortable and the hotel couldn't be better located in terms of access to tourist sites, the city centre, shops and restaurants/ bars. We also had the afternoon tea which was amazing. Also I don't drink alcohol but the bar staff made me some non alcoholic cocktails even though they were not on the very extensive drinks menu. While the hotel was great all round, it was really the staff who made it!",5,2018,03,12
226,An Irish Oasis ,"This hotel was a jewel of luxury bedded in a great location from all that Belfast has to offer. There was some construction happening in the surrounding area during our visit, but it didn‚Äôt matter - it was very peaceful & relaxing when it needed to be.  Hotel staff, in particular the reception staff were constantly offering to help and suggest things you may not of initially asked them for. There was a small delay to collecting our room key, but as we were planning to explore the city, we didn‚Äôt mind. They kept our bags for us and put them in our room for our return. Breakfast was a decent & large selection - the staff there even suggesting to try things on the menu - overall a lovely experience.  ",5,2018,03,12
226,Highly Recommend this hotel,"We were so impressed with this hotel from the first moment we walked through the doors. This was due to the friendly way we were greeted and the respectful way that we were treated throughout our recent visit. Our room was clean, very comfortable and has some lovely extra touches such as robes and slippers and the turn down service with complimentary chocolates on the pillow each evening was such a lovely touch. I also have to mention breakfast which was superb.",5,2018,03,10
226,"Great stay, great hotel!",The Fitzwilliam was centrally located to the Europa Bus Centre and Great Victoria Street Train Station.  It is also within walking distance to lots of sights.  Will recommend the hotel to family and friends.,5,2018,03,08
226,Wonderful Weekend,Had a wonderful weekend stay.  Staff were friendly and helpful. Rooms are spotless and luxurious. The food was exceptional. Great entertainment in the bar on Saturday evening. Would definately recommend a visit.,5,2018,03,07

226,wonderful stay,wonderful stay from start to finish - already planning my next visit.  Nothing was too much trouble  rooms were beautiful and the turn down service was a lovely experience!!  thanks so much for everything,5,2018,03,06
226,"Return visit, started off fab with a disappointing breakfast. ","The welcome and room were fabulous! The bar staff were very friendly and helpful. We enjoyed our over night and the turn down service was lovely. The breakfast was unfortunately disappointing. I asked for my bacon to be well cooked it arrived very under done, I asked for it to be cooked further. It returned very crispy within a minute. Now the potato bread was missing which another staff member brought for me. Apart from the replacement bacon and potato bread everything else wasn't hot, it was at best warm and because of this is all tasted a bit greasy. When the waitress cleared our plates she asked was everything OK as I hadn't eaten much. I explained the issues and she said she would speak to her supervisor which is immediately did. We sat finishing our coffee for about 5 mins. During this time no one returned to see if I would like anything else and the female supervisor walked past a couple of times but didn't stop to explain what had happened. So I left breakfast having a slice of toast and a few pieces of melon, not the best for ¬£20 per person! Very strange and disappointing, not what I would expect of a 3 star hotel never mind a 5 star! All in all a disappointing end to what was a lovely stay. Perhaps an off day for the chef and front house. ",4,2018,03,06
226,Very happy with this hotel ,"We very much enjoyed our stay in Belfast. 
The Fiztwilliam is perfectly situated, it‚Äôs a beautiful hotel. 
The standard rooms are little small for a 5 star, you should probably upgrade to the next one up. 
Breakfast is a little steep at 17 pounds per person. 
Excellent cocktail menu, and a really nice bar. ",4,2018,03,05
226,Not great!!,"I wasn't very impressed with my stay in the Fitzwilliam. As my boyfriend got me this stay for Valentine's, I was looking forward to it. We weren't greatly welcomed within the restaurant and waited 15-20 minutes on a drinks menu being issued to us, then a further ten minutes waiting on the drinks. We ordered RibEye steak from the menu and told we couldn't get gravy as the chef didn't reccomend it, never the less that it was what we wanted!! We also had 'steak knives' that were so blunt I doubt they could cut butter. Wouldn't recommend to be honest!! ",2,2018,03,05
226,Not worth the money - wouldn't say it's 5*,"Ive always wanted to stay in the Fitzwilliam and as a suprise my husband purchased a overnight stay voucher (¬£217.00 per night).  We decided to use it this weekend for my birthday.  Arriving i was very excited as the staff at reception were lovely, however when we got to our room i was disappointed, the room itself was clean but not what i imagined for the money.  The shower tiles were coming off the wall in places the lights in the bathroom had gaps around them you could see into the ceiling and we never slept all night as you could hear everything from outside (plus you could hear the next room's conversation) The food in the restaurant was beautiful but not a big selection of things to eat.  Overall I wouldn't say it was worth the money he paid and can't see me ever returning. ",3,2018,03,05
226,The fitzwilliam what a class place,Really enjoyed my stay at the fitzwilliam.  Celebrating my wife's birthday the hotel and staff were first class. Enjoyed a beautiful meal in the hotel restaurant and breakfast was excellent as well. The hotel bar was lovely good cocktail menu. Finished of the night with drinks in a few bars very close to the hotel. All in all a very good experience 10 out of 10,5,2018,03,05
226,The Movement,"We actually came to Belfast to see The Temperance Movement Band. Ended up getting so much more. In friendship, food and the experience of a lifetime. The local people are friendly and so helpful. Titanic Museum was so much more than I thought it would be. Weather did not permit us to do all things we wanted to but that just means we will have to return. I have no problem with that and would stay at the Fitzwilliam again.",5,2018,03,04
226,Great hotel,"From check in until departure the hotel was superb ,check in was speedy and efficient with a helpful and friendly member of staff .The room was lovely with huge bed and superb bathroom with large shower ,we dined in the restaurant and yet again was great from start to finish ,the food was excellent quality and staff were again very good .After dinner we stayed in the hotel bar which had a singer called Triona who was a great artist and thoroughly enjoyed her show , breakfast was freshly cooked ,which made a nice change from a buffet . Overall this hotel scores highly on all aspects, although the only slight downside might be a room overlooking a busy road may be noisy as we had some traffic noise but that was a Sunday so maybe worse during the week,but this a very small issue",5,2018,03,04
226,Wonderful stay,"I would highly recommend the Fitzwilliam Hotel, rooms are amazing, very friendly staff and luxurious yet relaxed atmosphere. If you require parking at the hotel, do this in advance as limited spaces. Would definitely stay again.",5,2018,03,04
226,Wonderful weekend break ,"I couldn‚Äôt be happier with my choice to book the Fitzwilliam from a courtesy call to inform me of a potential issue with my booking to the warm welcome we received despite arriving late due to a delayed flight. 

We had a suite on the 8th floor and the room was exceptional. Luxurious and well appointed. Loved the turn down service complete with chocolates on the pillow. 

Lovely breakfast each morning and the staff were friendly and warm and couldn‚Äôt do enough for us. We will be staying here again when we next visit Belfast. ",5,2018,03,04
226,Valentines over night stay,"Fantastic hotel... facilities,staff,food are excellent & the room was great. You are really made to feel relaxed and special by every single staff member. If you want a nice luxurious night away book in here.",5,2018,03,02
226,Lovely Friendly Hotel,"We stayed for 5 nights for a family function, this hotel is in a really convenient location and is beautifully appointed and set out.  But that isn't what makes it special.  The staff across the hotel are superb, friendly and attentive without being intrusive.  The bar is really nice, well stocked and welcoming, with great service.  The food is traditional and very good, again with great service.  Special mention to the concierge staff, very much the face of any hotel, and the concierges here do that as well as anywhere in the world.  We can't recommend this hotel enough.",5,2018,03,02
226,Great hotel,"1 night stay with my partner, modern contemporary room, bathroom clean with great shower and bath. Good choices at breakfast,turn down service was nice wonderful stay brilliant central location,super staff highly recommended",5,2018,03,01
226,Convenient enough but can‚Äôt agree it‚Äôs 5 star ,"Stayed here for 2 nights as part of a BA holiday package and chose it over others offered as had stayed at the one in Dublin and enjoyed it greatly there. 

Sadly the one in Belfast simply isn‚Äôt as good. Not bad but certainly not a 5 star hotel. Difficult to compete as the last time we stayed at the Merchant which is just brilliant so they were already up against it. 

So what was the problem?  Well our room originally allocated was by the building works so we asked to be moved away from that.  And they were great and did accommodate this but you can hear the works still... . The room was very small - I appreciate that you get what you pay for and as this part of a package then that our issue but it was uncomfortably so. It is also very dark and gloomy - the design I am sure but I wouldn‚Äôt have wanted to spend too much time in here. 

The bar staff were nice, friendly and outgoing but the design is garish, will date quickly and it not a cosy place to sit.  (Dublin one the same colours if I recall and also not the nicest - but better than Belfast one) The reception area far nicer, I would apply the same design to bar area. Bar had no tomato juice and was also out of stock of several of the wines on the list.... 

Belfast has a further 3000 new hotel rooms coming over the next year and the Fitzwilliam will have to work hard to keep regulars I would suggest if they think this is what 5 star is.... 

On a positive the location was very handy. ",3,2018,02,28
226,Long weekend in Belfast,"We had an absolutely lovely stay at the Fitzwilliam. The hotel staff are excellent, attentive and very helpful during my first visit to Belfast. The hotel is beautiful, spotless, and very comfortable all around. I would stay again.",5,2018,02,28
226,*****,"The hotel is in a brilliant location and is very easy to find, the room was lovely with a very comfy bed, the staff were all excellent and definitely went above and beyond to make our stay memorable. Would highly recommend and would definitely stay again. ",5,2018,02,27
226,Newest 5* on the block...,"From the moment you walk in, the greeting is genuinely welcoming with the most comforting reception I've ever seen! Soothing tones, plush seating and a roaring modern fireplace instantly induces calm as the check-in and concierge staff alleviate any stress.

We arrived 10:30am so we expected our room not to be ready, they were happy to hold and deliver luggage to our room whilst we explored the city centre a 10min stroll away.

Newly refurbished, our room was nothing short of stunning, well equipped, large and very comfortable with a beautiful bathroom complete with complimentary toiletries and bath candle! The room was equipped with soft lighting & music system. So despite all the little touches, why do I think this falls short of it's 5* status??  

The air con controls were dated and less user friendly than most, we did have frustrating moments of trying to negotiate a happy medium. Our marble desk table had a massive crack and despite reporting our concern to reception, no acknowledgement or action was further investigated. The coffee/tea tray was inside a cupboard, heavily loaded and not on a roller shelf so if not careful, you may mistake it for a hinged draw. The entire tray had to be decanted onto the floor to get to the awkwardly stored kettle and tea cannister.

But you know what? The staff and the hotel in general offers a beautiful, stylish, modern luxurious stay and I only wish it could have been for longer but there are tiny details that falls short of a full 5* but not enough to not return again! Their acknowledgment of a special celebration alone keeps this a preferred choice for personal service and a place we will definitely come back to but do be aware that the Assembly building opposite has a very loud bell that chimes on the hour, every hour!! 

Location is fantastic, Europa bus garage 2mins walk for express bus service to BIA (direct service to Belfast International Airport), 10mins walk to centre for shopping, supermarkets, restaurants & City Hall but there are plenty of shops right outside and you can't miss the Grand Opera House next door! Car parking is via car parks payable.",4,2018,02,26
226,Girls weekend ,"The Fitzwilliam Hotel has a superb location.  We caught the No. 300 bus from Belfast international costing ¬£10.50 pp return the bus station is literally 2 mins walk away. A taxi would have cost ¬£35 each way. We were greeted by friendly, polite, professional reception staff who genuinely took an interest in our journey and our plans. Our executive suite was on the 7th floor. A beautiful room with lots of little extras. Turn down each evening with chocolates too! The hotel was immaculate. We thoroughly enjoyed our 4 night stay. We enjoyed a great room service meal. Just a couple of niggles. The shower pressure was poor perhaps due to the 7th floor? Outside our room there was a building site & they started work at 8am though the hotel can obviously not prevent this. Tea/coffee facilities were lacking in that it was tiny cartons of milk. There was a note stating you can call for fresh milk which we did most days it was just a bit of a nuisance. Overall we had a wonderful long weekend at The Fitzwilliam and would return. ",4,2018,02,26
226,Outstanding in everyway,"Completely amazing!! Room was so beautiful and modern, had the most amazing view towards cave hill, could also see Samson and Goliath from my room. We had a four course meal and breakfast.. both were lovely. Best hotel in Belfast xx",5,2018,02,26

226,"Great stay, great room, great staff - horrendous food","Just spent a night as part of the valentines package at the hotel. The room was excellent, probably the nicest I have ever stayed in. The staff where also very professional. However, the food was a real disappointment. The 3 course meal was included as part of our stay, and it was horrendous. Without a doubt the worst food I have ever been served in a restaurant. All in all, the hotel was wonderful in every way except the restaurant.",3,2018,02,25
226,Relaxation after a busy week,This trip was planned for months and was a delight. From first greetings at reception through to cocktails and then breakfast - the whole trip was brill. As for the room - wow - thank you 705 - hopefully we will see you again,5,2018,02,25

226,Fab hotel. ,Myself and my daughter stayed here on 16 to 18 feb. We had a wonderful stay. The hotel is really nice and the staff were lovely. Very friendly and always a smile to greet you when coming in or out of hotel. We had breakfast both mornings and it was delicious. Great selection and your hot breakfast is cooked to order. Rooms are really spacious and beds really comfortable. All in all a brilliant hotel and if returning to belfast would not stay anywhere else. ,5,2018,02,22
226,Super hotel,"We would definitely recommend this hotel for a city break. Thoroughly enjoyed every aspect of our stay over. Evening meal was delicious and well presented, cocktail was super, breakfast was fit for a king! Accommodation was very comfortable and we enjoyed a decent night‚Äôs sleep. ",5,2018,02,20
226,Lovely hotel but terrible nights sleep!,We had a lovely stay until 6am when we were woken by building site noise which was deafening.. poor windows did NOT keep out the noise .. hotel in great location but needs to up grade there windows for 5 star establishment ,4,2018,02,20

226,Peter is a credit to the fitzwilliam company ,"Me and my friend were sitting down having a drink late on in the fitzwilliam, the night concierge Peter brought  us our drinks and made us feel like we known him his whole life! I have stayed in hotels all around the world and Peter blew me away with his personable approach. He sat down and had a chat with us and made us feel so at home in the fitzwilliam. Peter is a credit to the company and works in a role lower than he deserves. Thank you to all the staff in the fitzwilliam but more importantly Peter for your hospitality and service.

226,Wonderful stay,"I enjoyed staying at this hotel. It is centrally located and in a safe neighbourhood. The staff were very pleasant and congenial, offering advice about where to go and what to see. Food is excellent, and rates are reasonable.",5,2018,02,19
226,Well located boutique style hotel,"As first time visitors to Belfast, the quick and easy check in and the central location made this large boutique style hotel a perfect choice. The rooms are nicely appointed (loved the extra little touches like the complimentary ear plugs), the public areas are attractively designed, and the hotel is a five minute walk from the centre, with restaurants and bars right on the doorstep. As with all our experiences of Irish hospitality, the good was elevated to the great by welcoming, helpful, enthusiastic staff. .Do cross the road for a drink at the wonderful Crown pub, and try the Harlem Cafe for a hearty breakfast in quirky and elaborate surroundings. A really good choice for a weekend base.",4,2018,02,19
226,Such a welcoming hotel,"it was our first time staying at this hotel and i can assure you it certainly will not be our last! the hotel atmosphere was so relaxing throughout our stay, we booked the Valentine package, and the attention to detail was amazing! the room was spotless and laid out beautifully, the staff were so friendly and helpful, we cannot praise them enough, no matter where we went in the hotel we were greeted with a smile and a hello. the food was absolutely amazing and presented beautifully. we look forward to our future stays here and cannot wait to return. on behalf of us both we want to thank the Fitzwilliam for a wonderful experiance!!",5,2018,02,17
226,Amazing,"Best hotel in Belfast. Will be the only one I stay at now when I am there. Located in the city centre and everything is at your ginger tips. Staff was unbelievably friendly, kind and welcoming. Just over all a great experience ",5,2018,02,16
226,Luxury Feel,"I was very impressed with the style and decor of the hotel, especially my guest room.  From the chic furniture to the enormous bathroom the whole atmosphere was luxurious.  I had delicious espresso martinis at the bar a few nights during my stay; however when the bar became more crowed the quality of my cocktail decreased.  ",4,2018,02,13
226,valentine break,"Overall we had a lovely experience at this hotel, service in the bar was a bit slow at times however to be fair it was a very busy night. I would highly recommend this hotel to anyone for the cleanliness and luxurious accommodation. Staff were very helpful.",5,2018,02,12
226,B,No complaints. Everything was perfect. Thank you for that. Will highly recommend going forward to anyone who is suggesting a stay in Belfast. All staff were very helpful and friendly and really added to the quality of the hotel.,5,2018,02,12
226,Nice hotel in a great location ,"Really nice hotel perfectly situated in the middle of everything. Stayed here on a number of occasions and all of the rooms I have been offered have been luxurious. My only complaint is that I prefer a buffet breakfast but the food offered here is excellent and the wait time is good. The hotel has a trendy vibe to the decor. The best thing about this hotel is their chauffeur, Daniel Greer. He has driven me around N. Ireland and Ireland for the last couple of years. He's extremely professional, always punctual and knowledgeable about N Ireland.",5,2018,02,11
226,No wow factor,"I wasnt very impressed with the hotel being a 5 star I expected alot better quality. Rooms were ok there was no wow factor. An extra ¬£20 for parking was outrageous. Went for a meal later in the restaurant and our starters tasted like water, the mains were ok, just ok. I wouldnt recommend it. ",3,2018,02,11
226,"Good location, classy hotel. ","Great location, attentive staff. 

Breakfast: good quality buffet choice, traditional/uncomplicated and speedily prepared menu choices too. 

Room decor was modern and functional - good range of amenities - with some tucked away - but they‚Äôre all there. 

Reception / lobby area is smart, with some interesting design features. It made for a pleasant spot to complete some work before my departure, bizarrely, sat alongside a cast member from Game Of Thrones. 

A very good hotel that I‚Äôd struggle to fault based on my stay. ",4,2018,02,10
226,Enjoyable 3 night stay,"We stayed here for a long weekend in January. All of the staff are excellent, very welcoming and friendly, but also professional. The room was spacious and quiet, with a lovely large comfortable bed. Had a few drinks in the bar one night, and the atmosphere was pleasant. The hotel is in a great location for walking around the city. Would certainly return.",5,2018,02,10
226,Fantastic bar service and cocktails ,"We loved the team in the bar. Nice service and great selection of drinks. 
Liked the bowls of nuts with the cocktails. Very nice indeed. 
I ordered a Bramble and hubby had a mojito. Then next night tried a selection of the gins. ",5,2018,02,10
226,Fantastic!,"We absolutely loved it and the location with the fantastic Robinson‚Äôs, Perch & Crown all so close by. The Fitzwilliam was a 5* experience the only thing I would change would be to make the toilet seats soft closing as I assumed it was and made a racket ha! Wonderful hotel",5,2018,02,10
226,Stunning. My favorite hotel in the world!,Fantastic hotel. The rooms are luxurious and the service impeccable. Nothing is too muich trouble and I always look forward to meeting the staff. From the check to the staff in the bar and at breakfast to the excellent concierge the focus is on making the stay a great experience. If only every hotel was like this.,5,2018,02,08
226,Middle aged couple visiting Belfast,The bedroom & foyer were nice but the bar was very dark. Staff were nice. Breakfast very expensive for 17 stg. Per person.  We thought it was more like a 4 star hotel . We were disappointed.. The food was good in the bar,3,2018,02,07
226,Look no further and live in luxury!,"In the heart of downtown Belfast is a gorgeously appointed hotel with luxurious amenities and scrumptious food! The doorman complete with victorian attire and top hat set among a modern hotel is one of the high-class hotels in all of Belfast. Exiting the elevator on our floor we walked down a dimly lit hallway with mirrored doors. As we entered our room there was a shoet hallway with a drop zone, bathroom door and closet (with robes and safe) leading to a spacious room with a king bed, sofa, desk, and enclosed mini bar. The en-suite was complete with a separate tub and shower. The heated towel rack was a plus on the winter nights! Room service, housekeeping and turn down service were impeccable. They provided bottled water every day. The only negative I could find was their use of eco-friendly tissues and toilet paper which were very rough to the touch. I wish there was a fan in the bathroom. For breakfast I ordered the room service (extra charge for service tray) salmon benedict, hot chocolate, milk and fresh fruit bowl. Perfectly poached eggs atop smoked salmon with hollandaise sauce and toasted english muffin. For dinner at the bar I ordered the tasty french onion soup with Irish soda bread and decadent sticky toffee pudding! Truly enjoying our stay as the hotel is conveniently located within walking distance to the Grand Opera House (next door), City Hall (a few blocks) and John Long's Restaurant (around the corner).",5,2018,02,06
226,Saturday Break,"Great hotel, friendly and efficient staff.Breakfast was outstanding, continental buffet and served cooked breakfast. Stayed on floor 6 overlooking  busy road and junction. Significant traffic noise make its way up to room which was a surprise to me. ",5,2018,02,06
226,Housekeeping let down overall experience,"My wife and I only stayed for one night and did not eat in the hotel. Customer facing staff were excellent. Room was a little smaller than expected but represented value for money as I received a discount for paying in advance. However our bathroom was poor, Sink very slow to drain, and lamp shades dirty, while one of the two tubes of shampoo was almost empty.",4,2018,02,06

226,Staff lovely but hotel Not 5 Star,Booked a deluxe corner room with a king size bed and got two single beds pushed together which sagged in the middle so very uncomfortable.

226,"""Twin"" rooms ridiculously small","We were terribly disappointed with our recent stay at the Fitzwilliam. Upon arrival we were checked into a double room but had booked a twin. When I rang down to reception I was told that housekeeping would be straight up to sort it out - I never imagined that this would consist of a girl moving what were 2 very small single beds, an inch apart and dressing them as 2. I rang down to reception again and asked for a proper twin room and was told someone would be along to show us to a different room. One of the ""famous"" concierge team arrived and explained that this new room would be exactly the same as the one we were leaving. On the ride down the elevator, he gave us an impromptu lecture on what a twin room consists of, concerned as he was about having to waste time showing us to a new room, he failed to offer to help us with our baggage... He was however, right about the size of the room; very small with the beds perhaps 3 inches apart and no space to walk between them, and about 1 foot from the inside bed to the wall. We gave up trying to get any satisfaction and stayed where we were. Bottom line is; do not book a twin room at the Fitzwilliam Hotel, Belfast unless you intend sleeping VERY closely to your roommate!",3,2018,01,22
226,High Qualty Establishment,"Excellent stay at the Fitzwilliam, Every need was catered for and the staff could not be more helpful. Breakfast tasted amazing and all cooked items were done to order. Slight issue around noisy busy road adjacent to window which disrupted sleep despite being on 2nd floor. Still a wonderful time had",5,2018,01,22
226,Looking forward to returning!,"Love this hotel,have stayed here a number of times. Staff are very friendly & helpful,  bedrooms are warm & very comfortable. Breakfast has waiter service, plenty of choices.
Ideal location, next door to the opera house, very handy to Gt.Victoria St train station & to the city centre.",5,2018,01,21
226,Best Stay in Belfast,The hotel room was very clean and comfortable. I don't sleep well in hotels but I slept better in the Fitzwilliam than any other hotel. I travel a lot for business so that is saying something. The staff is excellent and courteous I highly recommend this hotel. P.S. The have Guiness on tap at the bar. ,5,2018,01,21
226,A night in Belfast,"Hotel lovely and clean and generally well laid out with the exception of the dinning room which resembles an American style dinner offering little privacy or ease of access. Mainly excellent staff, let down by quality and cost of food and efficiency of bar service.",3,2018,01,20
226,Dinner let down,Dinner menu choice was poor with cheap protein options on what was an expensive package.No lamb & Smoked coley was the only fish.Portion size was tiny.Dezsert menu too was very ordinary.Not a 5 star menu when we dined,2,2018,01,17
226,Very friendly staff in lovely city,"As 2 friends we stayed here for a short break. The hotel is in a perfect position, a short walk from the city centre shops. The staff were, without exception, very helpful and friendly. The lobby is tasteful and comfortable, very welcoming. The rooms are adequate, though rather small, and a little tired, for a 5 star hotel. The  single beds were very narrow and cramped into the space, so we had to move the beds slightly. We had to ask for extra pillows. They were not in the room. A nice touch were chocolates on the pillow, provided by the night time bed turn back service. Breakfasts were tasty and cooked to order.",4,2018,01,17
226,5star break,"Service poor not up to 5star rating in both bar and restaurant- staff inattentive and more interested in chatting to each other especially in restaurant 
Wished to make reservation for 7pm brought forward to 6.30 to suit restaurant as fully booked for 7 - we were there to 7.45 alone but did not experience any rush as only4guests arrived at 7.30 - and that was full compliment in area for 30 covers -had to ask twice for glass of house red (needed to go to celler was explanation)
Room noise upsetting
Invalid facilities unsuitable for patients with right hand impairment ",2,2018,01,16
226,Excellent Hotel,"Best hotel in Belfast, best location staff, food, drinks! Everything about this hotel is excellent! 
We will certainly be back when staying in Belfast. Not many hotels in Ireland can compare to the Fitzwilliam ",5,2018,01,15
226,great hotel,"enjoyed our stay! staff are lovely, our meal was a bit of a let down! staff tried to accommadate us with another meal but it was'nt much better.next time we will eat somewhere else. rooms are very clean and comfortable",5,2018,01,15
226,Knock out,"Fantastic stay, hotel is lush as are the rooms...candle and matches next to the bath...everything you would expect plus a little bit more! Central location and extremely friendly staff!  Wouldn't stay anywhere else!",5,2018,01,15
226,Sophisticated luxury in Belfast,I love this hotel.  I have stayed here many times. I mainly travel for business purposes.  The hotel is in a great location and is very cosmopolitan.  The only downside is the lack of adequate gym facilities.  ,5,2018,01,12
226,Wife's birthday treatp,"Fantastic stay at the fitzwilliam, staff, facilities and services were all 5 star! Food was delicious and staff went the extra mile. Gerard the congiere was very friendly from the moment of arrival, showed us to our room and offer great options for places to eat close in the city centre. Will definitely stay again!",5,2018,01,11
226,Good quality city centre hotel,"We stayed in an executive double, 4th floor for weekend of 8 - 10th December, which was a big party weekend in the city with lots going on and office christmas parties everywhere so both the city and the hotel were packed. However the very lively (and noisy) bar remained good fun, the service was great, really attentive Maitre D' served us fantastic sandwiches when we arrived, starving, at 5.30 pm straight off the plane. This despite being outside of bar-snack hours and in a packed bar. Our room was large, stylish and very comfortable, luxurious even with a huge bed, a full size sofa and a really good bathroom, coffee machine, etc. Really couldn't fault it, except, on the roof of the hotel there's a large generator which makes a really loud thrumming humming noise that is clearly heard in the room below - it stopped at 7 pm and stayed off all weekend so not a big deal, but if you're there during the week and reckon on being in your room much during the day, maybe working or whatever, ask for a room on a lower floor. The hotel's also in a convenient location for everything in the city centre.  Would definitely stay there again. Expensive hotel though.",4,2018,01,11
226,Very friendly team - and spacious comfortable rooms,"Stayed overnight on a recent work trip to Belfast. 

Great welcome at reception and exceptionally quick check in. My room was very spacious, warm and with a particular comfortable bed. There was some street noise but nothing to complain about. Classical music playing from a high tech radio and music centre when I opened the room door a nice touch.

During stay had a business dinner in Fitzwilliam. Food top notch and great service from server Amy.

The overnight business rate during my stay was 120 sterling - including a generous buffet breakfast...a city centre hotel to seriously consider if visiting Belfast.",5,2018,01,10
226,Wonderful!,"My boyfriend won a free nights stay here, we were upgraded to the King Superior room which was fantastic. We parked the car outside the hotel where we were greeted and had the car parked for us and our bags brought from the car to our room after we checked ourselves in. Reception staff were very pleasant and had a good sense of humour! They gave me the impression they enjoyed working at the hotel too. üôÇ Our room was on the fifth floor, we arrived and were taken back at how beautiful the room was. The decor was fantastic and the ambience was very cool. I am an insomniac so I rarely sleep, I had gone days without sleep before staying here however last night I slept for hours in the very comfy bed! The room was extremely clean and really warm too. The shower and bath were excellent, very spacious and had shampoo / conditioner / body wash and towels provided for us. I felt so relaxed which is a rarity for me as I‚Äôm a home bird! We went down for breakfast this morning and were very impressed with the organisation and simplicity of food produce for guests, and the range of healthy food! We both had the Fitzwilliam fry, tea and coffee, fruit, cereal, juice and smoothies in these quirky little bottles. The staff were so pleasant for that time of the morning and were very presentable too. Overall I had a fantastic stay here and would love to return sometime.‚ò∫Ô∏è Thankyou!",5,2018,01,10
226,amazing stay,"My husband and I received a gift voucher for this hotel so we decided to take in the titanic tour as well. We arrived at the Hotel and Matthew was on the front desk very helpful and upgraded us to the 6th floor room 602 amazing view and unbelievable room.

We had dinner booked as part of the package I wasn't over impressed with the menu there wasn't a great variety. We had to pay 8 pounds per person for the beef. The only saving factor for the dining experience was Aidan he was unbelievable so helpful and such a lovely man. We have stayed in many Hotels My husband was very impressed with Aidan. We will definitely be back. Aidan thanks for saving the day !!.",5,2018,01,10
226,Excellent,"Excellent hotel, staff and location. Personally the food was not to our taste but staff were very accommodating in helping us find elsewhere. We will be back as soon as we can for another relaxing break away",5,2018,01,09
226,An amazing stay for my 40th birthday!," I stayed with the hotel on sat 6th Jan. There was a group of 18 of my family and friends. The staff were so friendly and helpful, rooms were beautifully decorated, and breakfast was the best i've had!",5,2018,01,08
226,Loved with FitzWilliam,"The FitzWilliam is in a lovely location, has very pretty decor in lobby and rooms and has the best concierge I've ever dealt with...Philip...he should get a raise.  We spent three nights there, including New Year's Eve and it was wonderful.   I highly recommend it...and it is affordable.",5,2018,01,08
226,Three Nights in Belfast,"The FitzWilliam is an affordable yet luxe hotel in a great neighborhood of Belfast.   The style and appointments in both the Lobby area and in the rooms as outstanding.   The staff was friendly and the concierge, Philip, was one of the best I've ever had the pleasure of dealing with.  Give him a raise!",5,2018,01,08
226,One Night only,"Stayed overnight (Friday 5 January 2018). Reasonably sized room (seventh floor) with a good view of Belfast, good facilities and very comfortable bed. Nice to have a bath plus separate walk-in shower. My wife enjoyed a long soak in the bath while I appreciated the power of the shower. We were a little disappointed with the food choices in the bar. On reflection we could have fared better in one of the many superb restaurants in and around the city centre. The staff are very helpful and friendly and helped make our stay memorable. We would recommend this hotel and hope to return soon.",4,2018,01,08
226,"Beautiful hotel, with very friendly staff, but let down by noise from next room & soul-less bathroom!","lovely hotel, very friendly staff and excellent service. But our room had an adjoining door that meant we could hear our neighbours (and no doubt they could hear us). And the bathroom for our room was more of a soul-less ""wet room"" with very minimalist shelving, knee high tiny sink, no hooks to hang things, no shower curtain or screen: The room had no doubt been designed for reduced mobility / wheelchairs but surely even these special facilities could have been designed with a little more warmth, charm and ""5 star hotel"" spirit in mind? ",3,2018,01,08
226,Fabulous,"Visited Belfast recently  and stayed at this hotel in a superior room
Well located in the city and very comfortable
Large room/ separate seating area/ large bathroom with walk in shower and jacuzzi bath- very well appointed
My only reservation was the lack of a PowerPoint near the mirror for styling my hair
Food really good- especially in the bar and lovely helpful staff especially the concierge team
Would  highly recommend",5,2018,01,07
226,Great Hotel,Had an overnight stay in this lovely hotel in a great central location . The staff were super friendly I work within travel hospitality and all staff I encountered were fantastic so welcoming and helpful. The room was really nice with attention to detail . I had breakfast which was a great start to the day. Looking forward to staying again . ,5,2018,01,07
226,Great Location but..,"Kind of a mixed bag, a super location, nice staff and a lovely corner room. The hotel bar and dining room are 3 star standard though, the food was ok but would suggest to eat in some of the super restaurants close by, Deane‚Äôs or James St South are definitely worth booking.",3,2018,01,07
226,Belfast City break,"This has to be the best Hotel I have visited.
There is no rock been left unturned in the way this hotel is managed and run.
Modern conteproray design fantastic finishing touches throughout the whole hotel.

226,A bit of Luxury,"A beautiful hotel, luxurious and comfortable. Every room you enter has that little extra touch. The staff are so well presented in uniform and so friendly. 
Will return again and make it my base in future when in Belfast. Luxury at an affordable price",5,2018,01,06
226,Beautiful Hotel,"We stayed here just a few days before Christmas and the decor was fabulous. The bedroom was comfortable and very well equipped with snacks, drinks and any utilities you may need. We ate in the bar on both days and the food was delicious. We also had some fantastic cocktails there!üç∏ All staff we encountered were friendly and helpful - from reception, to bar staff, to breakfast serving staff. Would definitely recommend the Fitzwilliam Belfast for a luxury hotel break. ",5,2018,01,05
226,Not a five star experience,"My daughter had booked this for me a a girlie treat. We were directed to the bar which was dark and dreary. Eventually when I found a staff member I asked if we could go to the foyer as shown on the hotel's website. We were told that we should have asked for this at time of booking. This was the first time we had been told this. 
We relocated and we were brought an amuse bouche of soup and sausage rolls. The soup which was leek and potato was so salty we couldn't drink it. Also very salty was the egg mayonnaise sandwich again inedible
Thank goodness for the scones which were great and so were the the cakes
This is a competitive market in Belfast and there are alot of places nearby that do a better afternoon tea so I feel that the Fitzwilliam will need to up its game both in food quality and service",3,2018,01,04
226,Excellent!!,"Top notch service and hospitality! Friendly staff, great location, safe, clean, great food, the list goes. I was on a solo trip and the staff was helpful on reccomendations and things to do in Belfast. Highly recommend the Fitzwilliam to anyone visiting Belfast! ",5,2018,01,04
226,New Year in Belfast,"This is our 3rd visit to the Fitzwilliam and once again we were not disappointed. This is a hotel we look forward to staying in again. The location in Belfast is excellent for all amenities whether they be tourist related, food, bars and shopping. üòä",5,2018,01,03
226,Beautiful hotel,"My wife and i stayed a single night in this beautiful hotel which is in a great location. 

The service was friendly and welcoming and not at all pretentious. 

My only complaint was the traffic noise (what did i expect from a city centre hotel) but i did wonder if the windows were soundproofed as much as they could have been",4,2018,01,03
226,Book the Hilton save some cash!,"Well where to begin, this place is a joke. Dark corridors on every floor. Reception is fabulous, gorgeous decor but that is where it ends.
Concierge- great and friendly.

Bar- crowded screeching singer and sloppy, tired staff spilling drinks and tripping over chair legs. Over priced and cocktails thrown together any old mixture will do it seems

Restaurant- Dull atmosphere of gloom. Dark, depressing furnishings, red chairs from a 16th century castle keep, don't drink too much or you will be landing on your back. Our server smelt of smoke, muttered his words and had no clue what sauce was on each dish, he had to read our menus for each item we inquired about. Drinks came one by one minutes apart, terrible. 

I have stayed in five star hotels, this is not five star, buffet for breakfast was awful its minuscule and average. The best part about the hotel was the room view, which shows a lovely city away from this place!

Would I return, def not 2/10",2,2018,01,03
226,Fabulous,"Excellent location adjacent to Opera House, GVSt train/ coach station
Taxi/ coach access from airport
Clean
Lovely, spacious rooms
Easy access to High Street
Breakfast decent spread
Nearby Tesco 
TV could offer better channel options",5,2018,01,03
226,"Great staff, friendly and comfortable","The Fitzwilliam is a good place to be - it's central and the rooms are large, clean, comfortable. Staff is very friendly and polite. 
As an Austrian living in a tourist spot I know what a breakfast buffet can offer - Fitzwilliam's isn't very breath-taking, especially for a 5-star-hotel, sorry to say. 
The bar is a nice place to spend time at before bed time. Nevertheless, the young staff there was not the quickest and used glasses and bottles covered one end of the bar. 
It was our 2nd time at the Fitzwilliam and we can recommand it and hope to maybe come back a 3rd time one day.",4,2018,01,03
226,A special hotel in a special city,This is a hotel that will make you feel like royalty. An outstanding welcome from an excellent team of staff. Always helpful and always smiling. The location is perfect for exploring this amazing city. I would highly recommend this hotel to anyone wanting a really special experience ,5,2018,01,03
226,Almost 5 star ,"We had an amazing room for a 2 night stay including NYE,  though the contrast with the decor of the public areas is quite stark, I found it a bit odd that they‚Äôre so different. We booked a NYE dinner package - dinner was ok but the only nod to it being NYE was a chap with a laptop playing music in the bar - quite disappointing. Because of this as well as the long wait for 4 drinks on both evenings, we left and found nice local bars instead, (but I would also say in fairness that our cocktails mid afternoon were wonderful and served within a few minutes). Breakfast items in cold buffet not replenished an hour before end of breakfast timing on 1st morning was also an issue. Overall it‚Äôs a lovely place and we experienced some amazing service whilst we were there from two Concierges and reception staff who were warm welcoming and very helpful and efficient and the housekeeping staff were friendly and thorough, but bar and restaurant needs just a wee tweak. Would still definitely return and hope to do do sometime in 2018. ",4,2018,01,02
226,First class service,We spent New Years Eve at the Fitzwilliam and stayed one night. Reception staff were very friendly. The food was top notch. I can‚Äôt fault anything about this hotel. Each time I stay at this hotel it‚Äôs always the best experience. Will see you again soon Fitzwilliam. Thank you for an amazing time.,5,2018,01,02
226,Fantastic Christmas stay,"We stayed here for Christmas for 4 nights whilst visiting family. The rooms are great, the bed is amazing and the bathroom is huge. The staff are unobtrusive but helpful when you need them. We were delighted to wake up on Christmas morning to a lovely big stocking from the hotel, it was such a lovely touch and very much appreciated. This is our second stay at The Fitzwilliam and I would highly recommended the hotel  and would stay here again. The location is fab with the center of Belfast only a short walk away and lots of bars/restaurants near by.",5,2018,01,02
226,My Stay at the Fitzwilliam Belfast,"I ordered dinner and dessert at the Fitzwilliam which was delicious although the portion sizes were too small. The iron in my room was also faulty and I had to bring it to reception to get a replacement. Also, I prefer to use the stairs than the lift and every time I used the stairs a member of staff had to open the fire door at the top of the stairs. On the evening of my stay a blonde girl at reception with an Australian accent refused to open the fire door at the top of the stairs for me, so this was a negative part of my stay in this hotel.",3,2018,01,02
226,Superior hotel in interesting Belfast,Visited Belfast for the first time and chose the Fitzwilliam Hotel on a recommendation.   The hotel is very nice with a friendly and helpful tram.  We organised sightseeing and dinner reservations via Philip the concierge and he and the rest of his team were amazing.   He organised a guide for us (Daniel Greer) who was perfect.  Our trip was made immensely better because the concierge team was so good.  Bar staff and restaurant team were also very friendly and helpful.   ,5,2018,01,02
226,Festive Afternoon Tea.....barely festive at all!,"My cousin and I recently went for Afternoon Tea and had booked for the Festive Afternoon Tea Option as it was Christmas time.  When my cousin arrived she was told the only options of where to have the tea was in the lobby area or the bar - neither of which was ideal as it was winter and the lobby had the main doors always opening and the bar just didn't have the right atmosphere for Afternoon Tea as its a bar and has no windows so was very dark.  Since it was cold in the lobby we opted for the bar as there was no other option. We informed the waiter that we had booked the Festive Tea and based on the website it offered a few festive options in terms of sandwiches like turkey and cranberry etc. We were offered a beverage to start which could be mulled wine or a non alcoholic option so this was at least festive.  Sadly the first dish of sandwiches arrived all laid out on a plate - thick fingers, nothing fancy and options were ham, ham and cheese, or chicken and mayo.  There was also a small soup and sausage roll on the side.  When we received the sweet options there was a mince pie at least however the presentation was very poor with some of the desserts squashed and stuck together. Also there was very few tea options offered which was also a shame.

Overall we were both very disappointed, not only were we sold incorrect information on the website at the time of booking but the atmosphere and presentation only further disappointed us and before we were even finished our tea people were packing into the bar (as it was a Friday) and were coming to party/have drinks etc and we therefore couldn't even hear each other speaking.  I expect that in a bar and that was fine but shouldn't be where you have afternoon tea...it just doesn't work!

On a positive the staff were polite and provided a good service however they were doing their job and it wasn't their fault the location and Afternoon Tea experience was not as expected and highly regrettable.",2,2018,01,02
226,Shopping trip,Wet on arrival and meet at car by concierge and escorted indoors with umbrella Checked in and escorted to room which was warm and comfortable work everything perfect. Went to bar and ordered a couple of cocktails which were beautiful to drink and entertaining to watch the barman making After a great night the breakfast the next morning  was delicious ,5,2017,12,31
226,SImply and comfortable,"Nights away are far and few for us. so booking a nice hotel every now and then is a must for 2 working parents! We are a simple couple and honestly the staff couldn't have been better, they told us what they had to offer and left it to us! some hotels we have stayed with couldn't be bothered with you but here they had so much to offer! will most diff be returning and very much worth the money the rooms are immaculate the bed is to die for and the extras well! just perfect! it is pricy but worth every penny!

226,Superb Fitzwilliam,"A luxurious, relaxing stay at The Fitzwilliam. The staff, the room, the service all faultless. We have stayed a few times at The Fitzwilliam and in the past have had a few issues but the Hotel has really upped it's game and every aspect of our stay was as I said "" faultless"" . Returning guests are made to feel special with a very warm hearty welcome. The food as ever was beautiful well presented with an excellent level of service. This is a hotel you will just keep coming back to because of how it makes you feel, total relaxation.",5,2017,12,31
226,Family trip,"Went with 2 adults & 3 children, in interconnecting rooms. Rooms are spacious & modern. We were at the back, not a great view but away from the noise of a busy road, which I preferred. Staff are extremely friendly, service a bit slow in restaurants but food is good. Location is great, lots of great restaurants within walking distance. Titanic quarter is a taxi ride away. Would highly recommend this hotel & would stay here again.",5,2017,12,31
226,Wonderful stay,"We really enjoyed our stay, excellent service, food and lovely rooms.

Only negative was the cost of parking, at ‚Ç¨45 for two nights, I found this to be quite expensive, however there was an excellent valet service.",5,2017,12,31

226,One night escape,"Fantastic hotel, staff were very friendly and helpful. Would definitely recommend. Breakfast was excellent. Cocktails at the bar were good and reasonably priced. WiFi worked well throughout the hotel.",5,2017,12,29
226,One of those...not really sure!!!,"This is an interesting one. In some ways a great hotel but in others very poor. Rooms very good although ensure you ask for floor 6 plus or in a lot of cases you are looking at walls as your view. Staff very friendly and attentive. I have my concerns though that this hotel is struggling. Is it a franchise? At peak time of the year they had no Guinness, Hophouse and on our 2nd night ran out of a premium cider! Surely not! I have never been in a hotel that this has happened anywhere in the world. Whats worse is Diageo is at most 10 mins from the hotel? Poor show owners of Fitzwilliam with one of Irelands premium beers! Rooms expensive although probably premium rates due to time of year. Would I stay again.....really not sure!Need to be convinced!",3,2017,12,28
226,Fitzwilliam Hotel Belfast,Amazing hotel. Just walking into the lobby was exciting! Stayed in the studio suite which unlike most places is exactly what you see in the pictures.

226,Personable staff at the Fitzwilliam,"Valet parking on arrival was a first for me and it was both welcome and efficient. Checking in took seconds and the staff were efficient and personable in equal measure. We were shown around our room, which was the executive king room, and left to relax in the luxury of it. Well stocked minibar although we didn‚Äôt avail of it. Quiet room with minimal city traffic noise and a seriously comfortable bed. It has been my best hotel experience to date and I can‚Äôt praise it enough. ",5,2017,12,24

226,The stuff that nightmares are made of,"Stayed here with my friend Sharon for a birthday treat and some xmas shopping. Where do I begin. We arrived at 3pm on Saturday and were wowed by the entrance and the lobby area but thats were it ends. We were on 6th floor it was dimmly lit and there was a fowl smell of wetness or dampness in our corridor it never left. We decided to chill and go for dinner around 7pm this was absolutely chaotic. A male host told us he could cram us in as they were quite busy, we were seated in a darkened booth and 2 menus were slapped down, we waited around 12 mins on our drinks to arrive after ordering with a slobby waiter. Hardly setting the glass on table it nearly toppled over my friends phone. We decided to go straight for mains as the service was very slow and amatuer. We ordered two medium rare steaks. They came after around 30mins and were medium well, BOTH of them! we were left very unhappy and when we told the guy who was our server he rolled his eyes and made it out as if we were telling lies we could not believe it, we paid and left hastily. Definately not a five star experience, train your staff and invest in some housekeepers and an electrician
TERRIBLE!",2,2017,12,22
226,"Gorgeous hotel, enjoyed every minute!","Really beautiful hotel, decor was stunning. We arrive daily by car and there was a lovely man who helped you get all bags in.

226,hotel was not up to the standard i expected,"stayed at this hotel to do a bit of light shopping and was expecting after the cost to get a high standard experience but was very disappoint, were the entrance is grand and beautiful to the hotel the room was not..... it was cramped and the window was directly in view of someone else room witch made it impossible to get any privacy with out the curtains completely pulled, but the biggest fault was the bed , it goes with out saying i have stayed in quite a few rooms but this was by fare the most uncomfortable bed i slept in in a long time, it was that bad i got up a 4:30am packed my bag and left the hotel. now saying that the only possitve were the staff as the man cheaking me out asked why i was leaveing and after explaining the situation they offered me a free breakfast but after the price i paid i would of expected more, i was not a happy chappy at all",2,2017,12,21
226,Good location and very nice place,"I visited here in late November.  I had several emails with concierge before arrival and he was most helpful in making some arrangements in advance for me that turned out great.

However the front desk manager quickly jumped at the issue, upgraded us to a larger and most importantly cleaner room.

226,Favourite Hotel of our Ireland Experience,"This Hotel was in a great location, close walk from Train Station and to the Christmas Markets.  

The hotel is a beautiful boutique Hotel with really great staff, in particular the bar staff and the concierge!

Our room and bathroom were really lovely, clean and comfortable and each night they turned down the bed and gave us chocolates.  We also got given complimentary water which we found rare in Ireland.  Then there was the box of cards, mints, earplugs etc.  Just those extras make you feel welcome and special.

The bar staff were run off their feet but always made us feel that they were looking after us and never forgot about us.  I loved my blackberry in my prosecco :-)  

On our last night we received some devastating news whilst in the bar and the front staff were very understanding, caring and helpful.  

Thank you for looking after us, our stay was amazing and we hope that one day we can return to your great city!",5,2017,12,19
226,Great place to stay,"Suituated in a convenient location to all main attractions shopping, restaurants bars etc, All is as expected from a 5star hotel except the quality of breakfast coffee and orange juice. Only negative I can think of and an easy fix for the hotel ! ",4,2017,12,19
226,Dark ! Confusing fussiness with great service,"This is a nice hotel if somewhat fussy rather than offering excellent service

It is expensive for what it is

I find both the public rooms and bedrooms to be on the dark side - ok for some things , but rubbish for shaving for example !",4,2017,12,19
226,Very good,"Hotel was very good. Good breakfast, service was very professional, room was extremely tidy. Great location it‚Äôs verh close to all shops and other facilities. Check in and out was very simple. Great restaurant ",4,2017,12,19

226,First class hotel,"This is the first time we stayed at the Fitzwilliam hotel Belfast and it was superb. Rooms are gorgeous, spacious beautifully set out, big king size bed, sofa, plenty of space for clothes. Great bathroom, what a shower and love the candle for the bath. 
It was lovely when we came in after a show to find the beds turned down, chocolates on the pillows and water and glasses on the lockers. Breakfast was great, wonderful selection of hot and cold food.

226,Belfast Shopping and Markets,"My Favourite Hotel, rooms dining were to a high standard. All the staff were very friendly and efficient great location with parking we had the offer of ¬£15 per night for car. 
My only complaint Bar waiter/ess far to slow due to this we only managed 2 drinks in the hour when we would have liked 4.",5,2017,12,14
226,Outstanding ,"From the moment we arrived to the moment we left we were treated like family.
The room (deluxe) was amazing. It was clean, comfortable and well kitted out.
Cleaning staff did a marvelous job every day and the turn down service with the little box of chocolates was a wonderful touch.
You will hear a fair amount of noise from the cars outside but this is not something that bothered us at all.

Belfast has a lot to offer but as someone who suffers a fair bit with anxiety and panic attacks it‚Äôs important that I have a secure surrounding to return to and this is where I just can‚Äôt praise the staff higher. The bar staff in particular was so friendly, attentive and thoughtful and it felt like there was nothing they wouldn‚Äôt sort out for us, and that‚Äôs without them knowing anything about my anxiety, that‚Äôs just how they are.
The drinks were delicious and the food tasty.
There was a wedding party there one night and that‚Äôs the only time I could see them falling behind slightly on time as there was also a lot of people in there due to other events nearby.

We will return and it will be soon.
Thank you.",5,2017,12,13

Thank you!,5,2017,12,13
226,Poor breakfast experience,"An excellent stay was marred on the last day by having to wait 35 mins to get a table for breakfast.  When it then came, the server forgot the toast which we never got.  Also instead therefore of sitting down to eat at 1010 hrs, we never ate until close to 1100 hrs by which time the buffet had been well picked over and there wasn‚Äôt much left.  Finally the delay in getting breakfast meant we missed our train home.  Clearly they can‚Äôt cope with the capacity wanting Sunday morning breakfasts. Spoilt an otherwise good stay.",4,2017,12,12
226,Wonderful Hotel in heart of Belfast,"We stayed at the Fitzwilliam for 2 nights in early December.  Everything was first rate.

226,"Disappointing 2 night stay., definitely not 5 star.","Very disappointing 2 days at this 5 star hotel. Very poor service. Main bar very loud and noisy and had very loud music. Breakfast was good but service poor with dirty dishes left in front of us to the point we had to clear them ourselves. No availability for an evening meal unless you had booked. Had food in the bar, very poor service, had to remind staff 3 times before we eventually got our drinks.",2,2017,12,12
226,"No parking, 30 min wait for lunch to find it hadn't been submitted to kitchen!","On arrival we were informed our allocated parking slot had been given to someone else, having to go and park at the bus station carpark overnight!!On returning from parking we ordered lunch!

226,Overnight stay,"Excellent service from all staff, great breakfast and room was immaculate. Bathroom well equipped.Everyone was very helpful and approachable. Only downside was the charge for hot port at the bar(¬£6.50 each)",5,2017,12,10
226,Met up with family ,"We met up with family and stayed for 2 nights! Check in was very fast, we were put in an accessible room which wasn‚Äôt suitable for us(we didn‚Äôt know this at time of check in)My husband is tall and the sink was nearly by his knees so we had to be moved. First of all they asked for more money to be moved which I refused as I hadn‚Äôt booked that room so I didn‚Äôt need to pay any more!
They did finally agree and we were moved promptly and the second room was very good. The bed is very comfortable and we had an enjoyable stay. 
The lobby is cold as the door keeps opening and you have to sit there with your coat on and also I found the bar quite intimidating on Friday night as there was lots of security at the door as there was a Christmas party going on and I felt like I‚Äôd walked into a private function.
Apart from those things I had a lovely stay!",4,2017,12,10

- the floor was dirty and was not hoovered from the guest before
- there was a lot off dust on the bathroom floor
- the carpet was not even tight to the wall in areas.

2)  On Sunday night we went into the bar and order a gin and tonic and a 7 up. we ordered it twice and after it didn't come after 15 mins on the 2nd order we just got up and left.

3) we ordered the room service for Monday morning.
- i ordered a latte which when it came up was cold.
-m i then tried to make my own coffee in the room and the coffee machine was not working.
- My girlfriend is pregnant at the min and ordered sausages which were not cooked through.

226,Perfect from start too finish.,Staff here are an absolute credit too the hotel. From check in to check out they couldn't have made our stay any better. They made us feel like royalty greeted by every staff member we walked by. Asked what our plans are for the day and if we need any information. We arrived early and the room was ready by 12.30 which was brilliant as check in isn't supposed to be until 3. The concierge helped us with our luggage and was so polite. The room was perfect haven't slept so comfortably in my life. We went to dinner in the restaurant and the food was out on the table pretty much as soon as we ordered it. The chef here is brillant absolutely gorgeous food. Waiting staff were also brilliant. While we were out for dinner a house keeper had been into our room cleaned it left fresh towels and a turndown service. Which was a lovely touch when we weren't expecting it. Even after we had been shopping in the Christmas markets the concierge took our bags too the car for us so we didn't have to carry them upstairs. Reception were brilliant my girlfriend left her coat in the hotel after check out and we realised the next day when unpacking our bags. I called the hotel and they posted it out the same day.

226,A Walkers Paradise,"The Fitzwilliam could not have a better location. It is within a half block of the beautiful Opera House on one of Belfast's main shopping streets.

226,5 Star Service and Customer Care,"We visited the Fitzwilliam Hotel, Belfast during the October Mid-Term Break, we travelled as a family of 2 Adults and 2 children.  We phoned en-route at about mid-day to enquire as to what time our room would be available and the lovely girl on reception informed us that our room was ready and to come straight there.  This got our holiday off to a great start, we followed the excellent directions on the website and had no problem locating it.  From that initial phone call our stay was 5 star all the way.  From the valet service on arrival, the seamless check-in, the friendly and efficient bar and restaurant staff, the spacious rooms with the most amazing turn down service and the concierge team who are just outstanding - we just could not fault any aspect of our stay.  Belfast is a great city and we really appreciated the advice from the concierge team to return to the hotel before 7pm to enjoy the Halloween fireworks from the comfort of our corner window bedroom.  
Fantastic Location, Beautiful Hotel and the friendliest, most accommodating and pleasant staff we have ever had the pleasure of meeting .  They genuinely care and it shows.  It's evident that the various departments within the hotel are all working together to deliver superior service to the customer.  It's a very polished and professional service but both welcoming and friendly.  This was our first time to stay at the Fitzwilliam yet the staff made us feel like old friends.  We really are looking forward to returning to the Fitzwilliam, Belfast in the not too distant future, we thoroughly enjoyed our stay.  ",5,2017,11,29

226,A very pleasant stay,"Delightful stay. Beautiful rooms, very comfortable though very masculine decor. Very helpful and attentive staff.

Overall an excellent stay. ",5,2017,11,27
226,Afternoon Tea,"Myself and 3 friends had arranged to meet for afternoon tea yesterday in this hotel. Having previously stayed in this hotel, I really liked the interior and decor. We were told to go upstairs to the restaurant for afternoon tea. We received a glass of champagne and then awaited our food. For being the only ones there, I felt we had to wait for longer than we should have. The food arrived but no plates, we had to ask for plates, but in order to ask for the plates one of my friends had to get up and go look for someone as the staff were not easily tracked beside our table. My friend then had to get up to find someone to ask for cream with our scones. The food itself was fine. The sandwiches felt slightly stale as if the bread had been sitting out and not covered for a while. 
Overall I wouldn't be rushing back as I have had better afternoon teas.",3,2017,11,26

226,Fantastic stay,"A fantastic stay in a fantastic hotel!

We were greeted by some of the friendliest reception staff I have come across in a long time. They even asked if we needed any recommendations on places to eat etc. 

The room was beautifully decorated with a bathroom to die for! The location of the hotel is perfect for those who are going for a weekend away or just a shopping trip. 

While there is no on-site parking there is a carpark right across the way which is ¬£16 for an overnight stay when stamped by reception at the hotel. 

The only flaw we had with the hotel was despite filling out the breakfast menu the night before we were only giving some of the items we selected and the breakfasts were very small and we also asked for a room with a view however we were overlooking what seemed to be offices. 

I am already planning my next trip!",5,2017,11,22
226,Too expensive,"Over priced for the room itself, for one night! The room was lovely but far too expensive. Great location! Only 10 minutes too the city centre! Not much they offered in the hotel whilst staying with them, would go again if room was on offer ",3,2017,11,22
226,Highly recommended,"This is a lovely hotel that's really centrally located. All of the staff were incredible and our room was large and very well designed.  My only critiques were the pillows weren't great and while the bathroom was super cool, the lighting was very dim. That said, I'd certainly stay here again. ",5,2017,11,22
226,Weekend retreat,"This is our 4th time to the Fitzwilliam, so we are well accustomed to the friendly and efficient service of all their staff. The bedrooms are really comfortable and fully equipped for a wonderful nights sleep. We ate in the restaurant for dinner and breakfast and the food on both occasions was top class. The decor of the  restaurant has become dated but I presume this will get updated over the coming months as they have recently updated their bedrooms and reception area. Excellent location for walk into city center. 
Overall wonderful stay as always in the Fitzwilliam. ",5,2017,11,22
226,Convenient and accomodating,"Fitzwilliam was recommended to me by a colleague. They are central to everything, nice and helpful at every step. It's a place that feels sophisticated for adults. They also have nice meeting facilities on their top floor with nice views.",5,2017,11,21
226,Excellence at every turn,"2 nights in this hotel spoiled us for any other city venue. From start to finish the standard was excellent. A gorgeous room, property serviced and well trained staff for whom nothing was too much trouble. Just how a hotel should be. We‚Äôll be back for sure.",5,2017,11,21
226,Great place,Lovely lazy sunday package. Shop some culture...great food...lovely nightcap..and comfy bed. Watch the shower...need longer bath mat..bit slippery. Really enjoyed the quiet night away but not far from home,5,2017,11,21
226,Birthday weekend,"Hotel was lovely, but we were initially overcharged at check in only I corrected the trainee receptionist. We received 3 biscuits as a complimentary gift for my husbands birthday, in other Belfast hotels we received complimentary upgrades or complimentary bottle of Processo. The shower pressure was awful. I think this hotel is overrated to be honest.",3,2017,11,20
226,Brilliant Stay,Really couldn't recommend this hotel enough.  I could not fault the service or the staff.  Everyone was friendly and helpful and the food was delicious!  Beautifully clean and the bedtime chocolates were a lovely touch!,5,2017,11,20
226,Opera stay,"Tried lots of hotels in the city, this tops the lot. Room fantastic , glass wall window in it was epic.  Service was top notch. 5 star. Location was ideal for the grand opera house visit. We had a brilliant stay.",5,2017,11,19
226,Brilliant Hotel,Stayed here in August on a romantic break with herself to Belfast. Great Hotel for a treat or a special occasion. Centrally located with gorgeous bedrooms and good staff. Unfortunately we didnt dine here as we wanted to try other restaurant in the city but i can recommend the cocktails.,5,2017,11,19
226,Simply fantastic with that Irish charm,"I arrived her on Thursday night very clean everywhere had been freshly painted very modern stunning new carpets. The staff could not do enough for me after realising I had become bedridden with a severe chest infection, I was brought up food and tea and they ensured there was a car park reserved for me as I am disabled. Another lady came in angry that there was not enough spaces but there is a massive sign stating that an overflow carpark was available across the road at a cost of just over 4 euros for 24 hours. This is not their car park but they have managed to get this cheap deal which I think is cheap for parking. They do allow customers to park in the disabled bays but they also inform then that when it is needed for somebody they will be asked to move. 

I would highly recommend this hotel just simply for the service..mishaps happen everywhere but we take them as they come nothing is perfect in life but for the cost of the rooms the cleanliness, the service, the ambiance I am very very comfortable given my deteriorated health here. 

Thank you so much for making me feel a lot better.",5,2017,11,19
226,A brilliant stay,"Hotel great, very central for the city. Staff were very friendly and polite. The breakfasts were brilliant and well cooked (I had a Fitzwilliam Fry - twice!) The rooms were well fitted out and the bed very comfortable.",5,2017,11,19
226,Excellent,Very nice boutique hotel with excellent service. Luxurious and comfortable with very friendly staff who are extremely helpful. Great location within walking distance of pretty much everything with valet parking also - there's a car park across the street as well. Would highly recommend for both business and pleasure trips! ,5,2017,11,19
226,Nice hotel - let down by breakfast and parking,"Hotel is beautifully decorated and a real treat for anyone wanting to stay centrally in Belfast. We were not told when we arrived that the car park costs ¬£20 for the night even for guests (nearby car park costs less). Breakfast was the biggest disappointment, with very limited options for coeliacs. Things like gluten free toast was of the poorest quality bread on the market. ",3,2017,11,19
226,Pauine Yeo,Had a lovely  4 days staying  here  small problem with traffic noise  in first room but was quickly  sorted  out for us by a nice young man on reception.  Looking forward to  our next stay in April. Can throughly  recommend  staying  at the Fitzwilliam  Hotel Belfast.,5,2017,11,19
226,Somewhere to make you feel special,Excellent Staff and very comfortable Hotel in a very convenient situation.Nothing is too much trouble ..right from arrival our car was taken and parked .Reception staff made me feel relaxed from the start ..Dining room staff met our every request ..,5,2017,11,18
226,Excellent,"I stayed here for two nights and really enjoyed my stay. All the staff were pleasant and helpful. The only downsides were the room corridors are quite dark, but I suppose that is part of the hotel style and the dinner menu was extremely limited. But there are nearby restaurants, so not a problem. I would definitely recommend this hotel and I will be returning.  ",5,2017,11,17
226,Work Visit,"Good service, environment, location. close to good restaurants. Close to shopping and site seeing. Price are appropriate regarding the service. Restaurant can be improved, but it's good enough.
Acceptable and recommendable.",4,2017,11,17
226,"Great stay, efficient hotel, leave workout clothes at home","Very attentive staff, nice modern rooms and a nice bar. Enjoyed my first stay in Belfast and will certainly come back. The gym room is bad news but they will offer a cheap daily pass to another place nearby which is reasonable.",4,2017,11,16
226,A very nice one,We went to visit Belfast and The Fitz was the best choice for the city. We had a lovely room with a stunning view over the town. The staff has done an amazing job. Especially the ladies from housekeeping. The highlight of our days was the turn down service because it came with such amazing pralines!!! We are visiting the sister hotel in Dublin by the end of this month so let¬¥s see if they as great as Belfastteam. Thank¬¥s very much for your hospitality,5,2017,11,15
226,Best hotel in Belfast,Another excellent stay in The Fitzwilliam in Belfast.  The room was up to the usual excellent standard of comfort and cleanliness with excellent luxurious bedding and linen.  It is always a pleasure to stay here and I am already looking forward to my next visit.  ,5,2017,11,15
226,Perfect,Stayed just for one night and the hotel was perfect. Good choice for room service and meal arrived on time and was lovely. Room had everything you need and was very clean. Bed was very comfortable and room was spotless.,5,2017,11,15
226,Small criticisms of otherwise lovely stay,"My husband and I were given a voucher by our family as a present. This enabled us to stay in a suite. The concierge and reception staff were again, professional and courteous. Our minor criticisms are of the restaurant where we had our evening meal. We were initially greeted politely but once seated were referred to as 'guys' on more than one occasion. I appreciate that this may appear trivial but it tended to detract from the overall experience.

My main reason for complaint is that another guest 'vaped' during their meal. The smell was not overly strong but was obvious and unpleasant. Whilst I prefer not to see vaping at all, to see it in a Restaurant is particularly distasteful. We did mention this occurrence to the restaurant manager when asked if everything had been alright with our meal. His response was  'it was allowed'. I would strongly urge management to consider the implications of permitting this practice. 

Despite this incident, we enjoyed our stay and will certainly return.",4,2017,11,14
226,Not a good value for money,"This review is does not reflect on my hotel stay but is about the tour I did with Daniel Greer that the concierge at the hotel arranged.

I regret to say that my tour was not at all worth the ¬£180.00 that I paid. I booked what I think would be regarded as a full day tour that I was on the understanding was suppose to last from 07:00-15:00, with Daniel Greer picking me up form the hotel and dropping me off at Belfast station.

However this was not what occurred because Daniel Greer dropped me off at 14:00 at Belfast train station but my train was not till: 16:00 hours so there would have been plenty of time had he dropped me at 15:00 as advertised. 

he also hurried me when when I was viewing a museum during this tour when there was actually plenty of time and no rush to catch my train, so the tour was not at all enjoyable.",1,2017,11,14
226,Wonderful one night stay in the city,Fantastic one night break for two old friends who only meet once a year. Stay superb from start to finish -upgraded upon arrival! Hotel so clean and well presented. Room exceptional. Friendly staff and breakfast first class. Will recommend and return!,5,2017,11,14
226,Perfection,"from the entrance throughout the Hotel everything is perfect. Beautiful decor, clean rooms, delicious breakfast and staff excellent. Front desk staff friendly and efficient. Hotel is centrally situated. value for money!
will definitely recommend!!
thank you for a wonderful stay.",5,2017,11,14
226,"Beautiful Hotel , perfect location ",Three night stay in a beautiful hotel . The staff are very friendly and the food in the hotel is gorgeous . Thoroughly enjoyed our stay and will definitely be back . Location is perfect. We stayed in room 308 and is was quiet and comfortable ,5,2017,11,13
226,Poor,"Did not feel we got value for money. The room was not of great quality, noise levels were shocking as we were in an adjoining room which made no sense. Please be more mindful of this when assigning rooms",3,2017,11,13
226,Good but not cheap,Very nice in many ways but to be a real luxury hotel as it claims it needs to improve how it handles the small stuff - ran out of several food/drink items over weekend; quality of fittings not great and had to call repair man. But the service was very good and it‚Äôs in a great location. ,4,2017,11,13
226,Weekend treat,"A great hotel, relaxing and welcoming, I have stayed before in this hotel and have always found it an enjoyable experience for all concerned.
The hotel is centrally located to all local amenities, hope to revisit soon",5,2017,11,13
226,Friendly staff and lovely hotel.,"We stayed for two nights over the weekend. 

All members of staff throughout our stay were incredibly friendly and helpful. 

Room was spacious, cleaned regularly and supplied with everything we could need. 

Great central location.

Breakfast had a good hot and cold selection and was very tasty.

Bar staff were helpful and selection was good. 

Lovely cosy lobby with great door staff.

No complaints what so ever. ",5,2017,11,13
226,Top Class,"I visited the Fitzwilliam Hotel in Belfast this weekend with friends and couldn‚Äôt have been happier in terms of the accommodation, service and value for money.  The hotel is beautiful and the facilities are fantastic.  Great service on check in, at the bar, restaurant and the concierge.  Staff couldn‚Äôt do enough for us and truly went that extra mile to ensure my friends and I had a great weekend.  It‚Äôs centrally locates and within walking distance of the shops, bars and restaurants so we didn‚Äôt have far to travel to hit the town.  I‚Äôd highly recommend it! ",5,2017,11,12
226,Excellent ,"Visited here for a night at the start of November, the staff were friendly and efficient, bed was turned for the night which is always nice, never booked breakfast as we had to be out sharp, would recommend and will revisit when in Belfast ",5,2017,11,12
226,First class experience,"Hotel is perfect location to explore the city.  All staff extremely friendly and helpful.  First class experience and would recommend it.  Will definitely be back. The only down side was we booked the set menu as part of a deal, could have a been a better selection.  But service was excellent.",5,2017,11,12
226,High standard hotel centrally located,"Centrally located hotel in Belfast, the service was excellent and we could not have asked more from the staff in the hotel.

The rooms were well appointed with the beds turned down in the evening and things refreshed as you would expect

Breakfast was to a high standard with a wide variety of food available",5,2017,11,12
226,"Excellent hotel; great location, brilliant team.","We‚Äôve had a brilliant time in Belfast and some of that is down to the team at the Fitzwilliam. 

I booked direct through the hotel and upgraded my initial room selection via email. Subsequent emails thereafter were always dealt in a timely and professional fashion. 
My upgrade was a suite on the 8th floor with awesome views of the city and the hills of Belfast....a real good mixture of modern and old. 

The suite itself was fab - walk in rainfall showers for two; a separate bath big enough for two; and a huge bed. There‚Äôs a stocked mini bar and water is replaced in the FOC.
Breakfast wasn‚Äôt included in the room and although at first I was disappointed, this did give us the freedom to go elsewhere for breakfast if wanted. 

We did have breakfast on the first morning. I opted for vegetarian breakfast with bacon as an add on. For cold / continental breakfast there is a good selection food - cereals, meat, cheese, salmon etc. 

The hotel is central to most things, I think. The opera house is next door, st George‚Äôs market is 15 mins walk away, you‚Äôve some nice restaurants on your doorstep and approx 20 min walk to cathedral quarter for more bars and restaurants. And if you don‚Äôt want to walk that far, Brennan‚Äôs across the road is fine for a cold pint or four. ",5,2017,11,12
226,GREAT HOTEL,"This was the first time we had stayed at this hotel, and we wasn't disappointed. Such a warm and welcoming atmosphere the staff are so friendly and helpful it was such a joy to stay here wish we could of stayed longer. It's right in the heart of the city so most places are in walking distance, and there is a lot of great places to visit. Titanic Museum, Belfast  Zoo, Crumlin  jail tour and the best of all is the Game of Thrones Tour for 9hrs but it was worth it. There is so much more to do if you have more time would definitely stay here again. ",5,2017,11,10
226,Extra mile,"Very impressed at the fitzwilliam chef and bar staff for providing an excellent meal for a couple of last minute diners at the bar. Never let anyone say the bar menu isn't as good! Top quality, tasty and great service! ",4,2017,11,09
226,Good business hotel,"My first stay in Belfast and an enjoyable one. My bedroom in the hotel was very comfortable, especially the bed. The shower was also very good. Generally the hotel is in good condition. The food was good: excellent scallops and beef for dinner, albeit I thought the portion of beef was a little small. Breakfast was also freshly cooked and good. I was surprised that the bar could not do a spicy tomato juice before dinner, and with the very limited range of wines by the glass; the glass I had was only OK. ",4,2017,11,09
226,Classy Hotel in Perfect Location,"Perfect location, excellent service, wonderful rooms, spacious bathrooms, comfortable bed, turn down service. Look no further, when in Belfast this is the place to stay. Check rates often as they change, hopefully you get as fortunate as we did! 5 Star experience.",5,2017,11,09
226,business trip,Excellent hotel.  The location was really good.  I had one of the quieter rooms but one of my colleagues had a room that overlooked the road which I think was a bit noisier.  The staff were really helpful.  Breakfast was really good with plenty of choice.  The rooms were very comfortable and the bathroom was huge.  I would stay here again,4,2017,11,09
226,SUPER EFFICIENT HOTEL STAFF,"Had a one night stay on a recent visit to Belfast to see a show.  The staff were super efficient from check-in to the restaurant and bar.  We were greeted upon arrival, in the dining room and in the bar by friendly, welcoming staff who went out of their way to make us feel special. Excellent service all round.",5,2017,11,08
226,Excellent stay,First visit to the Fitzwilliam but certainly won't be our last great three night stay fantastic location super service and the rooms super comfortable we normally wouldn't spend so muchon a hotel but the extra was well worth it.,5,2017,11,07
226,"Convenient Location, Terrible Service","The check-in staff wwas unhepful. Additionally, no one offered to help with bags.  We ate dinner there the first night, which was a huge mistake. The service was terrible, the food was even worse and a service door kept banging so loud I had to cover my ears.  The beds are firm, but ok.  The pillows are too firm.  The room was clean though and the bathroom clean, but the design of it left you no where to put cosmetics or other necessary things. The shower is dangerously slippery.",3,2017,11,07
226,Food,I really enjoyed our stay. The only down side was the buffet in the evening had no vegetarian option. When I asked the waiter what the vegetarian option was he said ‚Äúsalmon‚Äù. I had to explain that was fish and therefore not something a vegetarian would eat. I had a plate of mashed potato for my meal. Also at breakfast both mornings we had to ask for the toast twice as the waitress forgot about it.  ,4,2017,11,06
226,Live this hotel!!,We love this hotel and don't look at any other when planning a night away in Belfast. I have no complaints at all during our stay. The staff is very friendly and very helpful with any queries we had. We will definitely stay her on our next trip to Belfast. ,5,2017,11,05
226,Comments,"The hotel is in a very good position.The check in staff are excellent.The restaurant service is very slow,the food good.The corridors to bedroom very dark and our bedroom windows cannot be opened.The consiege did not even have a map of Belfast.The next day we moved to the Europa Hotel 100 yards away much better value with more atmosphere and a very good  consiege who could not be more helpful.",3,2017,11,05
226,SHORT STAY IN THE FITZWILLIAM,"Being allocated a room towards the front of the hotel (705) there was a lot of traffic noise during the night which made it difficult for a good night's sleep but being located in the city centre I suppose this is unavoidable.  The staff in the Fitzwilliam are excellent and went out of their way to be welcoming, friendly and helpful.  One small point - the bar was unable to serve draught beer during the evening as the gas supply was not available although the barman did explain and was apologetic.  Overall our experience was really good, this hotel has set just the right tone without being over the top.",5,2017,11,04
226,Stylish design and spacious room,"The location is great, where you can find nice restaurants nearby. The property is new and stylish. We booked Deluxe Double Room, which is spacious and well quipped. There's also candle and the view facing the church is great! Staff is friendly. We also enjoy a nice breakfast to kickstart the day in Belfast! ",5,2017,11,04
226,Average,"Stay here quite a lot and returned again for an an overnight stay looking forward to see the treats of what now is supposed to be a five star hotel, the lobby looks fantastic and that's where it finishes, I am by no means complaining as I enjoyed my stay but definitely not a five star hotel, there was no difference in any way in fact the housekeeper knocked on the door at 6.45 asking if we wanted a turndown service, on return from our evening out this service was not done, towels was not replaced which is standard in a five star hotel, breakfast was ok again nothing outstanding, all in all we had a pleasant stay paid five star price but just felt like a very average four star.",3,2017,11,04
226,Fitzwilliam Hotel 5 Stars,"I have stayed here twice this year now and wouldn't stay anywhere else. Beds are so comfortable, great location.....5 mins from everything, staff so welcoming and helpful and lastly just gorgeous. I cannot recommend this hotel enough. ",5,2017,11,04
226,Business - Relaxation,"From the moment you enter the hotel the atmosphere is calm and relaxing with professional, friendly staff there to greet you. Everything detail is considered in the bedroom that makes it very relaxing and comfortable. The location is excellent for business and pleasure (shopping, restaurants, etc). I highly recommend a stay in this hotel when in Belfast.",5,2017,11,03
226,Out of this world,To arriving at the hotel until leaving this hotel was out of this world. The room was spotless and spacious with a big bathroom with a lovely bath and shower. Breakfast was fab and so was room sevice. Dinner in the restaurant was the nicest food I ever tasted. I really enjoyed the cocktails in the bar and the chocolates they leave on your pillows in the evenings. Overall I didnt want to leave and I would highly recommend this hotel.,5,2017,11,03
226,1st Wedding Anniversary,"Our stay was just prefect, lovely, friendly and clean hotel. We would definitely stay again, we stayed for our wedding anniversary and the girl at the front desk knew this and upgraded our room we were so please the room was amazing",5,2017,11,03
226,Hairspray and hotel Stay,"My husband and I stayed at the Fitzwilliam for one night with our 8 year old daughter and were very impressed by everything about the hotel.  From a smooth, friendly checkin until our departure we were treated extremely well and the room was incredible.  Great choice for breakfast and the food was lovely as were the pre-show cocktails that we had before dinner.",5,2017,11,02
226,Sunday evening stay,"Always wanted to stay here but wasn't prepared to pay weekend rates so got a Sunday evening  for around ¬£100 room only. We enjoyed our stay, room was nice and bed was comfy. Good location. Drinks in hotel  bar too pricey when you can go round the corner and get 2 for the same price.",4,2017,11,01
226,Good hotel,My husband and I stayed here for one night. We travelled from Dublin it is so easy to get to driving off the M1 and even easier leaving. It's ideal. The hotel itself is very nice the staff are very helpful especially Liam the concierge.  The rooms are comfortable and the breakfast was good. We will definitely be going back to this hotel.,5,2017,11,01
226,Amazing isnt the word!!,Stayed here last weekend in september for my friends hen party and we had a ball. The staff are so friendly and make you feel at home. We did the cocktail making class and would highly recommend it. We also had dinner and breakfast and the food was out of this world. Hotel is gorgeous and located well to city centre....this was my second time staying here and il be back again soon.,5,2017,11,01
226,excellent,It was our anniversary the hotel went above and beyond. Very happy with the room and staff were all fabulous. Excellent sleep and breakfast. No noise from other rooms to worry about which is an issue with other hotels.,5,2017,10,31
226,Great stay,"Thoroughly enjoyed our wedding anniversary with all the staff. Special thanks to Pearse from the Bar and new member of the Hotel receptionist(trainee) sorry I forgot your name my friend =)

We will be back on 26th of December for more of Fitzwilliam experience! 

Thank you for everything!!!",5,2017,10,31
226,One of the best hotels in Belfast,"This is by far one of the best hotels in Belfast. The service & standard is far superior to even similar priced hotels like Malmaison. For a 5 star hotel their prices are reasonable but the service speaks for itself. I booked 4 rooms for a family celebration & everyone was impressed with the rooms, the food, the service. Going back in a couple of weeks and very much looking forward to it. ",5,2017,10,31
226,A very comfortable stay,"An excellent stay with a beautiful comfortable room. Great location for city center break. Shops, bar and restaurant within 5 minute walk. Excellent food. Generally friendly helpful staff.
Comfortable reception area/Lobby with comfortable seating.
",5,2017,10,31
226,Wedding Anniversary,"My wife and I stayed in this hotel to celebrate our wedding anniversary in October. From the minute we entered the hotel until we checked out the next day we received the very best of attention from Reception, Bar staff, Restaurant staff and housekeeping.
Brian was particularly welcoming at the bar as was Pearce. The dinner was delicious in the restaurant and the service was attentive without being intrusive. The room was perfect and we will certainly visit and stay again. I will not name other fine hotels we have stayed in in Belfast but this was certainly the best of the best.",5,2017,10,30
226,review,"Very good hotel in excellent location and very helpful staff. Dinner was bland, due to being overcooked. Shower cubicle needs looked at as it was impossible to have a shower without the water spilling onto the floor",4,2017,10,30
226,Excellent hotel,"We stayed in the hotel for two nights to celebrate my husband's 50th birthday and I wish we could have stayed longer.  The rooms were very well furnished, modern, very clean and the service was excellent.  The breakfast was also excellent and there was plenty to choose from.  All of the staff were very friendly and polite.  We sat in the lounge area a couple of times to have a drink and it was very comfortable and the fire was lovely.  Would thoroughly recommend staying at this hotel.  We are hoping to return again soon.",5,2017,10,30
226,Excellent h√¥tel to visit Belfast,"Comfortable, well located efficient and friendly staff, good breakfast. This h√¥tel is very convenient to go to all the places worth visiting in the city and also near buses and railway station. The buffet breakfast is great ",5,2017,10,30
226,Best in Ireland!,Fine service and beautiful rooms. Decadent bar. Easy access to all in Belfast. Easy check-in and out. The concierge was very helpful with absolutely everything from check-in to sightseeing to umbrellas and directions. Across the street from Robinson's Bar and the Crown Bar. Easy access to buses and taxis. Easily the best hotel we stayed in all of Ireland over a two week vacation.,5,2017,10,29
226,Classy,"We were in the city for a concert and decided to treat ourselves to a bit of luxury. 
The hotel was way beyond our expectations,  excellent food , attentive staff, lovely room.
An overall brilliant experience. 
",5,2017,10,29
226,Manners cost nothing! ,"After visiting another hotel in the town, where the service was extremely poor, we arrived at the fitzwilliam to a very warm welcome. The staff were attentive when we walked through the door. Brian crozier was fantastic and very friendly.. an asset to your establishment. Bar staff dark haired girl also brilliant.. excellent hotel!",5,2017,10,28
226,Cream of the concierges,"A lovely two nights here during a mini trip to Belfast. Rooms were sumptuous, as was front of house. Liam, the concierge, went above and beyond to help us, especially when our tour taxi didn't show. The cooked breakfast choice was quite limited or I would have given 5 stars. ",4,2017,10,27
226,Probably one of the best in Belfast,"We have stayed in a corner room. The room had very nice furnitures, big in size, comfortable bed. The only problem with the room was, the windows were not sound proof, therefore all the traffic noise was coming to the room although we were on 7th floor. Second negative point about the hotel is the choices in the buffet, very poor given the standart of this hotel. No salads, tomatoes, or cream cheese etc. Other than this, extremely helpful staff at reception, concierge and at housekeeping.",4,2017,10,27
226,An excellent stay at the Fitzwilliam Hotel Belfast,We had a very comfortable stay at this luxurious hotel and can't wait to stay again. The staff were very friendly and helpful and the location was ideal for seeing everything we wanted to see. The rooms were very comfortable and included everything we could possibly require.,5,2017,10,27
226,Another superb stay at the Fitz!,"Booked a DBB deal early Oct & enjoyed our stay immensely!  Room not ready upon arrival around 430pm so were given complimentary drinks in the foyer. Very nice! Signature corner room with lovely bathroom incl shower & bath.  Room a good size with full length mirror.  Dinner was really lovely as was breakfast!  Service a little slow at times & parking is extra, these were my only gripes.",5,2017,10,26
226,Excellent Hotel - will definitely return.,"I recently stayed at The Fitzwilliam, Belfast, for 2 nights in a Junior Suite.

The room was lovely: very large, excellent views, comfortable bed, and lots of nice extras such as the turn-down service with chocolates.

Each member of staff I spoke with was polite and attentive. My only slight critique is that I was asked when checking in if I would like a newspaper each morning. Despite giving my choice, this was never received.

I liked having the option to go for Breakfast despite not pre-paying, and did take up this choice on my final morning. The breakfast both continental and cooked was very tasty and the service was exceptional.

226,Amazing times!,"Very nice hotel, excellent service, perfect location!! We even got to see a few celebrities staying here from GoT, recomended 100%! One thing though use the rubber mat they give you for the shower it gets very Slippery ",5,2017,10,26
226,A little disappointed,"A very centrally located Hotel handy to shopping, convenience stores pubs and restaurants.

Room we had was very warm (27c) on dial at times and seemed uncontrollable. Had to get it looked at and it reduced to (23c). Uncomfortable. Room was clean and in good condition.

Staff and service very good with a friendly welcome.

Dined restaurant one night in the Restaurant and in the bar the next. 

I don't know how this works as presumably there is one kitchen but the bar menu is better than the restaurant. 

The food served in the bar was hot and large portions. 

The food served in the restaurant was served lukewarm and the servings minuscule. 

Got us puzzled.",3,2017,10,25
226,The Fitzwilliam provided a more personal level of service than we believe possible at the larger hotel nearby.,"Before and during our stay we received excellent service from The Fitzwilliam. For example, my wife had chosen to have her 70th birthday celebration in Belfast, and some friends wanted to be there to help her celebrate. Naturally, we wanted to plan some activities they would enjoy. Despite having been in Belfast several years earlier, we needed current information to plan. So, I relied on Philip, a concierge at The Fitzwilliam. He provided excellent advice on tours, drivers, pricing and the best restaurants in Belfast. I never would have been able to show our guests such a good time without his services. Other people at The Fitzwilliam also stepped up to serve our guests. And I do not believe the larger hotel nearby that caters to events and concerences would have given us such effective and caring personal serv8ce. We were exteremly happy with our stay at The Fitzwilliam and would enthuriastically recommend it to others.",5,2017,10,24
226,Fabulous hotel in a great city.,"We had a great stay at the Fitzwilliam Hotel. The hotel is luxurious and the food and drink is delicious.

On arrival as requested - had prosecco on ice, chocolates and rose petals on the bed! We like this hotel as it has 5 star quality but with little fuss. Easy check in / check out service with friendly staff and a beautiful breakfast to set you on your way in the morning. Excellent location within the city with easy secure parking. Highly recommended.

226,Amazing stay from start to end. ,"Stayed here for the first time last weekend and it will not be my last. From the second of walking through the doors I was stunned by the amazing decor of the lobby and greeted by the friendly staff. Check in was fast altho our room wasnt quite ready  so we headed to the bar for a drink while we waited. The concierge Declan offered to mind our bags until our room was ready. When we got up to our AMAZING room (corner view, get it if your staying here you wont regret the extra cost) it was breath taking with the views and all the decor. The only down part to staying here is that one night is just not enough. Thank you to all your staff especially concierges Liam & Declan who went the extra mile for us with out even asking. Will be staying here again hopefully near future. ",5,2017,10,21
226,Really nice hotel with really nice staff,"Stayed here for one night this week with colleagues. Very nice place well located for city centre. Staff at check in were friendly, welcoming and efficient. Room was very well appointed. Really comfortable bed. Bath and separate shower. Shower was excellent.

226,Midweek stay,enjoyed a business visit to Belfast at The Fitzwilliam - helpful staff throughout the hotel and a great breakfast. hotel is in the centre of town and within easy reach of many attractions and business offices.,5,2017,10,19
226,Cannot be faulted! ,"Professional and friendly staff from the second you arrive until you leave. We ordered valley parking when we booked. When we arrived we were welcomed straight away and out bags collected from the car. When checking in we felt there was nothing more they could do for us. The room was absolutely spotless, spacious and very modern. We came back to the hotel after a night out and ordered room service. Usually at that time of night when you order a pizza in a hotel it's a frozen one thrown in the oven. This wasn't the case! Even at that time of night it was an authentic Italian style pizza and couldn't be faulted. Checkout was hassle free. I really can't fault the hotel or the staff in any way. I will definitely be back!   ",5,2017,10,18
226,Good well appointed hotel,Very nice modern contemporary hotel with good rooms and excellent service throughout right in the heart of Belfast.

226,"Beautiful Hotel with a wonderful ambiance, great lobby sitting area and a fireplace.","The Fitzwilliam Hotel Belfast is very retro and beautiful.  Our stay there was pleasant and warm and the rooms are decorated with charm and warmth.  The dining area is also rich in color and atmosphere like the rest of the hotel.

226,Beautiful,Hotel is beautiful staff are very helpful. Only down fall there was no bar tender at the bar when we went in and another member of staff had to serve who was very nervous but very friendly. Would really recommend it. ,4,2017,10,17
226,Excellent hotel in Belfast,"We had booked a 3 night stay, which ended up a 4 night stay due to storm Ophelia, the hotel is in a great location for visiting the city and all the amenities are first class. The staff in are all friendly and helpful and the rooms spacious and well equipped. Its a must for a comfortable stay.",5,2017,10,17
226,Nice place if a bit formal!,"Hotel was very nice but a little too formal. The location is gratin heart of the city, The Staff great if not a bit formal probably management style and protocols. Room was on street corner as was noisy from traffic.",4,2017,10,17

226,"Perfect Hotel, perfect Staff!",We are afterwards to Liverpool to the DoubleTree by Hilton Hotel & Spa. This hotel and especially the staff could still learn a lot from Fitzwilliam Belfast. Compliment to the Fitzwilliam Hotel Belfast !!,5,2017,10,16
226,Beautiful hotel,"We booked this hotel for one  night on our self-drive tour on our way back to Dublin. It felt great to be in a luxury hotel after enduring one night in Derry in a one-star hotel, in our opinion, that had been booked by our tour company. Wonderful accommodations with great bathroom and breakfast.",5,2017,10,16
226,Fantastic hotel,I stayed for 4 nights while on a business trip and I could not recommend this hotel enough. Every aspect of service was excellent. The staff are excellent in terms of customer service. They are always smiling and are very accommodating. I had breakfast every morning and the staff in the restaurant are very well trained. They provide a very prompt service. They fully understand that breakfast needs to be fast as people have work to get to. And they do their best to make sure that there are no delays. The rooms are very comfortable. ,5,2017,10,16
226,Best Hotel on the Tour,"This was a lovely, well appointed hotel with mostly excellent staff. (0NE waiter seemed to avoid serving a gay member of our party, leaving him without food for a significant time. I addressed this with another waiter, but the problem continued. Not acceptable!) However, the front desk staff and others were extremely helpful telling us how to get to Tesco's Express and recommending a couple of restaurants nearby. One of them, India Gate, had the best curry I've ever had. 

The room was air-conditioned and had a small refrigerator.  This was wonderful! The beds were comfortable and the shower was heaven. 

This is what I expect when a hotel says it is four star.  Well done!",5,2017,10,15
226,Amazing stay,Excellent from the moment we arrived.gorgeous rooms and amazing staff.brilliant location close to all the good bars and restaurants-we ate in flame which was excellent.loved our stay can't wait to book again,5,2017,10,15
226,The lap of luxury!,Fantastic hotel with 5 star service all the way.  This was our second visit and was just as impressive as the first. Booked dinner in the restaurant this time and was not disappointed - clean plates all the way!  Great location and food in the heart of Belfast. Thoroughly recommend!,5,2017,10,15
226,The Fitzwilliam fits but doesn't awe.,"My husband and I stayed in The Fitzwilliam in Belfast for three nights.  The room was certainly adequate, but we were initially placed in a room designed for someone in  a wheelchair, which did not have a bathroom tub. 
We were moved to a more comfortable setting for our 2nd and 3rd nights.  
My husband wanted to run at the hotel, but the fitness room only had one treadmill, which was broken.  The entire fitness center was very limited in resources, period.
 The bar has food for dinner, which we enjoyed after drinks there one evening.  I was the final person for breakfast at The Restaurant on our last morning, and enjoyed the pastries and fresh fruit.  
We found the concierge service to be fairly useless.  While the gentlemen were friendly, the dinner recommendation for us was  to go down the street where we would find several restaurants in the next block.  We did not use the concierge service again.
The location is central to much of the city and we were able to walk to the Bus/train station only a block away to get our bus directly to the airport upon our departure.  A short walk took us to the City Hop On-Hop Off bus, which we use in new places to get a sense of neighborhoods, sites to revisit, and places we might want to see that were not noted in travel information services.  We were not directed there by the hotel but we also did not ask about sight-seeing services.

226,Stay Here,One of the best hotels I have ever stayed in. Staff was incredible. Anything I needed was taken care of. The towels were some of the softest I've ever used and the heated towel rack was the perfect extra touch. The mirror also had a heated spot so it never completely fogged over. Turn down service left wonderful chocolate pieces in a box on the pillows. Overall the Fitzwilliam Hotel was an amazing experience and I was very sad to leavr.,5,2017,10,14
226,Great visit to the Fitzwilliam,"Excellent service, beautiful room and great location. Highly recommended!!!
Staff at hotel are so pleasant and go above and beyond to make your stay comfortable and ensure you have all that you need during your stay.",5,2017,10,14
226,Quiet Luxurious Oasis,"We stayed at the Fitzwilliam for just 1 night, but wished we would have booked longer. Upon  arriving, we were greeted by friendly and helpful staff who safely stored our luggage and upgraded our room. Our room was was so calm and peaceful, with classical music playing. The bathroom and bed were large and just so comfortable! The turn down service was a bonus! I highly recommend this quiet oasis in the bustling city of Belfast.",5,2017,10,14
226,simply the best hotel,I have ever been to anywhere in the world- and what makes it so good is the staff- all of them - it is a lovely place to stay beautifully appointed and excellent breakfast- BUT there are lots of places like that- it is the sheer friendliness and patience iof the staff that marks this place out as THE BEST,5,2017,10,12

226,Excellent Hotel,"Our 2 nights stay was excellent in every category. The rooms were wonderfully appointed, comfortable and extremely clean- we especially enjoyed the in-room tea items and evening turn-down service with chocolate! Breakfast was cooked to order and delicious as was our afternoon tea service which we decided to have in the lobby and was happily accommodated. Valet/concierge service was attentive and helpful as well. You truly can't go wrong with this centrally located hotel- it was our favorite during our 10 day stay around Ireland!",5,2017,10,10
226,"Lovely though, service was lacking!","My husband and I have stayed here a few times as we tend to visit Grand opera house frequently throughout the year depending on shows. 
We sometimes use restaurant for a meal beforehand with a pre theatre menu. We were here last week (early October) and the restaurant was quiet enough, which we like. Our server was quite tired looking and seemed a little unenthusiastic. (slick hair guy very uncouth) apart from this we had a lovely meal and recommend the beef, absolutely delightful. 
We are visiting again in early November hopefully with a happier experience.

226,Beautiful Hotel in the Heart of Belfast,I'm so glad we decided to stay at The FitzWilliam Hotel. The property is in a great location and very tastefully appointed.  Our room was very comfortable and even had plenty of closet space.  I loved the modern decor of the room and the classic look of the lobby. It's a real gem and very affordable for a hotel of this quality. We highly recommend it. ,5,2017,10,08
226,Wedding preparations,Stayed at Fitzwilliam to prepare for my wedding on Friday 6th October and the room was comfortable and relaxing. Hairstylist and makeup artist were also impressed   Had a lovely snack in the bar the evening before and even the background music was just right!,5,2017,10,08
226,This hotel never fails - Super location. Great staff. ,"I am a regular visitor to this hotel for business. It never fails on service...Excellent staff on reception and in the bar and restaurant. 
Great breakfast.
Rooms are fabulous and have been recently decorated.
In a superb location.",5,2017,10,06
226,Quality,"Lovely hotel in town centre. 

Rooms are excellent. Very nicely done out with smart touches like a pack of cards. 

Super breakfast menu. Best kippers I've had in ages. 

Two small gripes: doorman watched me, in the rain, grappling with my 3 bags from the taxi. No help offered.  

Secondly, they charge a ridiculous ¬£5 'tray fee' as a room service supplement. Desperate Ryanair behaviour. ",4,2017,10,05
226,Great spot,"The food at the fitzwilliam is to die for,slap bang in the centre of belfast close to everything ...shops,transport ,pubs ...a little pricey but luxurious and top end ,well worth a few extra pounds.try it.",5,2017,10,04
226,Beautiful,"For a Sunday night away, my husband and I stayed in the Fitzwilliam Hotel. I was looking forward to this as I'd read great reviews beforehand. I wasn't disappointed.
Check-in was extremely quick. We arrived 2 hours before check-in understanding that they had a left luggage facility. Fortunately our room was ready. The receptionist was very friendly, giving us lots of advice on evening meal options. 
Our room was on the 6th floor, an executive suite. The decor is gorgeous and sumptuous. Grey and mint green furnishings.  The bathroom was dark and sensual with black tiling and chrome accessories. I loved it. The toiletries were high end and of good amount. If there had been anything I'd forgotten to pack, I'm sure the hotel had thought of it. Also a nice touch was the local magazines, some for the ladies to browse and some of local interest. 
We had dinner at the pre-theatre sitting. 5-6.30pm. Food was very nice, I had a slight issue with my main which was very quickly resolved. Staff are extremely attentive but not intrusive.
Afterwards we had a few drinks in the bar. Lovely table service with great waiters. Reasonably priced.
On return to our room, chocolates had been left, extra towels and bottled water. Lovely touches. 
If I hadn't of know better, I would have thought we were the only residents. It was so quiet. No noise from elevators, people returning to rooms or maids. So peaceful. Bed was lovely and comfortable. Slept well. 
Check out very quick and receptionist polite. Door men waiting to help you to your car if you had used the valet option. 
The Fitzwilliam Hotel has a very central city location with sightseeing and shopping all very close by within walking distance. 
Would I stay here again? Absolutely.",5,2017,10,02
226,Belfast getaway ,"We stayed in the Fitzwilliam for two nights over a weekend at the end of September.We booked a superior twin, as there was no king size available due to the fact we booked the day before arrival. During checkin the receptionist thoughtfully asked if we wanted the beds pushed together. This was a nice touch as other hotels had not bothered to ask if we wanted this. I loved the room and the decor. I found the bed comfy and the room wasn't too warm as I find in a lot of hotels. If it did get slightly too hot, turning of the air con for a short period of time certainly helped. I found the staff to be very helpful and pleasant.  
The only negative thing was the the food we had in the bar the afternoon we arrived. For a 5* establishment I found the panini really lacking. Our booking did not include breakfast and we decided not to have breakfast after trying the bar food. Maybe the Fitz could have redeemed itself if we had taken the chance. Overall I'd definitely like to stay here again and I believe the location is brilliant. ",5,2017,10,02
226,Wonderful and Convenient!,My wife and I thoroughly enjoyed our stay at the Fitzwilliam. All of the staff were especially friendly and helpful. The breakfast selections were more than expected and we especially liked that we could order dishes from a menu. We would definitely stay there again next time we're in Belfast.,5,2017,10,02
226,Hen weekend,"I booked this deal with The Fitzwilliam hotel for my hen weekend, it was amazing from start to finish!  The staff were so friendly, the rooms were fabulous, the location was perfect & the food was delicious!  Well done guys!",5,2017,10,02
226,The Fantastic Fitzwilliam,"I stayed at the Fitzwilliam with friends as part of my birthday celebrations in Belfast and I wasn't disappointed. The hotel is beautiful, the staff are very friendly and attentive and the cocktails are amazing!

We booked directly which was a very easy process and included breakfast which is delicious and worth doing.

Staff were also very helpful with getting around the city and the concierge organised a black cab tour for us on the Sunday, which was great.

I would definitely recommend this hotel and will stay here again if/when I come back to Belfast.",5,2017,10,02
226,"Well appointed, good value","Central location and good value for money, hotel delivered what it promised. Efficient staff, not overly friendly, but professional. Easy walking distance to Titanic, restaurants & bars. Spacious & well appointed room.",4,2017,10,01
226,Chic and boutique,"We stayed for a Sunday night and had a wonderful stay. The hotel is really chic and low-key. It may have lots of rooms but it didn't feel like a huge hotel, it had the feel of a small, intimate, boutique hotel. It had a vintage feel, deco-ish mixed with 60s Vegas glamour, but not in a tacky way, just cool and stylish. 

All of the staff were friendly and efficient but had a relaxed vibe which made us feel completely at home and comfortable.

The room was beautiful! We were on the 7th floor and luckily this allowed us a view of the mountains in the distance. The room and the view continued the Vegas feel, but without the jetlag!

The downstairs bar was really well appointed; lots of cocktails on offer. Booth and table seating in a low-lit setting kept the intimate feel. The lobby lounge was light and airy, perfect spot for a night cap or an afternoon cocktail.

The restaurant was equally as intimate, although our booth was a little dark (top tip- create a makeshift lamp with a jug of water with a phone torch underneath!) it felt cozy. The food was fantastic! Possibly the best ribeye steak I've eaten. Breakfast in the restaurant was also excellent, we had the full fry.

The location is perfect for exploring the city, just round the corner from some great bars and a short walk from the city centre. Public transport seems really easy if you don't want to walk or if you need to go further afield, and the desk was more than happy to arrange taxis for us. 

In all the stay was brilliant, we can't wait to make our way back over soon to maybe stay a bit longer.",5,2017,09,30
226,5 star experience,"Just a short stay for a conference but the hotel was welcoming and the staff very friendly . They were very happy to suggest places of interest and where to find the best Guinness in town. Even the maintenance staff were greeting you with a chat 

",5,2017,09,30
226,Best in town,"Thoroughly enjoyed our stay.. Lovely clean room with a huge bed that was very comfortable and the bedding was high quality and was made up beautifully. The staff in the Fitzwilliam are all clearly very well trained. Customer service was excellent from the reception, concierge to the wonderful cocktail makers in the bar and the chambermaids. For us being made to feel welcome and valued is the most important aspect of a hotel stay, Thats why I doubt we will ever stay anywhere else again when we come to Belfast...The Fitzwilliam does it best ! ",5,2017,09,30
226,*****,"Fabulous hotel. Fantastic rooms, service and food. Cannot fault a single thing and would highly recommend. The rooms are decorated to an extremely high standard and extremely comfy, spotless and very quiet given the location. The extras in the room such as candle and matches in bath and coffee machine and pods to mention 2really make the hotel stay out. The food is amazing and staff friendly. One of the nicest hotels I ve stayed in",5,2017,09,29
226,Special Holiday Break Spoiled,"We had booked Merchant Hotel for special short holiday break however on short notice we had to change dates, Merchant no vacancies so we booked Fitzwilliam. Booking stated wheelchair accessible room NOT wheelchair modified room so i didn't expect any real problems.
However bathroom was modified - washbasin mounted extremely low on wall & as I have arthritis in my back I was unable to use it. Couldn't shave as i use a blade razor, Open shower which sprayed water across floor, no shelf to leave toiletries on & no bath. Complained to Reception who pointed out that we had booked thru 3rd party however they would advise Duty Mgr. That was at Check In 3pm latter did not ring us till 8.30pm - hotel fully booked so nothing he could do.
Bedroom very warm & AC noisy so we left window open while we went out to dinner but hotel closed it while we were out so very warm room & little sleep. Overall a bad experience, 

",2,2017,09,29
226,Afternoon tea ,"Had the extreme pleasure of Afternoon tea here last week.
It was a special celebration with my wife and sons.
We arrived and were shown to a reserved area in front of the fire.
Our waiter David was amazing.
Really looked after us and our picky taste buds.
I don't do fish.... So no Salmon please.. üòÇ
We all really enjoyed ourselves..
Would recommend this as a gift for friends or family.

226,Wine Tasting,"Had a wine tasting event in this hotel which was phenomenal, great experience. Stayed there for a night and it was superb, the service extremely polite and you have all the facilities in the rooms. The bar was excellent just behind the reception desk. The prices are high but definitely worth it.",5,2017,09,28
226,Belfast,Very good and ideally located. Room was very good with a lot of space. Service on the whole friendly and able to assist in places to go/providers to use for certain trips etc. Suited our needs perfectly.,5,2017,09,28
226,"Good location, a little noisy at the front of the hotel ","Central location for bars and restaurants. Rooms are very comfortable, nice touches with the bath robes, slippers and bed turn down. Comfy bed however the traffic noise at the front of the hotel can be annoying. 

I will return to the Fitz on my next trip to Belfast.

226,Mum and daughter bonding time,Loved our 2 day stay in your beautiful hotel. Every member of staff was fantastic and very helpful and pleasant..Rooms beautiful and very clean. Food amazing and very good value. My mum and myself enjoyed the pre theatre menu and very good value for money. Our whole stay was relaxing which was good as my mum has limited mobility and nothing was any trouble for the lovely staff. Will recommend to everyone and will definately be back. Well worth the 5 stars your beautiful hotel has,5,2017,09,26
226,Short break,Lovely hotel with every convenience available. Staff were helpful and friendly. Room was well fitted out and everything about the stay was good. Food in the restaurant was top class. Would gladly stay again next time I'm in Belfast ,5,2017,09,26
226,Server at dinner had no soul,Paid nearly ¬£100 for dinner and got no thank you. Looked my wife up and down when she asked for a glass of wine. Few stains on the seat in our room and a few of the fixtures were falling down. Wouldn't say the place is 5 star. ¬£17 for breakfast was pretty steep.,3,2017,09,26
226,Helen Knox,"A wonderful experience; staff were professional and very helpful. Location of hotel is excellent. 
The room was comfortable and the bed was a pleasure to sleep in. Lighting in the corridor was too low and failed to giver the 'atmosphere' that was probably intended. Linens were luxurious and towels were generous and luxurious.",5,2017,09,24
226,"Lovely, but not quite 5 stars for me...","Beautiful hotel with lovely decor and stylish rooms. Food in the bar was very tasty and drinks were great, had a very enjoyable evening in the bar drinking cocktails and having dinner. Most staff were very pleasant and chatty apart from what appeared to be the bar manager, very abrupt and didn't get a good vibe from him at all, not a very polite or welcoming man. Had a lovely stay and great nights sleep, for a Saturday night the room was very quiet and the bed was really spacious and comfy. To me, however, 5 stars is about attention to detail... not to be picky but one of the light fittings was hanging off in our room, there was a stain on the chair, the playing cards and other things were missing from their box and a couple of small tiles were missing in the shower. Breakfast was wildly overpriced for what was on offer... ¬£17 each for a cooked breakfast and ¬£13 for continental is a bit steep for breakfast consisting of the same types of foods that can be eaten anywhere in Belfast at a reasonable price.",4,2017,09,24
226,Afternoon tea,"My daughter and I had a wonderful experience yesterday having afternoon tea! Our food was amazing with our personal requests being accommodated with no fuss, great chef! Best afternoon tea we have had in Belfast. Great staff especially Anna and Justin, thank you. We loved it!",5,2017,09,24
226,Amazing hotel,"Service, rooms, food, location all brilliant, thank you to all the staff for their warm welcome, they couldn't do enough to help.  Took my husband for his 50th birthday and I couldn't have asked for more ",5,2017,09,23
226,Classy Hotel!,"Beautiful, classy city hotel. Good food, nice bar. Great staff. Only complaint was that they had no steam irons.  If we had been there for wedding or business event and needed to steam out wrinkles from clothing packed in luggage, we would have been very upset. Seems ridiculous that we could find steam irons in the smallest B&B‚Äôs we stayed in, but not at such a luxurious hotel.",5,2017,09,22
226,Excellent experience,"We were very pleased with our experience at the Fitzwilliam and would certainly return. Everyone we were exposed to was friendly, helpful, and professional. The hotel was comfortable and quiet. We had no issues whatsoever. My expectations are always high and they came through beautifully",5,2017,09,19
226,The small things make all the difference...,"Just enjoyed a great weekend in Belfast staying at the Fitzwilliam.  The hotel is as you would expect, well appointed rooms, cosy lobby lounge, bar with extensive drinks menu etc.  The thing that stood out for us was the friendly, helpful team and the small things that made us feel like welcome guests including being greeted by name in the mornings and evenings and having directions programmed into the Sat Nav for the most convenient petrol station so we could fill up our hire car on the way back to the airport.  We had a great time and will definitely stay at the Fitzwilliam again.",5,2017,09,18
226,A luxurious stay,"Great welcome, friendly staff, luxurious rooms and extremely comfortable bed.  Amazing central location, walkable distance of many attractions.  Fantastic place to stay.  An expensive hotel but well worth the money for all the above reasons.  Our stay included breakfast which was good but not quite excellent.",4,2017,09,18
226,September stay,"All good. Room was a bit warm and the air conditioner was quite noisy! Would have helped sleep quality to be able to cool the room a bit! 
The rest of our stay was excellent. Food quality and service was very good. Staff were very friendly and helpful. ",5,2017,09,18
226,"Lovely, Quiet, Convenient","Beautiful room, awesome bathroom. The staff were efficient, and obliging.  The location couldn't have been better.  It is very quiet at night.  Unfortunately, they leave the radio on in the empty rooms, so the first night it woke me.  We told the staff and it didn't happen again.  Our burned out light bulb was changed immediately.  The toiletries smelled like chapstick, but except for those minor quibbles, it was a wonderful stay.",5,2017,09,18
226,Fitzwilliam Hotel Belfast 5* experience,"1st class service and quality!

Check in was slick.  We even had a birthday plate delivered shortly after arrival.  

We had afternoon tea - which was fantastic.  Plate for 2 would have fed 4 - so yeah for a take home box!  

Evening turn down service with chocolates on the pillow.

Bedroom was fantastic - lots of extras.  bathroom was beautiful - huge bath, separate shower and lovely products.  

Would highly recommend.

",5,2017,09,18
226,"Smart, slick, comfortable, friendly and efficient. Best in Belfast?","Very well-positioned, the staff, from reception to Concierge and housekeeping are all very friendly and helpful. (Executive) Rooms are large and wellset up, modern yest luxurious, and super king beds very comfortable with both feather and man-made pillows. Wifi is good. Food is very good in the bar, with a wide range from Thai and Asian to the regulars of steak and pizza. Restaurant food is excellent, though rather a subdued ambience. I always stay here when on business in Belfast.",5,2017,09,18
226,"Great hotel, great location","Stayed here for a week on business. The staff was very helpful, rooms were nice with plenty of space, and food was good. Had fish and chips for lunch the day I arrived, and breakfast a couple of days. All very good. The staff was great at recommending other restaurants and booking reservations.",5,2017,09,17
226,Great city centre hotel,"Great hotel , ideally located in the city centre within walking distance of shops and restaurants. Helpful friendly staff and nice decor. Have  stayed here three times and will return whenever I am back in Belfast  . Highly recommended.",5,2017,09,17
226,Excellent hotel,"Everything about this hotel was excellent from the moment we arrived until we left, the staff were more than helpful, the room was spotlessly clean and the bar was very relaxing to have a drink and unwind after a busy day, would definitely book this hotel next time we are on business in Belfast.",5,2017,09,17
226,On point concierge,"When we registered at the reception desk, no one informed us that the  room they assigned to us had handicapped access; which meant that there was a tiny tiny sink that is about a foot below the average height to accommodate a .wheelchair. Needless to say, bending down to wash my hands etc was a challenge and water splashed everywhere. There was barely room to put my hairbrush so I opened up the ironing board and used it as a counter. Also I had to call for a luggage rack . It was an uncomfortable situation for non handicapped guestS. By the time I realized all this, I was unpacked and it was very late. I complained to the receptionist upon leaving that they should have at least informed me. She claimed that because we reserved through a 3rd party , it was the room that was available. REALLY? 

HOWEVER, the saving grace was Zi, the concierge. He gave us perfect suggestions on tours, pubs and restaurants.  He knew exactly what we wanted. We didn't even bother with checking YELP reviews.. just follow Zi's recommendations and the evening is perfect! I WOULD GIVE HIM 5 stars.",4,2017,09,16
226,If you like efficiency,"If you like efficiency and you need to be in this part of town, this is your place.  The rooms are modern and efficient and the services offered are first rate.  The hotel is located near plenty of attractions as well as restaurants and pubs.",5,2017,09,16
226,Gone downhill- appalling service,"I was not going to write this review but after a week I feel people need to know. 
Stayed here last weekend for my 30th birthday (which the hotel knew about). if you are staying in anything less than a duluxe room I suggest you go elsewere ‚Äì there are better 3* in belfast. The executive rooms are dated and to say the walls were ‚Äúdirty‚Äù would be being kind. Not Fitzwilliam standard. 
The 4 course meal was part of the deal. We were given a pre-theatre menu which is very limited. We did get 2 glasses of drink complimentary 4 my birthday ‚Äì although check the name of the person before you call them mrs. the starter was small and salty. Our mains were on the table of the people beside us for some time before realising their mistake. I did not eat my main course- it was a very limited choice. We were then asked if would like to see dessert menu which you wouldn‚Äôt be asked if on a 4 course dinner deal. The dessert was just ok. We were then handed a ¬£60 bill!! Shocking service
My partner spoke to the man and told him we were on the dinner deal. He said he had given us the wrong menu, proceeded to charge ¬£17 of the ¬£60 for drinks we had whilst telling my partner they are very similar menus which they are not!!
Stayed in many hotels over the years and never once complained however my partner paid a lot to stay here to be given this service. The lady at reception who was lovely asked the man in restaurant what happened who then lied and told her he had not given us the wrong menu after 5 mins previously telling my partner that he had. So that was it for us we asked to see a manager.
She was a nice lady who in all fairness couldn‚Äôt have apologised to us enough. She had spoken to him and he admitted giving us the wrong menu and she explained they are quite different menus and we had not been given the value of what we paid for. She did offer us more food drinks and to clear the money paid for drinks. We had other plans for the evening at this stage and did not want to return to the restaurant. We were not there to get freebies only the service you would expect from a hotel like this. 
At breakfast the next morning she did ask my partner if he had a good evening. breakfast was not good, my partners egg was not cooked and mine just about, we also witnessed another lady send her eggs back for the same reason. we had had enough and could not face complaining again and left shortly after.

The only thing that highlighted how bad this was was the fact I now know my partner was trying to propose and the added stress whole situation had caused him and his need to apologise to me for it being so bad.",2,2017,09,15
226,Beautiful,"I have been fortunate enough to stay at this property for the second time and it is still beautiful, the reception and lobby is stunning and very comfortable, the hotel is in a great central location, Belfast is a compact city so you can walk anywhere from this location. The rooms are very well designed, with extremely comfortable beds and a pillow menu so all tastes are catered for, the bathrooms are big with separate showers, the only issue I have is the lack of shelving/counter space in the massive bathrooms. One thing I was not very happy with, I was travelling with a friend and we were on separate floors 3rd and 6th the hall ways are very very dark!  I would recommend this hotel and it would always be my fist choice in Belfast.",4,2017,09,15
226,Finest hotel in Belfast,it is the hotel in Belfast to stay at and would recommend to all. The food is great and service is always spot on. Tastefully decorated through out and all the rooms are well maintained. A gem in Belfast.,5,2017,09,15
226,Amazing Hotel in the Heart of BELFAST,"Amazing Hotel ‚Äì Awesome Location

Stayed in the hotel for two nights. After having a nightmare-ish stay in Dublin, when we moved to Belfast, Anything better was a welcome break. Fitzwilliam was more than ‚Äúanything better‚Äù and that too at much better price. Felt like back to civilization.

Check in ‚Äì Smooth and before time. We got a corner room with two side views facing the rear of Town hall with decent skyline view.

Room ‚Äì Spacious, comfortable and full of all the creature comforts in line with any 5 star property (when we booked, it was a 4 star & got 5 star accreditation recently, that‚Äôs what we were told). Super spacious bathroom and awesome space to walk /sit around.

Food ‚Äì It was let down. The breakfast was prices ~40 pounds for two with almost nothing for my wife who was on veg-gluton free diet. Didn‚Äôt try much in the hotel.

Check-out ‚Äì Swift and seamless.

Verdict ‚Äì Despite the food, I‚Äôll still rate it a first class experience.",5,2017,09,14
226,Cruise gone bad....an unexpected stay in Belfast!,"While touring an old castle, my traveling friend fell and broke her hip.  Knowing she would need an advocate, I got off the ship with all of our belongings.  The first 2 hotels were awful.  Not only did I find a great hotel, but I found a great staff who were always caring and helping me when needed.  I was there for 8 days.  If I ever return, THIS is the hotel I'd choose.  It is right in the heart of town.  After total hip replacement, my friend got well enough to travel back to the U.S.  Love, love, love this hotel and it's excellent staff!  P.S. The upstairs restaurant is superb...well priced.....quality food.",5,2017,09,13
226,Poor Experience ,"I had a business meeting in Belfast so myself and my partner picked this hotel which looked quite nice.

We stayed for one night and had room service, my other half had fish and unfortunately was up all night with all the symptoms of food poisoning. I'll leave out the gorey details!

The next morning I had my business meeting at 9-30. We were ready to leave the hotel at 8-45 however the fridge in our room wouldn't open (they use an automated lock system). We had already rang to see could we use the fridge. It took three calls to reception and 30 minutes to open it to get our stuff in it, meaning I miss my meeting. The reason we went to Belfast - very embarrassing. The fridge didn't open because it didn't work, meaning all our stuff was ruined anyway. ¬£268 a night!

That aside, we wouldn't have complained about the food, but missing my meeting and reception taking so long to fix it (when we paid ¬£268 a night and highlighted we needed to leave on time for the meeting) we vented at reception about how poor the service we received during our whole stay. We didn't ask for a refund.

I mention that we didn't ask for a refund because I wouldn't be writing this review if not for what happened next. The manager rang my other half saying that there was nothing wrong with their kitchen (impossible for her to know about each fish to be honest) and that she go to a GP to get confirmation she was sick or a sample. Well we hardly thought of not flushing the toilet. 

All that was required was a simple apology for the uncooked fish and the fridge issue meaning we missed out on the meeting. But no, she jumped down our throat. A wholey unpleasant stay in Belfast and if you're spending over ¬£200, don't stay here. Get a bit of value for your money and get treated with respect. ",1,2017,09,13
226,Underwhelmed!,"My husband and I plus 2 other family members took 2 rooms for one night in this city centre hotel, greeted by an excellent female member of staff who made us feel very welcome, however our rooms understandably weren't ready (it was only 11.45am) so we left our bags and headed off for the day, we returned at 5.30pm. The Fitzwilliam hotel neighbors the Opera House and the Europa hotel with close proximity to the famous Crown bar, so a great location for sights such as City hall, the Titanic quarter and Cathedral quarter plus many other points of interests. However when we returned we were left underwhelmed with a number of things in our room; the quality of the bed linen, towels and cleanliness of the room was very disappointing for a 5 star hotel. I had to move a very heavy piece of furniture in order to plug in my phone as the one and only easily accessible point was being used for something else. As I had to pull out the unit I could see quite a lot of dust along the plug units which suggested the room hadn't been ""deep"" cleaned between occupancies! The fact that the fridge was locked left us totally perplexed .....we have never encountered this before üòü The room was a corner room on the second floor (202), albeit bright and initially pleasant enough, cleanliness was an issue particularly in the bathroom around the shower door and behind the bathroom door. As we were only staying for one night on a DB&B basis we went to the dining room for dinner in the hope of restoring our faith in the Fitzwilliam only to be served 3 out of 4 inedible main courses.  When ordering our meal we were asked how we liked our steak & we requested ""medium"" only to be told we could only have medium rare or well done.......another first for us!!!!! Airing on the side of caution and confused we reluctantly went for ""well done"" hoping the chef wouldn't overcook (as most chefs hate overlooking meat) & because we don't like rare meat. Well you can guess the outcome... ...tough, tasteless, cheap cut of meat which honestly was so bad we had to send the dishes back. However, to add insult to injury the restaurant supervisor came back from the kitchen and began to tell us ""well actually if you order steak well done....etc etc"" before my husband had to stop her and suggest that being of a certain age we have been eating steak for quite a long time and reminded her we were left with little or no choice as to how our steak was being served!!!!!!!! My point albeit long winded is that when we sent back 3 untouched inedible meals she should have just apologized and offered an alternative but instead she smiled and assured us that we could pick whatever dessert we wished (all part of the 4 course prepaid meal) and we could completely forget about the supplement! Mmm! Basically they shrugged their shoulders so when we mentioned the scenario to reception at check out the next morning we were offered the chance to speak to the restaurant manager,  however decided against it because we just felt we were going to get another shrug and we just weren't in the mood!!!! Hotel is just not up to what we feel is 5star standardüòü",3,2017,09,13
226,The Fitzwilliam,"Wonderful hotel, we stay here each time we visit Belfast as it is central for theatre and shopping and are really well looked after by the well trained staff.  The whole ambience of the hotel is good and worthy of its 5stars.",5,2017,09,12
226,Very Good ,"Great place, we stopped by for one night, prior to flying out of Belfast City. Great experience, clean, modern with excellent staff. Location was great for downtown walking and airport rendezvous. Had a small bite late in bar and it was good too.",4,2017,09,12
226,A wonderful hotel right in the heart of a nice city with an impressive history,"The room was spotless. We've had a Superior King room with a nice view on Grosvenor Road and the mountains in the west. The room was large and had a couch in the corner, looking out of the window. Nice touch: Two USB sockets on the side of the large and very comfortable bed. A large shower and separate bath. Room cleaning was very flexible and compatible with the sometimes late departure from our room. Fresh water (and two chocolates) every day. A good breakfast buffet with a lot of choice and good service.

I know it's nitpicking, but the mains and USB sockets were on one side of the bed only. The other side had a table but no way to charge your mobile.",5,2017,09,12
226,Rooms and service excellent. Food not so good,Stayed in a suite with my wife could not fault the room. The coffee selection in the room is a great touch as are all the room facilities. Staff very friendly and welcoming. The only let down is the food. Dinner was well presented but lacking flavour and cooked breakfast was definitely not freshly cooked,4,2017,09,12
226,Beautiful room in luxury hotel,"We stayed at the Fitzwilliam for 4 nights. The room was exceptional on the corner of the hotel with views up both intersecting roads. The room was spacious and comfortable  and exceeded our expectations. The hotel was central to everything. All the staff - in reception, concierge, service and in the restaurant - were very friendly and helpful. Thoroughly enjoyed our stay.",5,2017,09,12
226,Favorite hotel of our 10-day holiday!,"The Fitzwilliam was amazing in every way! Our room wasn't quite ready when we arrived, so we went for a stroll around Belfast (its central accessibility to the city is superb!) to pass the time. When we returned, it had been placed in our room -- and what a fabulous room it was! We had an early bird rate for a deluxe king corner room looking onto Grosvenor and Great Victoria Street. The in-room selection of teas and Nespresso machine were very welcome; only wish they gave one more biscuit per day.  

But the bed! The bed was beyond comfortable. We had no problem crashing after a long day of touring -- the kind of feeling you get from your own bed at home. The bathroom was extremely spacious with both walk-in shower and separate tub that could be exposed to the bedroom via shutter doors.

We wanted to enjoy a pre-dinner cocktail in the hotel bar, but it was unfortunately deserted in the early evening and still rather slow when we returned from dinner. 

The staff was amazing with accommodating a very early departure by providing a boxed breakfast for me and my partner bright and early. I was mildly devastated to miss it since our Fitzwilliam breakfasts from the previous morning were so tasty.

Thank you for a memorable stay! We would certainly come again.",5,2017,09,11
226,Excellent hotel,Very nice hotel. Friendly and helpful staff. Gorgeous room and nice touch with turn down service and chocolates on pillows. Close to all attractions. Ease of walking to Titanic experience. Close to sightseeing tours and some excellent pubs and restaurants. ,5,2017,09,11

226,A delightful hotel,"This was an absolutely delightful stay at the Fitzwilliam Hotel. We were upgraded to a suite which was superb - we entered the room to find rose petals on the bed, chocolates and a plate with 'Happy Anniversary' in icing. It was a lovely surprise. The staff at the hotel are beautifully dressed with Top hats which makes you feel very special. The hotel is ideally situated within easy walking distance of the town and local attractions and historic sites. The restaurant and bar were enjoyable spaces and the breakfast was delicious and cooked to order. Service was excellent.",5,2017,09,11
226,Top marks,"Really enjoyed our stay,the staff all most helpful, plenty to eat at breakfast and afternoon tea, two nights on the Sip and stay was most relaxing, would recommend this hotel to all although could not afford to do this on a regular basis.‚ò∫

226,Weekend in Belfast,"Fab hotel, very central location with lovely friendly staff. Beautiful rooms. The hotel was right next to the pick up point for our GOT location tour so couldnt have been any more convienient and the concierge made sure that the tour company were made aware of our new designated pick up. All in a fabulous weekend spent in a very beautiful part of the world. ",5,2017,09,11
226,Good location,"Pretty much everything was first class about our stay here. Only the bar was a bit of a let down as there seemed to be no attention paid to serving customers in turn. However, this was a minor point in what was overall an excellent experience.",5,2017,09,11
226,Great hotel in heart of Belfast,"A great place to stay in heart of the city. We were there for only one night but would defintely stay there again if we return to Belfast-
Only issue was that parking garage was full so,we had to park across the street but hotel compensated us for the parking fee.",5,2017,09,10
226,Truly deserves 5 stars,"Stayed here for a 5 day business trip, so can't really comment on its value. But all facilities were truly 5 star, as were all staff encountered.  Nothing was too much trouble.  Also, this is well located for other travels, only a few minutes walk from the main bus/train station Great Victoria Street.",5,2017,09,10
226,WONDERFUL STAY &'PERFECT IN EVERY WAY,"Stayed here as going to opera house & arrived by train & perfect in every way. We have stayed before &'is a class hotel, perfectly situated & just what we wanted.

If you are visiting Belfast then you stay here. Location, quality of hotel, great offers, etc.",5,2017,09,10
226,Birthday trip,We had a lovely overnight stay at the fitzwilliam. The staff were extremely helpful and friendly. Our room was very cosy with lots of nice touches like radio playing classical music on arrival and a welcome pack with comfort items. As it was a birthday treat there was macaroons and a card waiting for me in my room. The room was spacious and very comfortable. There was an excellent tea and coffee facilities in the room and a well stocked minibar. I couldn't find hanging hooks for my coat or bathrobe but that was the only bothersome part of the stay. ,5,2017,09,10
226,Great location and service,"We found the Fitzwilliam was a perfect location for seeing Belfast.  The service was fantastic, especially the Concierge on duty.  They were able to confirm a private taxi tour of  Belfast which was wonderful. Our room was spacious and comfortable.",5,2017,09,09
226,Attending BSides Belfast,"I stayed at the Fitzwilliam to attend the Bsides Belfast conference. The hotel was in the center of town. The staff was very friendly and helpful. My room was nice, clean and spacious. I really enjoyed my stay at the Fitzwilliam and highly recommend it.",5,2017,09,09
226,Very central,"Easy check-in, nice room, great shower, really good breakfast, easy access to everywhere in Belfast city. We had a room on the 8th floor so that we wouldn't hear the noise of traffic from the street as it is quite a busy area. We were able to walk back from the Merchant easily. What's not to like!",4,2017,09,09
226,A truly luxurious hotel,"Stayed at the hotel for three nights with my brother while visiting friends in Belfast and doing some sightseeing. From the minute we were greeted by the concierge team to the minute we left the hotel we were extremely pleased with the experience we had. The staff could not have been any more professional and friendly and we would like to mention Zi, Liam and Joey who all have greatly contributed to our amazing stay at the hotel. The room could not be faulted and we were happy with everything; very clean, well serviced and spacious. The view outside the window may not have been great however we had peace and quiet at night which was great. The breakfast was very good with a wide variety of choice. We also had drinks in the bar on two occasions. The cocktails were delightful however choice of beers on tap was very limited. We will definitely stay at the hotel when returning to Belfast in the future.",5,2017,09,09
226,Couldn't Fault a Thing,"My husband and I have just returned from a short break in Belfast and this hotel was perfect for our stay. It has an excellent location, it's beautifully decorated and the staff couldn't do enough to help. Liam in particular, one of the concierge staff, was very knowledgeable and quick to help or make recommendations for places to go during our stay. 

In addition, when calling downstairs to ask for ""real"" milk it was brought up straight away and we were made to feel like nothing was too much trouble. 

Breakfast was delicious, so much freshly prepared goodies to choose from. 

I would definitely stay here again or recommend to a friend. ",5,2017,09,09
226,Corner room with a penthouse feel on the fifth floor,"Recently stayed here in August for three days and it was a nice halfway point break on our tour of the Ireland.  It was also perfect for exploring downtown. It sits two buildings down from the Europa and right across from the Irish Tour Tickets office where you can book tours across Northern Ireland to see sites like the seacoast, Giant‚Äôs Causeway, or even the Games of Throne tour.  The latter tour taking you to various film locations for the HBO series which is mainly shot in Northern Ireland (and Belfast). 

The staff is perhaps the most important piece of a hotel‚Äôs impression to their customer and the Fitzwilliam staff did not disappoint. Everything started off well thanks mainly in part to the welcoming manner and professionalism of Jara, the duty manager when we arrived in town.  Her staff were just as charming as she was and they always made it a pleasure to talk to them whenever we had a question.  We ended upgrading to a Deluxe Suite which gave us an incredible corner room on the fifth floor and a beautiful view of the Belfast streets below as well as the cathedral style building known as the Spires Conference & Exhibition Center.  

The room was excellent as you can see from our pictures and the housekeeping staff did a great job keeping it to that standard. The gentlemen who performed duties a concierge, valet, and bellhop all rolled into one were professional and friendly as well.  Only problem we had was a loss of our initial dinner reservation and the hotel and its main restaurant having no record of us having dining package despite several emails with the hotel prior to our stay.  However, they quickly fixed the problem and it did not detract from our comfortable and wonderful stay at the hotel. We will try to return to the hotel again.",5,2017,09,08
226,Glad to be back - really great hotel,"As usual, quick friendly check-in.  Reception helped find the quietest room possible for me (rubbish sleeper whilst away)...  Room (516) was good size - no view (back of hotel) - but this was a work trip and only using the room for sleep and wash etc

As usual brilliant breakfast - first morning had the mushroom omelette - next morning the full Fitzwilliam Fry - thoroughly recommend :)

All the staff excellent - really comfy hotel.",5,2017,09,08
226,Superb executive room stay!! ,"My recent return to Belfast's FW was faultless; from check-in to departure, everything was absolutely perfect. 

The service was friendly, warm, hospitable & professional without being stuffy. 

The bedroom was stylishly furnished & beautifully appointed with immaculate house keeping standards throughout. 

Breakfast in bed was as fresh as it would be had taken breakfast in the dining room & the presentation of the breakfast trolley was faultless. 

The FW will remain my preferred go to Hotel when in Belfast; because not only is its' location just brilliantly central & accessible to the City Centre, but because it's an all round first class establishment. 

Thank you all. ",5,2017,09,07
226,"Luxurious, good for wheelchair","On tour with wheelchair group.  Excellent rooms, enough space for wheelchair.  Very good roll-in shower with small but adequate fold-down shower seat.  Excellent service, restaurant, amenities.  Very friendly.",5,2017,09,07
226,A Hidden Gem In the City,"What a simply delightful experience it was staying in The Fitzwilliam Hotel. Everyone was so friendly professional and accommodating. The rooms were lovely, well appointed and every little details had been thought through. It was good value superb location and delightfully understated. I would thoroughly recommend it to anyone.  ",5,2017,09,07
226,Great all round ,Stayed here over the weekend with my son. We were on a visit to Belfast. Staff were so helpful and chatty to my son. Facilities are excellent. Evening food was was delicious and reasonably priced for 5*. Breakfast was also delicious and catered for my son. Will definitely visit again and stay longer. ,5,2017,09,06
226,Excellent spot for Belfast break,"The Fitzwilliam is absolutely beautiful and perfect for your Belfast stay. Rooms are incredibly comfortable with plush beds and a fantastic bathroom. Bed linens were luxurious, robes soft and fluffy, bath towels excellent. Great location for the shopping district or evening out. ",5,2017,09,04
226,Made our weekend,"EVERYTHING was amazing.. had hotel booked to propose to my girlfriend and had flowers and champagne ordered, they left an amazing layout in the room with that to greet us....room was fantastic, 4 course meal was probably the best I've ever had, same for breakfast... great staff and just lots of little extra attention to detail from the hotel that's really nice! Made our weekend!",5,2017,09,04
226,Very disappointed,"I stayed at the Fitzwilliam recently for a weekend with my husband and 2 year old daughter for my birthday.

On arrival, inspection of the exterior and interior of the hotel was stunning unfortunately it didn't live up to these first impressions. 

We were awoken at half five in the morning by the fire alarm. We tried ringing reception however understandably it was engaged with the volume of calls going through. I looked out our room door for some sign to see if we needed to evacuate but no staff members were to be seen. At this stage my husband decided to go down to reception to see what the issue was as we were unsure if we needed to leave. There were other guests looking out the doors of their rooms at this stage not knowing what was happening and still no sign of any staff. When my husband reached reception he was told that there had been a flood and there was no need for concern. We finally settled our two year old and went back to sleep when we were woken an hour later once again by the alarm. 

As we couldn't get our two year old back to sleep we got ready and went down early for breakfast. My husband said good morning to a member of staff on arrival to the dining room who didn't acknowledge us. My husband then gave him our room number to which he responded by ushering us to a table with a point of a finger. We were disturbed during breakfast by the fire alarm going off again ! Service was generally bad that morning with another guest complaining about bread full of mould as we were leaving. The service the second morning was much better along with our nights sleep the second night.

When staying in a 5 star hotel I expect that you are paying for a nights sleep which we didn't receive and great service which also wasn't the case so for those reasons I felt the stay was extremely disappointing. Although I realise that the incident which occurred was out of the hotels control I still believe that the way it was dealt with after could have been a lot better. My husband complained on check out. He had to wait for the manager who explained the reason for the alarm going off. She gave him her business card for him to send her an email next time we stay there..... the generic answer for every hotel dealing with a complaint. 

Lastly I would just like to mention that the highlight of our stay which was the service we received from the concierge in particular Declan and Liam who both greeted us on arrival and helped us on our departure.They were kind and friendly throughout our stay giving us great recommendations and were very helpful with directions. Professional at all times and always at hand to help with a buggy, bags, car or umbrella. No task was too big or small for them. They were absolute gentlemen, fantastic at their jobs. I have given this review 2 stars as I feel that it was earned by these two staff members. It's a pity the rest of our stay wasn't to the same standard.",2,2017,09,03
226,"Well located, 4 star","Well located for a weekend in Belfast. 5 mins to the City Hall and thus easy walk to retail etc. room was modern though a bit dark, early morning alarm was dealt with though not explained(!), breakfast OK, staff very helpful. Nice hotel in the centre of Belfast",4,2017,09,03
226,"Pretty, but thats about it.","This hotel is a 'fancy' hotel, and the focus is very much on the interior design.  They put on a good show with great service, and the rooms are very pretty, but once you start to settle in you'll start to see that whoever designed this hotel missed so many key details of the set up/function.  A pretty & clean room is of course important, but so is being able to use your hotel room & hotel facilities comfortably during your stay.  I see another review labeled ""style over substance"" - I agree.

I wouldn't stay here again.

Here's what I noticed during my 3 night stay:
- I ordered a pizza from room service that said ""tomato, basil & goat cheese"".  The pizza came with a lot of roasted red onions on it, and no basil.  The tomatoes were sundried, not regular.  I called back to double check they'd sent the right thing, and they said that this was correct.  Not as described on the menu.
- The room comes with a coffee maker/supplies, however I couldn't find it anywhere at first.  After a lot of inspection I found that the thin 'floor length mirror' over in the far corner of the room next to the bed/nightstand was actually a door that opened to reveal a small closet.  The coffee supplies, cups, hot water kettle & french press were tucked onto 1 of the shelves.  In order to utilize, you need to carry everything over to the desk yourself, takes a couple trips.  Such a poor set-up!
- The shower glass door doesn't slide so there's no way to turn on the shower from reaching in from the outside - you have to get into the shower and reach to the back to turn it on, which means your arm will get wet while turning on.  And at first, of course, thats cold water.  
- The bathroom sink was pedestal-style with only a very small glass shelf over it.  There's barely anywhere to put your basic toiletries for 1 person.  My toiletry bag barely balanced on the little glass shelf.  As a female with a separate make-up bag I ended up having to keep the toilet shut so I could put stuff on top of it next to the sink.  When I had to use the toilet, I'd put my makeup bag literally in the sink temporarily.  If there were more than 1 person in the room, I have no idea how that would work!
- There's a couch & side tables & hanging pendant lights blocking your access to the curtains, so to close the curtains you need to basically stand on the couch to reach over
- The gym was little more than closet with a couple machines",2,2017,09,03

226,Our 2 night stay in Belfast,"All in all highly recommendable Hotel in Belfast. 
Great Staff always friendly and there to help. 
Personally I find the price a bit steep for a night in Belfast however the room was great, the breakfast was of high quality and the overall location and quality of the Hotel are superior. 

Only have 2 little cons for the Hotel in itself: 

- Our neighbours room door banged shut and we could clearly hear this in our room (even thinking someone had come into our room) quite annoying of course when you want to sleep in and your neighbour is up at 6am. 

- On the second day of our breakfast we ordered Pancakes and it took an exceptional 32 mins to arrive as well as upon arrival they were probably the only thing on the Breakfast menu that was not top notch quality.

226,Lovely!,"Beautiful hotel, superb location, friendly, helpful staff. Lovely, spacious room, my only criticism would be that the TV was not placed where you could see it either from the sofa or bed, so we moved it! The view onto the back was poor, but that aside, I would recommend this hotel!",5,2017,08,29
226,Wonderful hotel ,"We had a lovely stay at The Fitzwilliam. The rooms were spotless, the bed was very comfy and the staff were very accommodating and pleasant. 

The air con was put on during the turn down service, we had forgotten to turn it on before we went out and so the room was lovely and cool when we returned. 

Can't wait to stay here again! ",5,2017,08,28
226,Beautiful Hotel and Great Staff,"The Fitzwilliam is centrally located - within steps of some of Belfast's best restaurants and bars.

226,Smashing hotel! Top class! ,"I'm just about to book a night away for me and my hubby and the ""F"" (as my wee daughter calls it because of the Gold F on the exterior) is the only hotel we revisit time and again in Belfast. From the moment you set foot inside the reception you are welcomed. And you feel like a very important and privileged guest. We love the rooms and the huge comfortable bed. And the bathrooms have little extras like designer shampoos and body lotions. I've been know to take two baths a day! We need to chill and there's nothing nicer than relaxing while overlooking the city below. The suites are beautiful but generally we opt for a superior room. As for breakfast it's fresh and there's so much choice. The staff are very helpful. Special mention to Leo the concierge for his directions the last time we stayed! I'm always cautious about recommending places but I've no fear this time. You'd be hard pushed to find fault with anything at this hotel. From the rooms to the bar and restaurant it's top class. Parking is across the road at McCauslands and you get a special overnight rate if you show your bill to them. Denise ",5,2017,08,28

226,Exceeding Expectations,Stayed here on the 23rd August 2017 and will definitely return should I need to stay in Belfast in the future.

Staff were extremely welcoming and friendly. I will be looking for a reason to return.,5,2017,08,26
226,"Lovely hotel with professional, friendly staff","The rooms are clean, modern and well equipt. The bathrooms are big with a waterfall shower and large bath.

Such a lovely hotel with equally lovely staff. Brian in the restaurant was probably the most professional  (I assume) manager I'd come across in recent years. Very warm personality, top-class service and the dining experience, along with the great food, was all the more pleasant for his presence. Breakfast was amazing too. Very clean hotel. I'd highly recommend it and will return again.",5,2017,08,25

226,Unimpressed with tired room,"My wife and I spent our wedding night at the fitzwilliam in July 2011 in a suite, the room was beautiful and very well presented, we really enjoyed the experience. We haven't returned since for various reasons but I decided to book a room so that we could celebrate my wife's birthday in style, I cant say I'll be returning. 

When we arrived there wasn't any clear signage as to where the valet service took place, a minor complaint but something that could easily be addressed. The only real complaint I have was the state of the room, it was very tired, not what I expected when booking a room at such a hotel, I normally don't complaint but felt the need to mention it when I left, the reception staff said they would pass my comments to the manager and I hope they do. A lighting fixture in the bathroom was loose and the mirror had chipped, a light switch by the bed was missing, the light switches were temperamental and didn't always work, the curtains had multiple tears and the base of the bed was visibly chipped from contact with a vacuum. Again not major problems but given what I paid for the room and the reputation of the hotel I was surprised and unimpressed, we both agreed we would rather have stayed in the hilton, we've stayed there several times over the years for nights out in Belfast, its cheaper and the rooms are always immaculate.",3,2017,08,25
226,Fitzwilliam,Great location and room was very big and spacious. The amenities were very good in the room but the wifi connectionwas just hopeless. In the end we connected to the jury's inn wifi across the road from our room because it was a more reliable connection! ,5,2017,08,25
226,Belfast break,"Great hotel, friendly very helpful staff, room excellent although being from the country we weren't used to street noise so found it slightly noisy, breakfast had great choices - would highly recommend.",4,2017,08,25
226,Perfect night away,"Perfect location and close to train & bus station.

Front desk staff were all very friendly and attentive. Upon check in we were told we had been given a complementary upgrade. While our room was not ready we were made more than welcome in the bar and decided to get some food and drinks while we waited. Food was lovely and not badly priced. Staff were very pleasant and friendly.
When we got to our room it was lovely. Nice sofa area, large bed, perfect bathroom, sound system, tea & coffee facilities, everything needed for an enjoyable night. 
Upon returning to the hotel after our night out we found the room had been given a turn down service with little chocolates left on the pillows. 
The only problem I had (and it's not a major one) was the plugs in the room seemed to be all grouped together, could do with one at each side of the bed. 

We had a great nights stay at the Fitzwilliam and would highly recommend it.  Will definitely stay again in the near future.

226,Poor housekeeping ,"Stayed at the Fitzwilliam as part of a hen party, the cocktail class was brilliant and Sean who took the class was fantastic. Had a ball, however pity we couldn't say the same about the housekeeping.  

Dropped something in between the two single beds and when pulled out the beds there was a stale half eaten burger lying between the beds!!!! Disgusting!!! Reported it to reception who said they would send someone up immediately.  When we returned to the room the burger had been lifted but the floor had not been hoovered the bed was left lying out so much so that it was pushed up against the bedside table which was nearly on its side!!   Rang reception and asked someone be sent up immediately to see the way the room had been left. Got an apology but not really good enough. 

All other rooms within the party had their beds turned down with a chocolate left on the bed and water on bedside table at bedtime however this did not happen in our room.  The dust was thick on the window ledge and to top it off the TV did not work.  We just feel that this is not good enough for a five star hotel and for the price that we all paid.  ",1,2017,08,21
226,Mid week break,"Really nice room with great details, bathroom was great , staff never mentioned the parking was extra so there was a charge of sixty pounds to leave the car there, we would not have minded if this was explained prior to checking out . I had mentioned it was a big birthday of my partners the hotel did nothing to mark an occasion and we were staying the full week .guys on the door were very helpful and couldn't do enough",3,2017,08,21
226,Absolutely Spectacular,"Arguably one of the nicest two hotels we stayed at over the past 30 days travelling around Europe. We stayed in Venice, Salzburg, Prague, Budapest, Zagreb, Split, Portoroz and Dublin. It's a shame we couldn't stay longer but we will be back.",5,2017,08,21

226,"Outstanding service, great rooms, centrally located","We went to Belfast for a family visit. One thing that I will always remember about the Fitzwilliam (and Belfast in genral) is that everyone is so friendly and nice (even that is an understatement). The Fitzwilliam was a great hotel. The rooms very clean, bright, and modern. The breakfast offered at the hotel is average (good food if you just want to relax and stay at the hotel). That being said, the hotel is located right in the middle of the city, so a good breakfast place is a short walk away. All in all, the Fitzwilliam was a great hotel, with great rooms and outstanding service. I hope to be back.",5,2017,08,21
226,Birthday Weekend Bliss,"The Fitzwilliam is a fabulous hotel. The staff made sure I had a lovely birthday weekend, which included macaroons in our room and cocktail vouchers for the bar! Couldn't recommend the Fitzwilliam highly enough. ",5,2017,08,21
226,Couples enjoy,"Lovely hotel, excellent service and in a great location. Not too expensive considering it was a 5 star hotel. I got the best deal through their own web site. Would definitely recommend this hotel for couples. ",5,2017,08,20
226,Enjoyable,The hotel is very clean and comfortable. It is ideally located with walking distance to the shopping streets and lots of really good restaurants nearby. The concierge were extremely helpful with information on what to see and do. We really enjoyed our stay.,4,2017,08,20
226,Brilliant hotel,"This is a great example of what a 5 Star hotel should be. Courteous staff, who can't do enough for you. The rooms are beautiful, clean and well presented. My only complaint would be that the mirrors in the main room is hard to work with as it is antique and it's not very well lit for putting on make up etc - the same is of the bathroom. But the mood lighting you get in exchange gives the room a wonderful luxury feel. In the morning, I asked for a late check out and they were wonderfully accommodating. Checkout was quick, easy and very friendly.

The only time where the hotel lets itself down is the breakfast offering. Having experienced other 5 star hotel breakfasts, the choice of goods isn't great and expansive and my eggs benedict (which to me is always a measure of a good breakfast kitchen) was a bit cold and not very well presented. I also had to wait a long time for it.

All in all, a great stay and I can't wait to go back.",5,2017,08,20

Great attention to detail including the nice touch of chocolates on your pillow st night time. Fantastic choice for breakfast, eggs benedict was a delight. ",5,2017,08,20
226,Central Belfast August 17-19,"The Fitzwilliam is right in the middle of everything downtown Belfast. Nice and modern without overdoing it. Lots of mirrors though, everywhere but the ceiling. Rooms are very good size even to an American. Can get a nice king (2 twins together). The sofa is shockingly hard. Don't plop down on it! There are 2 radios in the rooms. One is on when you arrive and could disturb your neighbors. We had quite loud neighbors but the front desk and security addressed and resolved the issue quickly. We had rms 505 and 607. 505 has a nice view of the Presbyterian church and a little window ledge but it and 607 (across hall from 605) might be a little close to the elevator (lift) if you're a little sleeper. All in all, a nicely appointed, centrally located hotel with competent attentive staff. ",4,2017,08,19
226,Good,Friendly and welcoming staff who could not do enough for you. Beautiful rooms with lovely service. Our view was not great and quite a lot of noise from passing traffic but that can not be helped I suppose. ,4,2017,08,19
226,"Excellent service, Excellent hotel!","Pros: Fantastic service - staff were very helpful, including locating an emery board unexpectedly needed. Room was fantastic, well-appointed with current decor. The bath products and bathroom were beautiful (perfect soaker tub). We had booked a reservation for dinner at a local restaurant, but the restaurant lost the booking - the concierge (Philip) made us a reservation for the same time slot at another local restaurant that was fantastic. We booked a city tour through the concierge as well, and a shuttle dropped us at the pick-up point. The staff also valet parked our car, and loaded our luggage into the vehicle upon retrieval. We would definitely stay at this hotel again.

Cons: Valet parking was a bit pricey (¬£17) and was the only option for parking. Water pressure in the shower could have been a bit better.",5,2017,08,18
226,Best hotel in Belfast,"We stayed at The Fitzwilliam Hotel August 11 - 14, 2017 during our extended honeymoon and it was perfect!! Staff were so attentive, kind and knowledgeable, the food and service was excellent.  We would only stay here when we return to Belfast. We loved this place!",5,2017,08,17
226,Great service and a great place to stay,"I recently stayed here for a night over the weekend I can say I wasn't disappointed. 

The rooms were luxurious, big and clean. As hotels go it's one of the best I've stayed in. I would thoroughly recommend you stay here if you are thinking of stopping in Belfast for a few days. It's very central, good access to all restaurants, bars and local amenities. Staff are great, the food is good and the bar is exceptional. I would recommend the cocktails, the staff are even willing to whip up a cocktail of your own designed if it's not on the menu. 

The only reason I have not given this five star, is that for me a five star hotel would usually have a pool or a spa of some kind. But this in no way detracts from the rest of what was a great experience.

Book this hotel, you will not be disappointed. ",4,2017,08,17

226,Lovely Stay,"Had a lovely stay recently at The Fitzwilliam. Decor is Fab, Food was lovely, Staff were incredibly friendly (really the most attentive and caring I have met in any hotel).

Hotel is located perfectly for anything you would need or want to do in Belfast City.

This was my second time staying and I would definitely come back. I had booked the date night package and the beds in the room were made up as two separate beds although beside each other, separate sheets and duvets. We lifted the bases and hooked them together but the mattresses separated if we tried to sleep near the middle of the bed. This was a little disappointing and I found it strange given the overall standard of the hotel. 

The last time I stayed there was a turn down service with chocolates left on your pillow, I thought this was a lovely touch but this seems to have been stopped since then. 

Overall couldn't fault much and would come back... Hopefully next time in the same bed for our 'Date Night'",5,2017,08,16
226,Enjoyable,"Stayed one night on a short trip to Belfast! A lovely hotel with friendly, polite staff, especially the front desk team. Ashlea (i think) checked us in and out and helped us with making evening plans.

Breakfast was fab, one of the best hotel breakfasts we've had.

We got a comp upgrade to a superior room! Room was beautiful, extremely clean with AC. The bed however was the one negative i have - it was 2 beds pushed together so come morning they had seperated slightly!

Overall an amazing stay, thanks to Ashlea and Matthew (at the booking stage!)",4,2017,08,16

Excellent suggestions provided by concierge Philip for places to see and eat to make the most of our trip.

The room was spacious and had everything we needed. The hairdryer in the room didn't work but 2 minutes after I called down I received a replacement, so very efficient. 

Breakfast was lovely, an excellent choice. On both mornings our toast was forgotten though and we had to ask again.

We had night cap cocktails in the bar both nights and my espresso martini on Saturday was one of the best I've ever had (and I've tried a few!). The service was the waiters was a little slow.

The hotel is in a very Central location, where you are surrounded by lovely restaurants and bars, with short walks to main local attractions. It was an excellent spot for getting around Belfast. 

Overall an excellent stay. Thank you!

226,Great short stay in Belfast,"We stayed here for a short trip to Belfast and it was the perfect base for our travels - luxurious enough to turn a brief visit into something a little more exciting, with friendly and efficient staff and a great location in the city center handy for all attractions. Our room was well appointed, clean and most importantly had a great bed for some needed shut-eye. We'd certainly return if ever we came back to Belfast and can heartily recommend the hotel.

Its the small things that make the difference. Concierge ready to take our bags and car keys, the room ready, cot already in the room. I had a 6 week old baby and the team could not have been more helpful. Staff have great ""cope on"". They are looking to provide a service to you rather than waiting to be asked. ",5,2017,08,14

Bar is a bit odd, really overstaffed, kept getting asked by different people if I would like another drink, ended up in the Europa hotel bar as is was less fussy",5,2017,08,13
226,Overall a great experience,"Probably not as ostentatious as other 5 star hotels, but it ticks most boxes! The room was comfortable, the location was great and the breakfasts were top drawer. Will definitely consider using this hotel again.",4,2017,08,13
226,Super Service,"Lovely hotel. Attentive and professional staff. Fabulous cocktails and great breakfast.
 We had a wonderful stay and everything was super from start to finish. The staff were very helpful and nothing was too much trouble.",5,2017,08,13
226,Just perfect,"Just a great experience. Wonderful place, clean, friendly, well positioned. The food was good and the room was gorgeous. The staff professional and kind. Every necessity satisfied professionally. Close to the city center.",5,2017,08,13
226,Superb stay in Belfast,"Excellent situation for visiting the whole City of Belfast.
The staff is very friendly and efficient. 
The room was comfortable and spacious, and even quit during the night.
The Hotel is absolutely to recommend.",5,2017,08,12
226,Wonderful relaxing experience,"First class attention from all staff. We were going to a concert in waterfront on Thursday night and on Friday two members of staff enquired about our concert.  Treated as individuals, would return again",5,2017,08,12
226,Great Hotel and Staff,"The Fitzwilliam is consistently an amazing hotel! I stay here every time I'm in Belfast, and I'm constantly amazed at how perfect each stay is. I travel heavily for work. No matter where I've stayed, the Fitzwilliam always stands out as the best. ",5,2017,08,12
226,Family holiday.,Excellent family holiday in Belfast. Hotel was lovely. Beautiful rooms and interior. Staff were extremely friendly and helpful. Great location and close to everything. I will definitely visit again. üòäüòä,5,2017,08,12
226,Great hotel in the center of Belfast ,"The fitzwilliam is a great hotel with a nice lobby, well appointed rooms and good food.  The rooms are spacious with very nice bathrooms.  The restaurants are good - breakfast is quite good.  The fitzwilliam is in good location easy to walk to any place in city center.  ",4,2017,08,11
226,Excellent,Lovely clean and modern hotel. Very central. Comfortable beds. Very friendly and helpful staff. Good selection for breakfast. Would definitely recommend and return here. Nice bar with evening entertainment.,5,2017,08,08
226,Our most luxurious hotel stay,"Fitzwilliams Hotel is top notch, from the room to the location in the city. The concierge is very professional and incredibly friendly. The rooms and bathrooms are gorgeous. Zi, one of the hotel concierge, showed us to our room and showed us how everything worked and where different amenities were located. He also recommended dinner locations, but make sure you look at the online reviews first- we went to one that wasn't as good as we had hoped. Otherwise, they took care of our bookings for a Black Taxi Tour and made recommendations to see the Titanic Museum which was well worth it. This hotel is also in the heart of the city, so we didn't have to walk too far to see the sights.",5,2017,08,08
226,Fitzwilliam hotel,"Pleased with the accommodations and the hotel staff.  Location is within walking distance of City Hall, restaurants and shopping.  We did have dinner both nights of our stay.  With a tour group, so not sure of entire menu.  Typical European style breakfast.",4,2017,08,08
226,Dimly lit and TOO much tog,"We stayed here for three nights as guests at a wedding. We found the corridors to be dark and dimly lit and were infuriated by the low level of lighting in the bathroom. My wife ended upsitting on the edge of the bed trying to see to put on her makeup as the main mirror in the bedroom was a designer mirror for prettiness not practicality. The air conditioning was either too low or too high and in three days we didn't manage to get a comfortable temperature. Why oh why can't we get sheets and a blanket in a luxury hotel? There was way too much 'tog' in the duvet and it was so hot with it on that we had to dispense with it. No blanket available. The fitness centre had three machines, one of which was broken and the restaurant chairs a designer's dream and a user's nightmare, wretchedly uncomfortable. Breakfast was adequate if somewhat over priced. |What we couldn't fault was the friendliness of the staff and the overall cleanliness.",3,2017,08,08
226,Fitzwilliam reminds of era of elegance,"The staff was excellent, friendly, helpful, impeccable. The location is what one would hope for visiting Belfast.  We had breakfast and one dinner in the main dining room and the food was above so many and the breakfast menu or buffet was wonderfully chosen.  The dining room staff was trained well or just that they were exceptional people.",5,2017,08,08
226,Belfast Hotel,Pleasant hotel and convenient to all sites.  I would not recommend dining in their restaurant since the food was not very good and the entree took over an hour to receive.  If it had not been included in our stay we would have left.,4,2017,08,08
226,An excellent stay in the heart of the city,This was not our first stay here but this was by far our best stay. We don't get the same time to enjoy our trips away with new additions to our family but from the moment I lifted that phone to make reservations the staff could not have been more perfect. By far the highlight of the weekend was the female singer in the bar hotel. She was pure perfection. We couldn't have asked for a better stay. ,5,2017,08,08
226,Sunday getaway,Stayed on Sunday night and could not fault the hotel. Had a complimentary upgrade on arrival which was a lovely surprise. Staff were friendly and helpful. Rooms were spotless and very comfortable. Would definitely recommend!! ,5,2017,08,08
226,August 2017 visit Belfast,"Hotel generally excellent, staff very friendly and consierge staff particularly alert and on the ball.
Issue request to check in staff re billing, no feedback received during stay, asked again when leaving, but no record of initial request, and issue still not resolved. 
Excellent rooms, decor somewhat dark and lighting dim, particularly in bar and corridors to rooms.  Best lit area is one shown in photo on site of reception area.
Food very good, spotlessly clean rooms and bathrooms. Breakfast was excellent, though for price I felt it should have been included, not an add-on extra,",4,2017,08,07
226,Belfast Visit,"This has been our third visit at the hotel and we admit Fitzwilliam never disappoints us. A hotel with style, luxury and comfort.
All staff right through the reservation process, check in-out, concierge, room escorting have been very pleasant, helpful and friendly. 
Effective and efficient service. Not to forget the stunning view of the mountains which adds the extra touch. Good selection and delicious breakfast. 
Defo coming back.",5,2017,08,07
226,A touch of luxury,"We thoroughly enjoyed our stay at The Fitzwilliam Hotel Belfast, and wish it could have been more than one night. Everything about it was perfect for us. After two weeks of staying in various Airbnb accommodation, we were happily reminded of the luxury & comfort that staying in a good hotel can be. ",5,2017,08,06
226,Loved it!,"5 Star but laid back hotel. You know you're in a 5 star but the staff is alert without hovering. (I prefer that.) Nicely decorated, good bar, and food. Great location and you can walk to many of the sights downtown. The opera house is right next door and there's a bus tour company across the street. I don't think you could beat this location for convenience and ease of getting around.",5,2017,08,06
226,5 star hotel,Recently redecorated & very stylish. Exceptional touches in the bedrooms. Service was very personal & fast. Great location. Extensive range of cocktails in the modern & homley bar. Will come again soon,5,2017,08,05
226,Gorgeous hotel minus the cheese!,"This is a stunning, modern hotel that impresses from the minute you walk in. The staff are warm and welcoming as is the beautiful fire in the lobby. Our room had floor to ceiling windows with a massive bed (slightly on the hard side) and a very pretty sofa. The walk in shower is so big you could fit a football team in it if you're so inclined and there's also a decent bath. The welcome pack is lovely with mints and ear plugs. The only real issue was that on opening the mini bar we found a half eaten block of Boursin cheese!! It made the products and fridge stink to high heaven and also worried us if something as pungent as this was missed how thorough are the room checks. Our room service breakfast was late and a couple of items missing from the order. However the staff are so friendly and the cocktails so good we probably will return. Plus I'm assuming the fromage probably won't strike twice!!",4,2017,08,05
226,Great place to stay in Belfast,"We really enjoyed our 2 night stay at the Fitzwilliam and would happily have stayed longer. It was very comfortable, stylish, clean and attractive, and our room was also spacious and quiet. The staff were friendly and welcoming, and also the location was central for our arrival and our further explorations of Belfast. The hotel overall has a generous and warm feel to it.",5,2017,08,04
226,Great value pre theatre ,"Had a lovely mid week dinner before going to the grand opera house.  Excellent value at ¬£19.95 for 3 courses. Attentive service without being intrusive. Quick enough so as not to feel rushed to get to the show on time. Great tasting food, would return again prior to next theatre visit. ",5,2017,08,04
226,Comfortable and stylish city center stay,"Lovely contemporary 1920's style decor in the lobby and the rooms. The room was big with marble desk and plush sofa. The bed was comfortable and inviting after a hard day of meetings. Great smelling  and good quality toiletries. Location is really good, close to all the great restaurants of Belfast. Only thing I needed was a complimentary bottle of water in my room and a better hair dryer.",5,2017,08,04
226,Absolutely 5 Star,One of the friendliest places I have ever stayed in   The staff was very helpful always smiling. The breakfast was great. and to top it all so close to the shops.   Checking out was a breeze.   Car out front and luggage all loaded up for us.,5,2017,08,04
226,Wonderful,"This smart, elegant hotel met all our needs for our stay in Belfast.  Very restful after a long day sightseeing.  The staff were very friendly and looked after us well.  It s also very conveniently situated.  We would like to return to Belfast and see more it has to offer and will definitely stay here again.  I have already recommended it to my sister in law.",5,2017,08,03
226,Loved our stay,"We travelled as a family from Limerick to celebrate my parents wedding anniversary at this beautiful hotel in Belfast for a weekend in July and was so happy with our choice. From excellent food, delicious cocktails, friendly staff what more could you ask for. The rooms were so clean, modern and the most comfortable bed ever that I really did not want to leave. I will definitely be visiting this hotel next time I will be in Belfast.",5,2017,08,03
226,"Clean, friendly and comfortable","Having been recommended the Fitzwilliam by a friend we now understand why. Great location, friendly and efficient staff, clean and comfortable rooms and great food. Excellent value for Belfast centre!",5,2017,08,03
226,Package Deal,"Poor experience with our package deal very basic menu for a 5 star hotel, food very salty, breakfast cold and no head chef on duty on a Saturday night,staff needs a lot more training in housekeeping as my experience was very poor and it was for my wife's birthday. ",2,2017,08,02
226,Great hotel,Great hotel and location for Belfast. Wish we had more time to use hotel facilities but whistlestop tour of Belfast and wanted to see as much as we could. Book a double room if you can tends to be bigger than a twin.  ,5,2017,08,02
226,Lovely stay,"Nice room. Good nights sleep, as was quiet, dark and had a comfortable bed. Decor is beautiful and feels luxurious. Staff are friendly and extremely helpful. Only downside is it has become quite an expensive nights stay.",4,2017,08,02
226,Nice hotel,"Will stay again, please see comment about breakfast when included with room, please also stop people from writing 200 character reviews. 

I would also have a few more international adapters handy, I had to go out and buy one. ",4,2017,08,01
226,Simply Perfection,"So how to even begin, I'd spent 3 weeks on holiday half of that in Hungary with my girlfriends family and have in Northern Ireland with my family, I decided our last night needed to be a treat for us and I couldn't have asked for anything better than our stay in Belfast. 
It was faultless from the reception on check in until we left the next day. My first time ever staying in a hotel I didn't want to go home. 
Will be back without a doubt. ",5,2017,08,01
226,Highly recommended,"We spent a long weekend in this hotel and this was our first visit to Belfast. Excellent central location and within walking distance to most main attractions. The hop on hop off bus stops just accross the road.

A cosmopolitan, classy and chic hotel. The room itself was one of the nicest we've experienced on our city breaks. It was very spacious, had a separate seating area and the decor was beautiful. The bathroom had a big rain shower and separate bath inc all the toiletries we required and hairdryer, robes etc. The candle and matches were a nice touch as were the chocolate mints left on our pillow after the evening turn down service. 

Service was professional but very friendly at reception, restaurant and bar.

We can't fault anything about our stay. Would return again in the future and recommended to others. ",5,2017,08,01
226,Fitzwilliam Hotel Assessment,We only stayed overnight so we really don't have anything additional to offer that the questionnaire doesn't already cover. Dinner/breakfast were very good.  Room was very nice and bed was exceptionally comfortable.,5,2017,08,01
226,Five Star,"We visited Belfast in July 2017 and had the pleasure of meeting Declan the very helpful concierge who booked a private tour for us to visit the Game of Thrones sites as well as a city tour. We were lucky to have the tour guide Mark Murphy who in summary is a five-star tour guide! He drives the Game of Thrones cast around and as he is a local, he was so knowledgeable. Going with Mark allowed us to get closer to sites that a tour bus couldn't go too. We learned a lot about Northern Ireland during the tour and highly recommend him. He is a five star tour guide and you will have a great experience. He is also a great photographer and has the experience to tailor your tour according to your needs. The hotel is very accessible to the downtown area of Belfast with a lot of dining options. ",5,2017,07,31
226,High end Belfast,"It is easy to see how this hotel earned 5 stars, and how it maintains its ranking. Very high service from start to finish. The attention to detail in the room was also impressive. We enjoyed great service in the bar. Breakfast can be a bit on the slow side during busy times.",5,2017,07,31
226,Romantic Break,"Reception was beautiful and the staff excel at customer service! All staff were so warm and upbeat.

It was lovely to have both a spacious shower and separate bath in the room. And the linen on the beds was excellent quality.  The bed was very clean and smelt fresh. 

The rooms were very warm, even with the air con on, and very stuffy.  We had the air con on full and the heat off but the room didn't cool alot, and it made night time uncomfortable.  

Also, the design of the room meant there was no seated area for a lady to get ready. The mirror infront of the dressing table was decorated with an ""smoke effect"" making it too dark and unclear to see properly.  Even if a simple stand mirror was provided in each room this would remedy this. 

The breakfast was nice on both mornings.  There was ample choice.  However, there was too long a wait for a member of staff to take our order for a cooked breakfast both mornings despite alot of staff available.  The breakfast portions varied on both days.  

I was left a little dissapointed overall with our experience.",3,2017,07,31
226,Overnight in Belfast,From we arrived until our departure the staff were very attentive. Room had everything you needed. Only problem being in a frontal room it was very noisy with traffic although I enjoyed the view. We will definitely return again.,5,2017,07,31
226,Friendly and luxurious,We stayed here to celebrate my Dads 60th birthday. All staff we met were so friendly and polite. The room was very tastefully decorated in grey and chartreuse. We had cocktails in the bar which were well made and we are dinner in the restaurant which was delicious. We would certainly return. There was a lovely attention to detail but it wasn't fussy! ,5,2017,07,31
226,Martin Lavery,Really enjoyed our stay at the hotel everything was fine just a great weekend all round staff were friendly room was excellent and clean bed very comfortable hotel great location right next door to the opera house as we were going to it on the sat night top marks ,5,2017,07,31
226,Highly recommended,"This is the second time that I stayed at Belfast Fiztwilliam Hotel, each time it has met my expectations and staff was very friendly and efficient. Location is perfect and centrally located. Room is modernly and nicely decorated. ",5,2017,07,30
226,Returning home,"I have lived in England for 20 plus years now but when my partner and I need a break he is always keen to come to my home town, Belfast. We discovered the fitzwilliam 4 years ago, as each time I come home Belfast has morphed into a modern,  chic metropolis, the fitzwilliam being a symbol of all the wonderful potential that Belfast life and people can be, and are. The decor is classy but easy to relax in, the customer service is professional but very friendly and the location is perfect for a tourist day out or a night at the theatre, or both. My partner and I felt at home. ",5,2017,07,30
226,"Great location, beautiful rooms","Hotel is perfectly located in city centre, bars shops, theaters all within walking distance. 
Room decor is beautiful and beds were so comfortable. Very relaxing. 
Staff were extremely helpful and friendly. 
We will definitely return go another visit. ",4,2017,07,30
226,Really poor hotel,"Small rooms that are way to hot to sleep in. Dark corridors which almost hid the cobwebs and dirt. Rough porters who treat luggage and cars poorly, dragging suitcases out and damaging rubber seal on the boot. Lost all trust in staff from their actions and didn't even trust them with keys and with taking the car to tiny outdoor car park. Hotel which is trying to be what it never can be",1,2017,07,30
226,The Fitzwilliam hotel,Stayed here with my daughter what can I say excellent hotel beautiful rooms lovely staff couldn't ask for a better couple of nights.  This hotel is central to everything in the city centre and within easy reach of anything you could possibly need plenty places to eat close by and close to bars and shopping so try it you will love it xx,5,2017,07,29
226,Fabulous stay!,"A hidden gem!  The staff and accommodations are top notch.As soon as we arrived everything from parking to theater tickets to black taxi tour was arranged. ZI,our concierge took care of it all. The  entire staff was wonderful and the room was beautifully appointed.  THe evening turn down service was a pleasant surprise, don't hesitate to book here!",5,2017,07,29
226,Lovely Stay,"Great city centre location, great service from all staff, lovely room, everything you could need has been thought of. I had informed them of my husband's birthday and we were welcomed and wished a 'Happy Birthday' at reception. Wouldn't hesitate to book again.",5,2017,07,29
226,Excellent,"Everything was very excellent and I was very satisfied with the accommodation and I can only recommend people who want to enjoy comfort and well-being. Very friendly staff, comfortable and clean rooms, perfect and tasty food, super hotel location",5,2017,07,28
226,Saturday Night Luxury,"Lovely hotel, very friendly and chatty staff, reception efficient. Reported a smell in the bathroom at 8pm before we went out for dinner, wasn't sorted on our return at 12.30, hotel was full so couldn't move room. Wasn't the fault of the duty manager who was very helpful but poor for a 5 star hotel. They were good enough to waive the charge but rightly so. Couldn't fault the staff and the breakfast was really lovely. ",4,2017,07,26
226,Beautiful hotel in great location,"We were so impressed by the gracious decor and found the location very convenient to everything we wanted to do.  The staff were welcoming & always eager to help in any way they could.  If we ever get to return to Belfast, this will be where we stay.",5,2017,07,26
226,Top Notch Hotel,"My husband and I were on a six week holiday and we stayed at 15 hotels and b&bs plus a cruise in Copenhagen, Dubai, Barcelona and finally three weeks in Ireland. Out of the accommodation, four are five stars hotels. The fitzwilliams is the best together with El Palace of Bacelona BUT Fitwilliams price was two and a half times lower than what we paid for El Palace and twice as cheap as Westin in Dublin which was nowhere near the Fitzwilliams.  The hotel has all the usual facilities as you would have expected of a five star hotel plus extras :- mint, ear plugs ( not that you need hem as soundproofing and doors are of the highest quality), playing cards ( never seen in any hotels and we are widely travelled), sewing kits ( which seem to disappear nowadays). In addition, there are heating towel racks which is the only one of the four 5 stars hotel has.  Bottle waters, biscuits etc are promptly replaced not like Westin that not even the shampoos,etc are replaced everyday which greatly annoyed me!  All three five star hotel except the Westin has turn down service but fitzwilliams stand out again with the lovely two boxes of chocolates on our pillows with a personalised message.  I don't expect much from fitzwilliams after a nightmare experience with another four star (at least claimed to be) hotel which charged more just before we came to fitzwilliams, certainly not expecting that it is the best hotel we stayed in our whole trip!  Thank you very much for looking after us.
P.s.  Ate dinner both night in the restaurant of the hotel, extremely high quality food and wine.  Best duck and noodles I ever had and I love duck!

226,T,"This hotel is fantastic , it is located very centrally , the staff are very helpful and friendly , our room was gorgeous with a great view, it was nice and quiet too . The breakfast was delicious . Great cocktails in the bar too ",5,2017,07,25
226,Very good in all aspects,Central and comfortable. Quiet room guaranteed excellent sleep. Staff were helpful and attentive and friendly. Due to the cicumstances  of a late arrival I did not avail of any of the facilities of the hotel apart from the overnight. An early departure meant that I had to forego breakfast. However I would hope to make up for these omissions  on my next visit. ,5,2017,07,25
226,Design led hotel in great location,"Overall I was very impressed by the hotel and its design and attention to detail but there were a few things that could be improved such as space in the bathroom to put toiletries etc, more comfortable sofa in the room and better selection at breakfast.
Otherwise all the facilities were great, the staff very welcoming and the location perfect for the city centre and onwards travel.",4,2017,07,25
226,A wonderful visit ....,"We arrived for a 3 night stay on 21 July 17.  Firstly, delighted to find that the airport shuttle dropped at the Europa centre, literally a minutes' walk from the hotel.  The hotel befitted it's 5* status in all departments but pleasingly, the staff were friendly and as chatty as you wished  and not in the least servile.  We had booked tours to Giant's Causeway which was amazing and the Titanic centre which we would also recommend.  A welcome change from european city breaks as no passport control was required and at both arrival and departure, we were out of the airport in 10 minutes with hand luggage.  Try Belfast and definitely The Fitzwilliam... you won't be disappointed",5,2017,07,25
226,Good all rounder,"Great value. New rooms furnished to a good specification. Very comfortable and spacious. Service was warm and friendly. 
Breakfast was nice - table service for hot food. 
Robes and slippers. Nice carpeted cosy room. 
Only a couple of areas I would improve:
 - pancakes came with golden syrup not maple despite the advertising. Maybe it was a one off... it was thick and had the sickly taste f golden. It was still nice but just not what I expected. 
 - had a ¬£5 tray charge for a ¬£6 wine. Ouch. They removed it in the morning when I challenged. 
 - small towels. ",5,2017,07,25
226,One Night in Belfast,"A great room, very stylish.  Music playing when arriving, very nice.  Bath design was very nicely upgraded (needed better lighting).
Bed and room was very comfortable (very odd stirage of the coffee/tea making items, this needed reorganizing).  ",5,2017,07,24
226,Disappointed our stay,"In comparison to the previous stay we had we were disappointed. The room I booked was not the room I got. The room previous was twice the size, annoying considering it was booked over a month in advance for my partners birthday.  Service from restaurant staff were not polite, one was rude in fact. ",3,2017,07,24
226,five star heaven,"our stay at the Fitzwilliam Hotel was a wonderful experience and I would highly recommend it to anyone wanting a  super evening of peace and  a little bit of heaven. Our room was perfect and the service was faultless, The amenities were great and it was very close to all the entertainment we could ask for, but we preferred to stay within the hotel 
Thank you, we will be back soon for another piece of heaven...xxx",5,2017,07,24
226,Great Hotel,"This is a great hotel, conveniently situated for getting around Belfast.  Excellent staff, from arriving to departing and everything in between!  Rooms are of a high standard with air conditioning, everything you would expect from a top quality hotel.  Would highly recommend and will definitely be staying there next time I visit Belfast",5,2017,07,24
226,Very nice hotel and great location,"We spent the first 3 nights of our European trip here.  It is a lovely hotel and in a good location.  Quiet and comfortable beds.  So i will just discuss the shortcomings.  First, as most European hotels, there is just a duvet on the bed without a top sheet--fine, I understand that is the standard.  But after our first night, I asked to have housekeeping put a sheet on under the duvet (the duvet is too hot for me).  We came back to the room to find the sheet laying on the bed. So we took off the duvet and put the sheet on ourselves.  We come back to the room the next day and the sheet was gone.  So I called and ask to have a housekeeper put a sheet on the bed.  The housekeeper brought the sheet and was annoyed that I expected her to put it on the bed instead of doing it myself.

The other drawback is that the desk in the room, which held the tv and coffee machine, was so crowded with those and other things, it was hard to put any of your own things on it.  A table in front of the couch (there was plenty of room for one) would be greatly appreciated.

I want to say that we really liked this hotel.  The reception, bar staff and concierge were excellent.  We did not eat there so can't comment on the food.",4,2017,07,23
226,The room let this hotel down,The hotel room was not 5 star standard. The walls were very dirty and it was very small for an executive room costing over ‚Ç¨200 a night. The rest of the hotel was lovely though and the staff were very friendly and helpful. Unfortunately I won't be returning.,3,2017,07,23
226,Lovely and friendly hotel in the heart of the city,"This hotel was a great choice for us.  The concierge/bellman named Stephen (and all the other bellmen, were very gracious and helpful.  Stephen managed to fix a problem for us (of our own making) with one of the tour coach companies.  The location was perfect!  It is just around the corner from the bus center.  We loved it and had a wonderful stay!  Clean and modern room with comfy bed and very nice bathroom.   We highly recommend the hotel.
The only problem for us was that we arrived late and found that there is virtually nowhere to get dinner after 9:30 pm in Belfast.  The hotel did offer a very limited room service menu of paninis. ",5,2017,07,23
226,Very comfortable,"The Fitzwilliam is a lovely hotel in Belfast with very friendly well trained staff. Parking is an issue and if you want valet (17 GBP) you need to book in advance, alternatively you can park just across the road a bit and walk the little bit up the street. We stayed in a twin room that is set up for mobility challenged guests and while it was comfortable it was a little inconvenient not to have a bench in the bathroom for all your stuff. Also I booked this room because it was a twin as I am travelling with my 14 year old son who flat out refuses to share a bed (even a huge king) with his Mum. That said I was disappointed that the twin is yes two beds but they are pushed together so they may as well have been a king. Our room was also an interconnecting one and we could hear everything going on next door. The amenities in the room are nice, the coffee, tea, hot chocolate etc are nice quality and well set out. The amenities folder had a lovely tough with mints and a deck of playing cards. I have to say I was a little baffled how someone in a wheelchair would manage with iron and ironing board and where to plug it in that is easily assessable but that is just little nitty gritty. Our room overlooks the central area of the hotel, down to the service area / car park, so not a great outlook. Overall lovely staff make this a great place and I would highly recommend staying here.",5,2017,07,22
226,Fitzwilliam Hotel Belfast,"The Hotel was the top end of luxury absolute five star throughout. We stayed here for a wedding anniversary and it met every expectation and more. Even had a phone call after a few minutes of entering our room just to ensure everything was perfect for us.
Room amazing and the staff so helpful during our stay. Even the weather was kind to us. All in all a perfect stay, if you want luxury this is the place for you ",5,2017,07,22
226,Excellent hotel in Belfast,We stayed at Fitzwilliam Hotel for 5 days during the conference in Belfast. The hotel is very conveniently located as it is next to Europa Hotel where the coach from Dublin just dropped us off. Also it is near the bus terminal to go to the City airport and other distinations. The hotel itself is beautiful. The room has everything you need. We did not hear any noise from the next door. Breakfast is fantastic too. ,5,2017,07,22
226,Beautiful and luxurious ,"Stayed here with my wife for our anniversary, everything about our stay was  fantastic, the service was first class, the room was luxurious and the bed was the most comfortable I've slept on.
We ate at the restaurant which was not spectacular but couldn't complain.
My only slight issue with the hotel was that I found a open packet of cigarettes under the bed, when I brought it to the attention to the staff they just said they shouldn't be there and there was no smoking in any of the rooms.
Other than that we had an excellent stay and hope to be back again.",5,2017,07,21
226,Great stay in Belfast!,"Had a great stay at the Fitzwilliam perfectly located in the center of Belfast. All the staff was great, friendly and made sure everything was perfect for me all the time.

Had breakfast and diner at the hotel restaurant and it was very good as well.",5,2017,07,20
226,Best hotel in Belfast ,"I adore this hotel. The staff are friendly, while retaining a professional manner. The decor is modern without ""trying  too hard"" the little extras in the bedroom are a nice touch I.e mints, chocolates, water etc.

The bedrooms felt spacious and well cared for! Also the location is great in the heart of the city. Parking is valet ¬£17 , which is didn't think was too bad! ",5,2017,07,19
226,RoxAnne,"Wonderful hotel. My stay was only one night but the hotel is centrally located, had a very comfortable bed and rooms well appointed.The staff was helpful and the restaurant dinner was excellent and service was great.

226,Amazing hotel!! Amazing city!! ,"We stayed at the Fitzwilliam for 2 nights in July - luckily we got gorgeous weather both days we were there!

I'm one of those hotel guests who is a little difficult to 100% satisfy but on this occasion I can honestly say I was blown away by the service and comfort of the Fitzwilliam!

First of all, the staff offered an incredible service, they were all so helpful and extremely friendly - nothing was too much to ask (we were yet to discover that this friendly welcome continued around the city with everybody we met - it's such a friendly nation). 

The hotel itself is beautiful, the decor is very grand but modern, and the bedroom was spacious and comfortable, furnished to a high standard. The bathroom was big and offered more than adequate washing facilities! 

Breakfast was one of the best I've had. The choice was extensive which is always a winner for me and everything was really fresh. I had fresh crispy danish pastry's and a chocolate muffin with a fresh miniature fruit smoothie to start, while I waited for a hot cooked breakfast, and afterwards I had fresh cheese and biscuits but there was also choice of many other things! 

Concierge was extremely helpful, always taking care of our luggage and engaging in lots of personal chatter.

This is definitely one of my favourite hotels of all time and I would love to return!! ",5,2017,07,19
226,Fab stay,We stayed here for the weekend. Location was ideal . Consierge was great giving us a map when we checked in and he also booked some tours for us. Nice friendly staff . Room was an executive one. Which was very large . Bed was very comfortable . Bathroom had separate bath and shower in it. Room was very clean and turn down service with chocolates was very nice.,5,2017,07,19
226,Great break,This hotel was fabulous and well worth the money. A much higher standard than we normally have. It really wasn't any dearer than other hotels infact this hotel came up first as the cheapest. The staff were brilliant and really cheery and helpful. Will definitely go back again,5,2017,07,18
226,Fantastic!,"Staff were friendly, efficient and professional.
Room was modern, comfortable and very clean.
Food was delicious!
Location was excellent, few minutes walk to the centre, across from great pubs and restaurants.
Had a wonderful stay and will definitely return.

Food choice was great.
Welcoming",5,2017,07,18
226,One night in Belfast,"My cousin and I only had one night in Belfast and stayed here at the Fitzwilliam. It was in a wonderful location and the hotel was top notch. We added the breakfast on, which made it easy to get up and go in the morning. Will definitely stay here again on my next trip to Belfast. ",5,2017,07,18
226,One night stay disappointing,"Stayed for one night location was good hotels decor is lovely and the staff are friendly, but service in my opinion is not 5 star, and for this reason I won't stay again as it was our anniversary we missed or meal because I had to wait an hr in the room for a needle and tread as my dress needed to be fixed, there was none in the sewing kit in the toilet so I rang to reception I was waiting a half hr when I rand back down and they said they were on there way so I waited and just moved our restaurant time in the hotel, after an hr of waiting and changing the time of the meal for a second time I went down to reception and asked the girl to get me one she went into a room got me one and handed it to so took a whole  of 60 seconds which frustrated me so much I cancelled the meal and we went else where 
Very disappointed as it ruined it nights plans over a simple thing ",3,2017,07,18
226,Super hotel in a great location,"This hotel is perfectly located.  We arrived on Friday and could literally fall  out of the hotel into the welcoming bars, clubs and restaurants  around.  We stayed here for a birthday treat and would definitely come again.  Staff were very attentive and very sincere in their dealings.",4,2017,07,17
226,The best hotel,This was without doubt one of the best hotels we have stayed at worldwide. The staff couldn't do anymore for you the decor and furnishings were fresh and of a good quality and the food & drink were exceptional. We had no real plans to return to Belfast but the thought of never enjoying this hotel again has changed our mind.,5,2017,07,17
226,Excellent stay at The Fitzwilliam,"We only stayed at The Fitzwilliam for one night but found the hotel excellent, with a good, central location.  The room was as described and all staff we encountered were friendly and extremely helpful.

We didn't eat at the hotel, however other than that we can highly recommend The Fitzwilliam.",4,2017,07,17
226,Perfect,"Perfect, personalised service, with excellent location. Expensive but great value and well worth the extra you might pay. Valet parking, they take your bags from the boot of the car and straight to your room. Absolutely everything about out stay was perfect!",5,2017,07,17
226,Great hotel,The staff were very helpful and friendly especially reception and housekeeping. They also give chocolates and turn down service during the evening. One thing that was a bit odd was all the mirrors but I guess it was part of the decor.,5,2017,07,16
226,One of the best in Belfast for sure.,"Check in was great.  Room was large, modern and clean.  Had everything you would expect from a higher priced property.  Staff were all very nice and helpful whenever we asked for anything.  The hotel also has a great bar!",5,2017,07,15
226,Excellent,"Excellent stay at the hotel. Was originally on 7th floor but i requested to move to a lower floor as the height was a bit much and this was easily done within 5 minutes without hesitation. Staff were all lovely and eager to help in any way, knowing the staff were always there to help put my mind at ease. ",5,2017,07,15
226,"Could be a 10, but a few things missing","Generally, a positive experience.  Good service, good food (breakfast and dinner).  The room was attractive and comfortable but seriously short of places to store clothes and other effects.  The so-called business centre is just a couple of computers, only one of which I could get to work, and a printer.  And virtually nothing in the way of supplies, etc.",4,2017,07,15
226,Warm and Welcoming," The Fitzwilliam hotel was very well appointed.  I always love turn down service with chocolates on the pillow and a snugly duvet. The reception area has a big gas fireplace that is very welcoming.  The concierges (especially ‚ÄúZ‚Äù)  were very helpful, and again, very well informed.  They pointed out good restaurants and pubs, and arranged for taxis.",5,2017,07,14
226,Nice modern hotel,"Stylish lovely lobby with unique furniture items. Very pretty. The rooms are nicely furnished as well with some unique items. The king suite isnt much bigger than a normal room. Just the bathroom is bigger. If you dont like open bathrooms go for a normal room it has a separate bathroom. Really wouldnt recommend the suite unless even small extra spacea matter for you like it does for us because of having a baby. 
My issue with the room was that the duvet cover had a red stain on it from the time we checked in till checking out after 3 nights. Wasnt changed. Otherwise service is quick and good.
Breakfast wasnt too good. 
Would go to this hotel again.
King suite of 811 is right next to the utility room so after 9am you'll be woken up by the sounds from there. ",4,2017,07,14
226,Amazing stay ,"Stayed for 4 nights with my wife in room 609 and everything was perfect cleanliness of room, staff and amenities are all first class. The hotel is central for all the touristy stuff and the staff are really helpful for restaurants and things to see and do would defiantly recommend for a short city break 
",5,2017,07,14
226,Belfast Short Stay,wee booked for a few days in Belfast staying in the Fitzwilliam Hotel must say we highly recommend staying there as its a fantastic hotel and its in a great location. Belfast has great shopping for everyone and has a great selection of bars and eating places.,5,2017,07,14
226,Best hotel in belfast,"We visited this Hotel on the 11th of July for a couple of days and I can't rave about it enough the friendliest of staff, the helpfulness of the concierge was outstanding. The rooms were the best we have ever stayed in and had everything you could have wished for from a hotel room so would just like to say I would highly recommend this hotel and  done to the fitzwilliam.",5,2017,07,13
226,City sleeper,"We stayed  here for one night in a Signature suite, it was nice and spacious with a stand alone bath and a separate double shower and toilet of course lol,our room was on the fifth floor room 520 to the back of the hotel, lovely and quite. We really enjoyed our stay.",5,2017,07,13
226,Restaurant Review,"Had graduation dinner here. The surroundings were relaxed. The staff attentive and polite. The food was also very good. Had prawns for starters, steak for main. Reasonably priced. Had a fantastic night. I don't think there was any music. Loved the dimmed lights as well.",5,2017,07,13
226,Very good hotel with great staff,"My wife and I stayed in the Fitzwilliam Hotel recently for a weekend break.
This hotel is in a great location right in the centre of Belfast. The rooms are large and comfortable and the food was top class. Most impressive was how friendly and helpful the staff were. Breakfast was very good and served to your table. The bar area is well designed with nice comfortable seating areas. I would highly recommend this hotel as a base for sightseeing the city. Also the Hop On Hop Off red tour busses with guides were brilliant. Great way to see all parts of Belfast.",5,2017,07,13
226,Stylish and Comfortable,We had a very enjoyable 3 night stay at this hotel. Everything was beautifully presented and staff were friendly and helpful. Our Superior King room was spacious even with the addition of a roll-away bed for 1 child. Would definitely stay here again if retuning to Belfast.,5,2017,07,12
226,THE BEST BOUTIQUE HOTEL IN BELFAST,"I was organizing the visit of a VIP and his staff in Belfast and even if we were many staying in the hotel with a lot of requests, we felt like we were the only ones in the hotel! The best care was given to us from all departments: The reception, the Concierge, the housekeepers, the room service. I definitely recommend this hotel as being the best in Belfast, from the best suite of the hotel to the standard rooms!",5,2017,07,12
226,Great hotel; great locations; great staff,"The Fitzwilliam Belfast  is a beautiful hotel in a great location close to the train station and a short, straight walk to St George's Market. Room amenities are first rate and even include a tin of delicious mints, two small jars of candies (different on each of our stays) and playing cards. All of the linens are exceptional and beds very comfortable (even the added bed brought in for our granddaughter). Our positive experience began even before we arrived, with the courteous, helpful and prompt answers to our questions via email. Upon arrival we were greeted and welcomed as if we were VIPs. The entire staff throughout our visit were friendly and helpful. The Fitzwilliam attention to staff training is evident in every interaction.",5,2017,07,12
226,Absolutely fantastic,"I really can't say enough good things about this hotel , the rooms are lovely and the service is brilliant the bed is also extremely comfortable, however they really excelled themselves when I stayed there. I was taken ill and they were more than helpful getting an ambulance and rearranging the hotel bookings so we could stay another few nights until I was well enough to travel home. A really fantastic hotel. ",5,2017,07,11
226,Great hotel in a great location,Great hotel in a great location but there were some minor details which could be improved...nothing to prevent a repeat visit. The staff were excellent and rooms were extremely clean.  I would recommend this hotel. ‚ò∫,5,2017,07,11
226,Great City Location,Really comfortable room with a great big comfy bed and liked that they provided tea/coffee making facilities in the room with proper coffee!  Staff were warm and friendly with a really good northern welcome.  Some great restaurants and bars near by and I would highly recommend Belfast for a city break.,5,2017,07,11
226,Best of Belfast,What a wonderful stay and such wonderful hospitality from the staff. Philip helped us immediately upon arrival and also with bookings and recommendations. Great accommodations and friendly staff. The place to stay in Belfast.,5,2017,07,11
226,Expected better from a 5star Hotel,"Overall the stay was nice, but not quality expected from a 5 star hotel. 
The bed cover had a hole in it, the pillows weren't great and no choice of pillow. The lamp shade also had a massive stain on it. 
The housekeeping staff walked into our room even with the do not disturb sign on the door and asked what time we would be leaving the room, then proceeded to wait outside our door until we left even having late 2pm checkout.
Food in the restaurant was nice, but the steak was very tough and chewy.
Breakfast was ok. Not the best I've had. Minimal options in terms of breads and continental options. Full breakfast was nice. Toast wasn't offered.",3,2017,07,11
226,Excellent hotel,"This is an excellent hotel with luxurious rooms, fantastic service and delicious food. I stayed for a business trip and would highly recommend the hotel. The staff are friendly and helpful and even arranged for the kitchen to stay open so that we could have dinner in the bar on our late arrival.",5,2017,07,11
226,Our visit to Belfast...,A nice modern hotel with good staff.  Central location makes it easy to check out the city center and one can walk to just about anyplace you want for dinner.  The bar is great with good selections.  We did not eat there for dinner or lunch but the breakfast service was extensive and very nice.  I would certainly stay at the Fitzwilliam again.,5,2017,07,10
226,Two days in Belfast,"We spent to great days in Belfast in a very nice and good hotel. If coming back to Belfast, we'd choose this hotel again. Location is great and the staff is very friendly. Bathroom is big but could have a bit more space for own belongings",4,2017,07,10
226,Magnificent hotel !!,"Recently stayed in this hotel for my birthday, this hotel really is  a first class hotel , super friendly staff and extremely helpful , rooms are magnificent and the bar restaurant are stunning , .this is not a budget hotel but you get exactly what you pay for , If it's pampering and luxury your looking for then book this hotel , you won't be disappointed ",5,2017,07,10
226,Lovely hotel,Really enjoyed our stay here as said above only problems where when booking was made there was a couple things missing. Door men really helpful with directions to places and if you have never been to the city they are very knowledgable. Room was really nice and lovely to have turn down service. It was also very clean and comfortable I would recommended this hotel to anyone we had a great time for my partners birthday. ,5,2017,07,10
226,Romantic Weekend,Excellent location. Fantastic corner room with great view of the Belfast sky line. Worth the extra money. The size of the room made it very comfortable for 2 nights. Very comfortable bed and the doors opening up the bathroom to the bedroom are a clever us of space. Belfast itself is just a fantastic city for a weekend break. ,4,2017,07,10
226,Nice hotel and good location,"We stayed here during a weekend visit to Belfast. Our executive room was very comfortable with a couch. It was nice to have a place to sit and read other than on the bed. The staff was very helpful and provided good advice re the best way to get to the Titanic museum and was also helpful in arranging a taxi on the spur of the moment. One staff member, who perhaps was new, told us it would be 25 minutes and another staff member who overhead the discussion told him to call another company which upheld did and someone was there almost instantly.",5,2017,07,09
226,Expected alot more!! Very costly parking. Poor service,"I am not one to complain or write reviews, however I am just back from a one night stay with my husband.  All in all I was very disappointed with this hotel. Some good points include the room, comfy bed and very welcoming, however unfortunately for me I felt that the bad certainly outweighed the good. 

We stayed in this hotel for one night which cost ¬£210 for b and b and a 4 course meal for us both. Sounds ok, however the meal was just ok.  When we got the menu nothing really stood out for us. We got a standard enough starter, we then chose our main. Both of us picked a sirloin  with a supplement of ¬£9.95 each. I thought wow this must be good. How wrong was I. It was very fatty, grislly and didn't taste great at all. (Total stay now was ¬£230) Dessert was good. However we waited for 45 mins on our 4th course which was tea or coffee, in the end we gave up and just left. I explained this to a nice guy at the desk and he kindly got the coffee sent to our room.

We also had breakfast the next day, again not the nicest. We had ordered toast with our breakfast and we are still waiting for it.  Service all in all was very poor.  We had coffee and I couldn't drink it as it was horrific, I think it was burnt.  We then checked out and went to the car park which cost us ¬£17!!! For one night! Now the price of our stay was up to ¬£247 !! In my opinion it's very expensive and definitely not a 5 or 5 star hotel.

One thing that is good is probably the location apart from that it has a lot to live up to in terms of food, service and the price that you pay!",2,2017,07,09
226,Look no further the Fitzwilliam is where you need to stay," The Fitzwilliam and her team are amazing!  I'm normally not comfortable when traveling and miss my bed Ect this is the 1st time I was able to  be comfortable and enjoy I stay away from home .  The only thing missing was my Chihuahua Lol .  They anticipate your needs and have everything ready for you and if you have a request they fillet instantly .   It's nice to be made to feel like a princess . ",5,2017,07,09
226,Best Hotel Ever!!!!!!,"I stayed in this hotel for my 21st birthday with my mom to do the Game of Thrones tour. What a wonderful hotel!!!

226,Work outing to Belfast,I found this Hotel to be very welcoming and the standard top quality. I would highly recommend this Hotel. The food and drink and service was excellent. The room was very good and all the staff I dealt with were very polite and professional.,5,2017,07,07
226,5 star hotel,"easy going hotel , friendly and not stuffy or pretentious for a hotel of this calibre. location brilliant and nothing is a problem here. some other hotels in belfast are more stuffy and snobby its a place where you can have abit of fun and laughter and the staff make you feel at home.",5,2017,07,07
226,Excellent boutique hotel.,The most amazing big bed. So comfortable with crisp white sheets. I loved it so much I could have slept for a week. Very friendly and professional service especially from the concierge and doormen. Will definately recommend .,5,2017,07,05
226,Excellent BUT polish required!,"We stayed in a Fitzwilliam suite for two nights (about ¬£400-500 a night - expensive even by Dubai standards). The location is fantastic and adjacent to the Grand Ol Opera House where we caught a production of Giselle.

ROOMS: the suite was magnificent with stand-alone shower and bath. The bed was like a cloud with wonderful linens/pillows and thoughtful housekeeping. The views were average.

SERVICE: also excellent with the gentlemen at concierge being standout from booking restaurants on a busy Saturday night in Belfast to spot-on recommendations for thing-to-do. The ladies at front desk and at breakfast were equally warm, welcoming and efficient.

FOOD: do NOT eat here. Breakfast was an underwhelming affair both in terms of the quality of food (a la carte & buffet) and the selection on offer. There are wonderful little bakeries and cafes nearby at a fraction of the ¬£18 quid charged by the hotel. The food in the bar at dinner was mediocre too. Go out and explore the plethora of excellent restaurants that are making foodies sit up and take note of Northern Island as a foodie destination. DRINKS in the bar  were alright with the Old Fashioneds running a tad too sweet. The mojito was abysmal as well.

Overall, great location and service, dining needs help......a lot of help and for the price per night there is better value in Belfast......next time it'll be the Merchant Hotel with its awesome Jazz Bar!",3,2017,07,05
226,Outstanding ,"Booked a suite here for my partner's Birthday! Service was out of the world, went that extra mile! Check in was smooth and the room was beautiful! Will definitely be back even if we do only live up the road, it's nice to come here and treat yourself! ",5,2017,07,05
226,Nice convenient hotel with helpful concierge staff,"We stayed in the Fitzwilliam for 2 nights for a quick ""city break.""  The room was clean, comfortable, and attractive.  While there were no drawers (and no luggage racks that I saw) there was sufficient space in the closet for a 2-3 day stay.  The location was excellent--right next door to the opera house and easy walking distance of restaurants and bars.  (Ginger Bistro had excellent food and reasonable prices.)  The concierge staff were great.  Everyone at the hotel was very nice and solicitous.  

My main suggestions for improvement would be during their their first major refurb. Both the bar and the restaurant reminded me of being in a Dennys--certainly not the feel of a 5* hotel--more like a 3* US restaurant that specializes in breakfast.  The lighting was harsh and not inviting.  The bar lacked any atmosphere.  The second thing has to do with the bathrooms.  We were in an accessible room (which we didn't need but it was the only thing left when I booked), and while the bathroom was huge, the toilet and sink were crowded into one corner of the room.  The sink was tiny so that when you washed your face, you had water all over the floor.  And the worst was that in this enormous bathroom, there was one tiny shelf for your toiletries.  This is not enough space for a woman's makeup and skin care products, and not what you would expect in a 5* hotel.  Also, the lighting in the bathroom was not great for putting on makeup.  Finally, outlet placement could have been better.  

Regarding restaurant service, the staff are all very nice and eager.  One morning we had to wait a long time for breakfast but the other morning it was served promptly.  The omelette and the fruit were my favorite things at breakfast.

Overall I would recommend the hotel ",4,2017,07,05
226,"Wonderful stay at the Fitzwilliam Hotel, Belfast","Wonderful hotel.  Great bargain!.  Service was excellent in every facet.  Hotel is beautifully appointed, quiet; staff is helpful, courteous, and friendly.  The breakfast delicious, having a large spread of cold items plus offering a cooked-to-order hot breakfast of just about anything that could be had at a restaurant.  Service was efficient, but we were not rushed.  At our check-out, the bellman walked our two large suitcases along with us around to the bus station, at leas a half km away.  If you have the opportunity, you will enjoy your stay at the Fitzwilliam.",5,2017,07,04
226,Fantastic service all round,"Very polite and friendly staff.  Excellent food and ambience. 
Good choice of food and drink in bar and restaurant.  Breakfast absolutely fabulous.   
Would definitely recommend this hotel to any one visiting Belfast on business or leisure. ",5,2017,07,04
226,Weekend in Belfast,"Excellent hotel in a great location for the city shops and restaurants. Hotel staff, especially the Concierge, were very friendly and helpful. Rooms are comfortable and we had a great sleep. We ate in the restaurant on Friday evening and although the food was very good, it was lacking in atmosphere due to the lack of diners, it was almost empty.",5,2017,07,03
226,Fabulous stay,A wonderful hotel. Location and the room was excellent. It is in the middle of the city but very quiet. The staff are very friendly and helpful.  We will definitely stay again. It was one of the nicest hotels I have stayed in.,5,2017,07,03
226,A central Hotel in Belfast,"Nicely situated in the centre of Belfast. Excellent Hotel with the exception of Breakfast which was slow on both days we stayed there. The room was comfortable but the air conditioning a bit noisy. The quality of the furnishings and design was excellent with the exception of the bathroom shelf and position of power sockets,",5,2017,07,03
226,Perfect stay,"We had a fantastic stay at The Fitzwilliam Hotel. Our room was fantastic; clean, spacious with everything you need to hand.

226,"Hotel is perfect, however the car parking is excessive.","The hotel is perfect. Staff are lovely and the rooms are fantastic. The bathroom is brilliant too, with the shower being very big and the bath is comfortable too.
The only complaint is that the car parking is excessive.",5,2017,07,02
226,Very Much Deserves Its Rating as One of the Top 5 in Belfast!,"Wonderful hotel centrally located.  Great rooms -- we were in 518 with a nice cantilevered window looking out.  Tasty breakfast included with hot and cold meals, great cappuccino and we requested and received well made poached eggs.  Nice welcoming lobby with at least one NYT and Financial Times available and fire in fireplace.  Good turndown service in the rooms.  Concierge very helpful with guide for murals tour and cabs.  As I said, centrally located with short walk to Victoria Station Mall, Crown Liquor Saloon (good lunch!)  and the Grand Opera House is next door.  Short walk to St. Georges Market and City Hall.  Room has Sonor music machine as well as DVD player and a nice rain shower.  Limited shelf space in bathroom, but plush robes for both of us!  Fresh bottles of water comped each day.  Very good wifi.   Fitness Center is minor draw back... small and not well equipped. All in all, a terrific stay in Belfast .  If I remember correctly, the cab ride was six or seven pounds from the train station.  (Note:  it doesn't seem that cab drivers take Euros, so try to have Pounds when you leave the train station.)",5,2017,07,01
226,excellent stay at Fitzwilliam,"Good central hotel, very friendly  staff. During our very short stay ( two nights) we found everything to our liking , although our bar meal on Wednesday night was only ok rather than excellent. Apart from that all good. ",5,2017,07,01
226,Excellent in Belfast,"This hotel had everything we could ask for from checking in to checking out. Nice big room and a comfortable bed. Friendly, welcoming and efficiant staff made us feel at home. 
Breakfast room was nice, food and service very good. We will come back.",5,2017,07,01
226,Just a great hotel - stay there if you can,"My only regret about my stay at The Fitzwilliam was that it was only for one night. What a lovely hotel, and right in the heart of Belfast, across the road from the legendary The Crown Bar.

The hotel staff are all polite, friendly and helpful: I used the concierge to order a taxi, and had a drink in the bar with a colleague, both experiences providing evidence of this.

The room I had was spacious, comfortable and quiet, with a large bed and a lovely walk-in shower (two of my personal key criteria when assessing a room). Free wifi, USB charging sockets next to the bed, and two bottles of (free) water all added to the experience.

Breakfast provided a wonderful range of options that I think would satisfy almost any guest from anywhere in the world.

The hotel's prices are what you'd expect from a city centre location in a major European city, so a little pricey for Belfast, but certainly value for money in terms of the hotel's comfort, services and location.",5,2017,07,01
226,Highly Recommended Hotel,"After a arriving a day late due to two cancellations of aeroplanes it was a delight to get to this wonderful hotel and made to feel very special.

226,Close to Town,"Close to down town and buses. Very, very nice hotel. Was there on a business rate. Extremely good deal. Has a small workout room, which is clean, but only one treadmill. Otherwise, everything was perfect.",5,2017,06,28
226,Weekend in Belfast,"This hotel is ideally situated in the centre of Belfast.  Check in was very efficient.  All concierge staff were very helpful and friendly.  Breakfast experience leaves a lot to be desired, service if very slow and doesn't deliver what you ordered!  Rooms are very clean and comfortable.  ",3,2017,06,28
226,Overnight stay in Belfast,"I would recommend anyone busting belfast and looking for an exceptionally well staffed facility to stay at the Fairmont. We were greeted by the door man with a wonderful smile asking if we had a pleasant trip this morning. He then brought our bags into reception and introduced us to the lady at the check in who was equally charming. She asked if we needed any reservations booked for that night or the next day and obviously said she hoped we enjoyed our stay. 
The room was very well laid out, clean and comfortable. Washroom was spacious and well lit. I had a wonderful sleep and would most definitely go back again. My partner ",5,2017,06,28

226,Wonderful hotel,Lovely hotel with great staff and facilities conveniently located.  The room was luxurious and very comfortable with some lovely touches.  I had room service and breakfast and the quality of the food was great.  I definitely recommend checking this hotel out if you are staying in Belfast.,5,2017,06,28
226,First time Belfast,"The Fitzwilliam Hotel is a great location?  Short walk to The famous, The Crown Liquor and Saloon..   Next to Grand Opera House and very close to bus stop.    The room was very clean and nice. Comfy room and bed.  Nice city view.  Nice hotel bar. The concierge was very helpful in planning a Trouble Tour.  Short walk, Check out Robinsons Bars Pool Loft'- From just 5 Pounds Sterling get a Burger, a game of bollards. And a pint of Beer 12 to 7pm Monday thru Thursday!  Everyone in the staff was friendly and nice",5,2017,06,28
226,Perfect,"A real classy hotel, without being in any way pretentious. We also managed to get a price which was very similar to lesser hotels nearby. Big thumbs up to the concierge, but to be honest he was typical of all the staff we spoke to.",5,2017,06,25
226,Warm and friendly welcome!,"Very pleased with this hotel the staff go out of their way to help you and are so polite ! I asked for a quiet room which we got and I didn't hear a thing ( I'm a light sleeper ! ) lovely clean fresh room, nice toiletries and big bathroom with shower, very happy. The price was good I booked a summer package free cocktail and breakfast excellent value. Breakfast room was great lots of Choice hot and cold food. We stayed for one night but wish we had stayed longer, we visited the titantic museum which was a lovely walk from our hotel took us about 30 mins strolling . Also the airport was a 15 min taxi ride ( George best airport) Belfast itself is a very interesting city  we went into the cathedral quarter in the evening for drinks , nice walk there , music and atmosphere was wonderful. We are visiting Belfast again because it fascinated us both and will stay at the Fitzwilliam hotel mainly due to its warm welcome and wonderful facilities.",5,2017,06,25
226,"Lovely hotel, great location","We stayed at the Fitzwilliam for 3 nights in an Executive room.  The room was very well appointed with all the usual amenities and a few more besides.  Tea and coffee were there but also a cafetiere with ground coffee and a good selection of teas alongside the more regular types.  There was a fully stocked mini-bar that even had a disposable camera!  The bathroom was spacious and, along with the rest of the room, spotlessly clean. There is a turn down service with lovely chocolates left each evening.

We had breakfast in our room on the first morning and it was good although a few items were missing but replaced after we rang room service.  Breakfast in the restaurant the other days was very good and the homemade granola was especially tasty.  The cooked breakfast was made to order so lovely and fresh and the service was very quick and friendly.

We ate in the restaurant one evening, the highlight for me being the Supreme of chicken - perfectly succulent, delicious crispy skin and excellent accompaniments.  

The staff were all very friendly and helpful and the concierge happily arranged taxis as needed and booked tickets for the sightseeing tour of the city (well worth doing).

All in all, a lovely hotel and we will definitely return.",4,2017,06,24
226,Great experience for our first time in Belfast,"I stayed here for three nights, with my husband and student daughters for a short post exam break. The location of the hotel is perfect, close to the city centre sights and transport. Our rooms were just as described, very comfortable and clean with all the little extras you would expect from a hotel of this standard. All the staff were very friendly and helpful, particularly the concierge who supplied bus tickets, directions and tips. Our room on the sixth floor was quiet even though we were opposite the lifts, although there was a degree of traffic noise unavoidable in a city centre location. The only downside was that our room smelt of stale smoke even though all rooms are no smoking, hardly the hotels fault. We didn't eat breakfast at the hotel as it is quite pricey, but there are so many places within a few minutes walk it was easy to find alternatives. We did have dinner in the bar where the food was good and the atmosphere relaxed.",5,2017,06,23
226,Holiday,"Great location, staff very helpful especially concierge , bar and food great not happy with the mini bar move it and pay so can not use fridge like you can in Australia. Breakfast ok to have to order but they do Not clear the table even if they bring a coffee they do not take away the  dirty plates till you are leaving. Staff need to be trained and maybe not need as many. Very inefficient but all in all loved our stay and would stay there again. 4 out of 5.",4,2017,06,22
226,Beautiful Hotel with Excellent Services,"We travel in Ireland and the North every summer with university students and have stayed in most of Belfast's nicer hotels over the years. The Fitzwilliam really stood out for its beautiful decor, calming color scheme, and especially the staff. We were only there for one night but had arranged to use a meeting room as soon as we got there. We do this everywhere to hold classes and usually there's some kind of mix-up or delay. When we walked into the Fitzwilliam there were envelopes with keys for everyone in the group and the meeting room was all set. We didn't ask for catering but there were apples and tims of mints as well as water and everything was lovely.I HIGHLY recommend this hotel.",5,2017,06,22
226,Great staff but just lacks the luxurious feel of 5*,"This city centre 5* hotel is modern and well
Placed for the opera house, bus and train station, city hall and bars & restaurants.

It's cocktail bar was busy, with a combination of older American tourists and a few other residents but didn't appear to draw locals. 

Only had breakfast in the restaurant and it was ok but nothing special. 

Rooms were comfortable with powerful walk in shower and bath, toiletries smelt musky and masculine so I would advise you to take your own. Tea and coffee making pretty inaccessible on a low shelf in a cupboard next to the bed on a heavy tray.

Tip, ask for a room on a high floor as on floor 3 the constant sound of sirens whizzing past is frustrating.

The best thing about this hotel
Is the friendly, always willing to help staff.

Oddly also had strange dusting of powder over our clothes left on the velvet settee",4,2017,06,21
226,great hotel,upgrade to a suite!! always goes down well.......fantastic hotel and great service. only slight failing was breakfast when I asked for scrambled eggs on toast and just got the eggs on their own.  I had to chase for toast which only arrived when the eggs were going cold...but this was a minor flaw in an otherwise great hotel,5,2017,06,21
226,Scottish Business Guest,"Great location , lovely spacious room . Friendly and helpful staff but don't leave breakfast too late if in a hurry , very slow service. Room was comfortable but the facilities badly placed e.g. Sockets , mirror and TV so slightly inconvenient.",4,2017,06,21
226,Great location and comfortable rooms.,"This was our first trip to Ireland and after traveling around both the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland staying at B&B's (which were lovely), we enjoyed our two nights at the Fitzwilliams.  The accomodations were comfortable and modern and the turn down service was a nice touch.  Also, the location was great for seeing the city along with many good restaurants nearby.",5,2017,06,20
226,Wow!,Perfect location foto celebrate my birthday with my partner.  The room had all the luxury I could ask for except maybe bubble bath for the bath.  Great attention to details. Very clean. Great location very close to everything we wanted to do.  Friendly staff. Highly recommended. ,5,2017,06,19
226,"Magnificent Hotel, great experience.","Magnificent Hotel, great experience. Classy King room, better than expected. Had Macaroon teats on arrival, location was perfect, I would recommend the ""date night "" package as you get 4 course meal and breakfast and it was well worth it!",5,2017,06,19
226,Belfast Excellent Stay,We were very pleased with the quality of the room and the service by all team members we interacted with. Booked with UAL points and the entire process was seamless and accurate. Perfect location a few steps from Grand Victoria Train Station and easy access to all of downtown Belfast.,5,2017,06,18
226,Great service especially from the concierge Zi,We had a lot of fun in Belfast made so by our concierge. Zi has all the info on nightlife and restaurants. He also shared his reqs on the best sites to see and ones to avoid. Our tour of the troubled neighborhoods with Michael was an eye opener too. ,5,2017,06,18
226,Pleasantly surprised Belfast great city.,Everything about this hotel is quality. The staff all round are very attentive. The room was very comfortable and had a great pillow menu. The only down side if any I had to queue for the single running machine in the gym. ,5,2017,06,18
226,Excellent stay,Another excellent stay at Fitzwilliam. Convenient location with friendly staff. Relaxed from our arrival until departing. The deluxe suites are great rooms. Nice cocktails at the bar before our night out. Thanks again. ,5,2017,06,18
226,Great hotel in centre of the city.,"This hotel is very well placed for a visit to Belfast city centre. Within walking  distance to great restaurants. The hop on, hop off bus stops outside. Warm welcome, comfortable beds, lovely staff and a great breakfast. I'll definitely stay here again.",5,2017,06,16
226,Wedding night bliss,"We stayed at the fitzwilliam on our wedding night and the staff had put in lovely touches, two flutes of champagne and a bottle of prosseco, along with some sweet treats. The staff were very attentive and congratulated us, a lovely time spent here!",5,2017,06,16
226,Perfect Choice !,"Great little hotel - really sumptuous bed and pillows slept really well !
We had a lovely room, comfy sofa to relax on too. Great aircon and nice bathroom products in a large bathroom - ours had a large walk-in shower and a bath too. Very clean. 
Plenty of coffee and tea bags (all kinds) provided in the room for the kettle . 
Nice strong hairdryer too, and FREE Wifi.  
The  location is ideal - steps away from pubs, restaurants, Starbucks, ,Tesco Express, Tour Company and convenience stores, and 10mins walk to main shops etc. .  
The reception staff Joy and 2 Ashleighs were very helpful and arranged our taxi when needed throughout our stay. 
Will definitely go back and stay again!",5,2017,06,16
226,A classy hotel without being stuffy,"I have just spent 4 days at this hotel.  It is outstanding. The Executive Room I had was second to none. Everything you could possibly want was in the room. In the evening, the bed was turned down and a box of 2 chocolates on my pillow with a card giving the name of the room attendant and a note of tomorrow's weather!  I ate breakfast and dinner each day and it was outstanding. ",5,2017,06,16
226,"Nice, close to everything. ","Staff were great! Rooms were clean and comfortable. 
We stayed for 2 nights. The breakfast could do with a few improvements but I am comparing it to the Fitzwilliam in Dublin, as we were there the day before, their breakfast was great! The meals in the bar were nice and we found it a nice place to sit and relax. ",4,2017,06,15
226,Fabulous mini break,"A wonderful 4 days in Belfast at the fabulous Fitzwilliam hotel,  which id definitely recommend. Great location and full of helpful staff. Bedroom turn down service with chocolates on the pillow was an extra nice touch!   
",5,2017,06,15
226,Would definitely recommend the Fitzwilliam,I recently stayed at the Fitzwilliam for a business trip and I would definitely recommend this hotel if you are ever visiting Belfast. The hotel staff were very attentive and I was fortunate enough to stay in a suite which had fantastic views of the city. Ideal city centre location for both business and pleasure. ,5,2017,06,15
226,Disappointed,"We came here for 3 nights on a recommendation from Royal Irish Tours and expected this to be as nice as the other hotels they had booked us.   Love the shower but no room in the bathroom to leave out our toiletry bags.   The seating is our biggest complaint. The chair is like sitting in a kitchen chair .  So uncomfortable. I asked for a different one, but all the rooms are the same.  The couch was like sitting on a wooden bench.     Bed is very comfortable,  but you can't lie in bed the whole time.   I appreciated the kettle and tea pot very much in the room.   The tea served a breakfast was not good.   And the breakfast itself was good but really missed having some kind of hashbrown or fried potatoes.  And I wouldn't have cared about the breakfast so much except we stayed for 3 days.   I read too many bad reviews on their Dinner so we never ate dinner here.  Staff is very helpful and friendly.   ",3,2017,06,14
226,Fantastics Hotel!,"This hotel was perfect.  Large rooms, comfortable bed, outstanding service.  The best hotel of the seven we visited in Ireland.  The breakfast was exceptional.  The wi-fi was strong with fast service.  This was a highlight of our stay.  Fantastic choicd",5,2017,06,14
226,Everything as it should be,"Its unusual even in good hotels for everything just to be there in the room
Plenty of toiletries, tea coffee etc 

Funky cool design with an open window into the bathroom

Has a corner room which was nice (though annoying there were net curtains to obscure the great view) 

Turn down service was v good

Breakfast nice and simple though I hadn't realised it wasn't included  

Overall, cool, understated yet opulent and very well located. Staff helpful and friendly 
",5,2017,06,14
226,Pick of the crop in Belfast,"This property is in an excellent position in the city and the facilities are top class.  Dean in the restaurant was a great server and Phillip and Declan on the concierge desk were very helpful, especially Phillip.  Highly recommended to all.  Great value for money.",5,2017,06,14
226,Tired!,"The location of the hotel was fine.  The lobby is tired looking and very unattractive.  The room was tiny as was the bathroom and although there was a shower, it was ridiculously small and hard to get in and out of.  The decor is garrish and the rooms were very dark and depressing.  What I minded the most was the overzealous concierge booked us a ""tour"" when we asked for a black cab tour.  We were gone for a couple of hours and saw nothing.  We went to see the murals.  The guide talked a lot in the car.  He stood us in the pouring rain to talk about the ""wall"" dividing the Protestants and the Catholics.  When we asked about whether to see the Titanic Museum, he drove us by and let us walk around for 5 minutes.  That was all we saw of Belfast as we only had one afternoon.  We would have been far better off on a hop on bus and it would have been way cheaper.  The hotel and the tour experience made me hate Belfast. The hotel should not have pushed the guide and when we complained they should have refunded our money.  Total rip off.",2,2017,06,13
226,Nice!,"Enjoyed my stay at the Fitzwilliam.  The front door man helped us to set up the black cab mural tour which was a great experience. The best fish and chips in the restaurant. I'm still thinking about them.  My room was clean and pretty but very small.  It was like staying in New York.  Sadly, the shower was the worst on my 10 day tour.  It was a rain shower that left me feeling slimy and unrinsed.  Luckily there was a hand held shower in the bathtub that was very nice.  Room and bathroom very clean but the shower tracks did have a little yuk on them.  My room was also super quiet..  The bed was really nice.  I slept like a baby.   The location is fabulous for walking.  The bus station is just a few blocks away, the theatre, great restaurants and pubs and The Crown Bar.  I would stay here again and recommend it to friends.",4,2017,06,13
226,Inefficiency personified,"Poor service Inefficiency and blatantly distorting the truth around doing restaurant booking which was not done 
Not turning down beds in both rooms
A general total lack of attention and care to clients needs",2,2017,06,13
226,Top Hotel,"Although I only stayed for one night it was a very comfortable stay, the staff are really friendly and nothing is too much trouble, the hotel is really clean, it's in a great location, I can highly recommend this hotel you will not be disappointed if you stay here, ",5,2017,06,12
226,Simon Ceaker,"Went here for a midweek break. Got a very good price from the hotel for a great room with excellent facilities. The staff were good & the concierge, Philip, a real bonus who was exceptional. Without him our trip would not have been as good. The food at the hotel was ok for breakfast however we had a dreadful dinner which was the only bad thing in 3 days in Belfast. The hotel refunded the cost but it did spoil our stay. However for position staff & facilities you could not do better.",4,2017,06,12
226,Luxury in the heart of the City,First time in the Fitzwilliam and will be going back as soon as possible.  A genuinely luxurious experience with great views of the city and access to so many amenities.

226,Fitzwilliam Hotel - very pleasant experience,"Went for business but my husband did some sightseeing - everything was set up very well - all the staff was very friendly and helpful. Large, well set-up room. Made trip very seamless. Lots of umbrellas for use! ",5,2017,06,12
226,I'll be back,"Overall stay in the Fitzwilliam Hotel was excelent. The only remark I have is that during the breakfast, we needed to wait for our food a little bit longer. Location is perfect for a walk in the city. Damjan",4,2017,06,12

226,"Beautiful, Stylish hotel",Really lovely hotel in a great location. We stayed here for one night and loved every minute of our stay. The room was beautiful and the bed was extremely comfortable. Breakfast the next morning was delicious (although the coffee could be better). ,5,2017,06,12
226,Sophisticated,"Not sure if I'd go as far as calling the hotel 5 stars but because of its location and the nicely appointed room, I'd stay here again. The young staff tries really hard but could stand some further training.",4,2017,06,11
226,Disappointing ,"We went for a family meal & were very disappointed with the service & portion size of our meal.I ordered the quail to start  which cost ¬£10.50
& I had never seen a starter so small for so much money.My wifes pork was very nice & so was my daughters kiddies fish & chips,my cod was nice but very small,I ordered The tiramisu to finish which also was very small & quite dry,our bill came to ¬£86 which included 1 beer & 2 soft drinks.I had to ask for the bill 3 times the staff seemed to be more interested in diners that were staying at the hotel.",3,2017,06,11
226,Great place to stay in Belfast,"The Fitzwilliam Hotel Belfast has a great location in downtown Belfast.  Its staff, especially Philip, was helpful, friendly, knowledgeable and informative.

226,Overnight stay with dinner and bed and breakfast,"Overall experience was excellent. The room was beautiful. The staff where so helpful and courteous, which made our stay so much nicer.
We have stayed in a couple of the hotels in Belfast but our stay in the Fitzwilliam was the best by far.
I would highly recommend it.",5,2017,06,11

226,Central for business,"Stayed just one night and really enjoyed the stay.  Picked a Signature King Room.  It was quiet, comfortable, lots of space, good WiFi.

Nice bathroom with bath and separate shower with lots of hot water.

The only criticism is that the desk is so cluttered with TV, coffee machine, cups, glasses that to do any work means relocating everything onto the floor.",4,2017,06,10
226,"Friendly staff, great rooms, not good food","Concierge very helpful and friendly. Rooms clean and very comfy. Breakfast ok, dinner awful. Cold, undercooked food. We pre-paid bed and breakfast but we were charged for breakfast on departure. Also charged twice for a tour we had prepaid. Check your bill! Beautiful city and surrounding countryside with very friendly people. This hotel let it down a bit  ",3,2017,06,10
226,A truly excellent hotel,"The service throughout our stay was truly phenomenal and uplifting. Afternoon tea and breakfast were just exquisite. Our guest rooms were also fantastic, offering great views, comfortable beds and clean amenities. ",5,2017,06,09
226,A long overdue visit to Belfast,"The hotels location is ideal for seeing the city, next door to the theatre, surrounded by good restaurants, near the hop on hop off city tours, down the road from City Hall (excellent exhibition) and trips to Bushmills Distillery and Giants Causeway organised by hotel.  A clean and friendly city",4,2017,06,09

Breakfast was good a good choice of beverages . We got the special ¬£13 a head  normally ¬£17. Disappointed with the hotel parking at ¬£17 a night. Free news papers and umbrellas was a nice touch. Bed room staff called morning and evening. Near pubs, clubs and shoping. enjoyed our stay",4,2017,06,07
226,Luxury Hotel in the center of the City.,I enjoyed my stay at the Fitzwilliam.  The room was spacious and clean.  The staff attentive and the breakfast plentiful.  My only complaint is one of the waiters during our last breakfast was sick and I watched him blow his nose several times and then handle food.  He also was coughing all over the buffet table as he was replenishing food.  Needless to say we ate sparingly that morning.,4,2017,06,06
226,Hotel is Darke and dreary,"Turns some lights on in the hallways and brighten the colors. the Halls look like a morgue. the thermostats are archaic. Although clean the rooms also are dark. I understand its Belfast , its rainy and cloudy outside doesn't mean it has to be that way inside. ",3,2017,06,06
226,Beautiful hotel  great location.,"This is a beautiful modetn hotel in s historic area of Belfast.   The decor is grandvsltho s little dark.  The concgierge chsps wete lovely,  can't say the same for the reception staff, housekeeping was great too.",4,2017,06,06
226,"Nice, but lacking something.","Overall everything about our stay at The Fitzwilliam Hotel in Belfast was good, but it felt like something was missing. 

It might have been that the 5 star rating heightened my expectations, but for the cost of the night including dinner and breakfast something just felt amiss. 

The lack of pool and spa was disappointing, and brought into question the 5-star rating for me. 

The food in the restaurant for dinner was delicious and we thoroughly enjoyed our 3 course set menu. 

The same room is used for dinner as for breakfast. Breakfast was probably the most disappointing thing about the stay. I love a hotel breakfast and it usually makes up a highlight of a stay for me. ¬£17 each gets you an ok spread of cereal (3 options), yoghurts, fruit, cold meats and some small pastries as well as something off the cooked menu. 

I opted for the smoked salmon benedict off the cooked menu. It felt like half a breakfast arrived as I got one egg, half an english muffin, some smoked salmon and hollandaise. It was tasty but considering it was a ¬£17 breakfast, it felt like half of it was missing. 

Staff were very professional and said and did the right things at all times, but it all felt like it was being delivered from a script, which gave the place a lack of personality and charm. 

I won't be returning to The Fitzwilliam Hotel in Belfast; the cost and 5-star rating set my expectations quite high but the lack of facilities and disappointing breakfast meant that those expectations were not met. We had a nice stay here but not one that would have me booking to return.",3,2017,06,06
226,Best hotel!,Right from when we checked in to leaving for our flight all the staff were attentive and amazing. It was my 21st birthday over the weekend we stayed and that made it just that bit more special by leaving a personalised note with a treat. I could not have wished for a better weekend or a better place to stay! Ooo and the breakfast was delicious a lot to choose from!,5,2017,06,06
226,You get what you pay for,"Lovely hotel in a beautiful and safe city.  The hotel was located near the city center, with plenty of coffee shops and breakfast places (if you don't want to eat in the hotel) nearby. The market across the street, Tescos, offered great fruit.",5,2017,06,06
226,May 31,"Great experience, and fantastic staff! They helped us organize a tour, recommend the right tour to take, and have a good guide in mind. The staff also loaded our bags in our car, which was a nice touch.

The room was excellent, especially the tea set.",5,2017,06,05
226,A great stay in the centre of a great city.,"We spent a weekend at the Fitzwilliam, our first visit to Belfast and one booked by our kids as a wedding anniversary surprise. The hotel looked good in website photos & didn't disappoint in the flesh. We had a very nice room on the 6th floor,  far enough away from the noise of the bar & restaurant, but it was  a pity the view didn't do it justice as we looked out onto a row of tall buildings. The double glazing worked well at keeping out most of the traffic noise, but I would not want a room near the lifts, they were quite loud & would probably be irritating late at night. The service from absolutely everyone was wonderful: cheerful, helpful & extremely friendly, worth visiting just to be made to feel so special. The concierge helped to book tours & also a hire car, nothing was too much trouble. Staff in the restaurant were lovely, and surprised us with some champagne with which to celebrate our anniversary. They also left a personal message in our room congratulating us, not something you get very often nowadays!",4,2017,06,05
226,The Best service in Belfast,"Excellent overall all can not find anything bad to say all good looking forward to my next visit .
The hotel was very full however the staff managed to give attention to every detail and every guest.
I highly recommend the afternoon tea we ate n the bar however I saw it being served in the Lobby . ",5,2017,06,05
226,"Very comfortable, excellent location","Located centrally, a couple of minutes walk to City Hall. Very comfortable bed and nice spacious room. Breakfast was generous and delicious with lots of choice and a large selection of fruit and cereals to start",5,2017,06,04
226,A thoroughly enjoyable stay,"We stayed at the Fitzwilliam for three nights in March when we met up with friends. It's well appointed, comfortable and breakfast is so good you tend to linger for longer than you ought to. The most memorable part of the stay was the wonderful staff. Without exception, they were extremely friendly and helpful. The concierges in particular were so enthusiastic about the hotel and about promoting the city you would think they had shares in it! We can't recommend it highly enough and since our visit we have met other people who have also stayed at the Fitzwilliam and feel exactly the same way.",5,2017,06,03
226,Lovely stay at the Fitzwilliam,"My wife took me to Belfast to stay at the Fitzwilliam for my birthday.  It is a lovely hotel right in the middle of the city.  Our room was quite nice, reasonably spacious. This is a 5 star hotel and as there is no general consistency in stars globally, it is hard to say if this is a genuine 5 star or not.  I have stayed in Israel, the US, Chine, Russia and every part of Europe and the standard differs so much that being a 5 star or whatever is a useless guide.  Funny but there is never any inconstancy on the 5 star price you pay.  That's consistent enough.  Anyhow, back to the Fitzwilliam.  It is a lovely hotel.  The staff are wonderfully helpful.  We had a fabulous guide and all round helper with Phillip.  He was just wonderful and helped us in any way he could.  I fully recommend this lovely hotel.  If there was one thing I'd like to see change and I know it is costly for a hotel, but I'd like to see Sky sports included in the rooms.  I was hoping to see the final of the Irish rugby match but unfortunately had to wait until I got home.  No big deal though.  Just a suggestion.",5,2017,06,03
226,2017  2nd trip to Ireland,Beautiful Hotel.  The lobby was spacious and comfortable.  The front desk staff were so nice and accommodating.  They got refreshments for us while we were settling in.  The rooms were large and comfortable and stocked with anything you needed.  The food was very good and service in the dining room quick and efficient.  This is a place I would definitely recommend to everyone I know.   ,5,2017,06,03
226,great stay,"I stayed for our nights in room 306. Excellent location. I was concerned that the room was right across from the elevators but there was no noise. I was also concerned about the street noise as I am a light sleeper but was never a problem. Very nice room, appreciated the French press and cookies. Bed very comfortable. I agree with other reviewers that not much space for toiletries and it was odd using the hair dryer in front of the desk versus the bathroom but minor issues. Air conditioner was strong and was very appreciated. 

Staff was very good especially the concierges and a special shout out to Fran our waiter for a private dinner held at the hotel. He was excellent in every way and really made our dining experience. (and the food was perfect) Saw him again the next morning for breakfast and still remarkable. I would definitely stay here again.",5,2017,06,02
226,Fitzwilliam Hotel Belfast - 31-May-2017,"Hotel well appointed. Friendly, efficient check-in.

However: small rooms, with twins beds abutting; very poor bathroom desing (e.g., minimal shelf space), and inefficient response to request for b'fast to-go coffee",3,2017,06,02
226,Lovely Hotel,"Called in after a show in the Opera House, a lovely hotel and the bar staff were very friendly. Just had a beer and the atmosphere was very relaxed. Plan on coming back and hopefully stay over.

Would definitely come back again.",5,2017,06,01
226,Great Stay,"We had a great experience staying here and I'd recommend it to anyone traveling! They look out for you, the rooms are spotless and very comfortable! The shower and tub are great. The best part was the staff, they called you by name and looked out for you to ensure you got the best experience!",5,2017,06,01
226,Pre valentines treat,"I loved my stay here in this hotel with my boyfriend. We stayed here in Feb this year and had the most luxurious suite. Fluffy robes, lovely decor and an amazing bathroom. It was such a treat to stay in this establishment and would definitely stay again soon. Close proximity to the city centre which is amazing.

Drawbacks have to include the breakfast, waited for around 50-60mins to order and be served and it wasn't a busy morning. 

And another drawback was the parking ... we had to park elsewhere as the hotels parking was fully booked sadly. ",4,2017,05,30
226,Fun with friends and relations,"Great hotel in a terrific location ideally placed for bars, restaurants, shops and easy access to public transport with Great Victoria Bus and Train Station on your doorstep making travelling to other amenities in Belfast and beyond simple and straightforward.",5,2017,05,30
226,Concert break,"Firstly the Fitzwilliam is in a great location in the city centre you are in walking distance of shops, city hall, markets and many attractions 
The hotel staff are friendly and create create a welcoming atmosphere while the hotel is comfortable and relaxed the freshly cooked breakfast is very good 
The only negatives I can say is that charging on car parking at ¬£17 per night is expensive when you consider cost of accommodation while the bedrooms can be stuffy there was no opening on windows 
But overall a pleasant stay hopefully will return in the future ",4,2017,05,29
226,Glam hotel but food wasn't brilliant ,"Swish hotel.  Good room although no kettle despite a whole load of tea bags etc. Quickly rectified by pleasant staff. Had room service. Asked for a medium rare steak but it arrived pretty well done and accompanied by onion rings in such thick batter I left them.  Chips were the size of. bricks. Not what you expect from a 5 star hotel Could have complained but I was starving!!!  Staff were, in true Irish fashion, very warm and friendly.  ",3,2017,05,28
226,My wife's birthday surprise,We stayed in the hotel for my wife's birthday and it was lovely on arrival when they wished her a happy birthday. The breakfast was excellent aswell. The only fault I would have the corridor to the rooms are very dark,4,2017,05,28
226,Fabulous,"Booked for my boyfriends birthday and it was beautiful! Lovely food, friendly staff and amazing rooms! Had drinks in the bar and food in the restaurant before heading out. Cant wait to have another excuse to come back.
",5,2017,05,26
226,Rugby weekend,This was without doubt the best hotel i have stayed at in Belfast city centre. Staff were friendly and very attentive . The food was good in thwe restaurant and the rooms were excellent. I really enjoyed the experience.,5,2017,05,25
226,"Amazing details, service and great price compared to Dublin","The concierge went way out of his way to make sure we were well taken care of for our private driver and tour to the Northern sections of the country. We were very blessed to get Daniel Greer as our driver and it was nothing short but spectacular. I would ask for him by name if you want to go see the Giant's causeway, Dunluce or other attractions. Best part of our Ireland experience...",5,2017,05,24
226,Very comfortable and very friendly staff,"Stayed here on business and would highly recommend.  Convenient location if you want to step out for a quick bite to eat, small grocery items and other entertainment.  Be aware of the fact that the kitchen closes at 10pm and so you may very well need to step out for food if you get back too late.  The church across the street may treat you to bells renditions of ""how great thou art"" if you're there on a Sunday afternoon.  Don't worry, no sign of any bells during the evening hours.
Hotel service was excellent, the staff extremely friendly and helpful in arranging for transport to the airport.  I would stay here again if I'm in Belfast.",4,2017,05,24
226,Great Visit,"Stayed here for a long weekend in May. Location is great and staff are helpful. We arrived on an early flight into Belfast, dropped off our begs whilst the hotel organised us an early check-in. By 12 noon our room was ready and bags placed in our room. Room was a good size, took a while to figure out the lighting,  which seemed to have infinite combinations. TV limited, but all other facilities were good spec. Would recommend for a City Trip, only negatives are lack of storage in bathroom.  Also, ordered two cocktails at the bar, waited 7-8 mins while they made one and then told us they didn't have the ingredients for the 2nd. So my companion sat with a melting cocktail whilst they made an alternative, which struck me as a bit amateurish for 5*",5,2017,05,23
226,First class experience,"The room was excellent, but by far the best experience were the friendly, helpful, courteous and polite staff. The food and service in the bar was very good.  A very enjoyable stay, which I will be repeating in the future.",5,2017,05,22
226,Stay with dinner and breakfast,Everything was fantastic staff were great and room really comfortable good facilities made to feel very welcome apart from the food at dinner it was a let down! Bland very disappointing expected better quality.,4,2017,05,22
226,Great hotel in a brilliant location,This was my first time in Belfast so decided to stay somewhere fairly central. The Fitzwilliam was perfect! It was right in the Cathedral quarter so there were lots of lovely pubs and restaurants within walking distance. Our room was lovely and the staff were super friendly. Philip on concierge was especially helpful and recommended a couple of great restaurants and tours. When we first arrived and we mentioned it was our first trip to the city he asked if we needed breadcrumbs to find our way back to the hotel. Can't recommend the hotel enough. Already planning my next visit :),5,2017,05,22
226,Pleasant Stay,"Well appointed hotel with good amenities. Hotel staff pleasant and helpful. Restaurant was bright and airy. The breakfast choice was good and the restaurant staff very  attentive although it could have been better value. Location of the hotel was perfect for our purpose, and good choice of restaurants very close to the hotel. Overall this was a very good standard of hotel which I would visit again.",4,2017,05,22
226,Amazing luxurious stay,"We booked this hotel for my parents for their wedding anniversary.  It met all our expectations and more.  
The hotel staff were so friendly and accommodating and were a great assistance to me when organising the meal.  
The meal was absolutely amazing and there was something for everyone.  ",5,2017,05,22
226,Good and bad found.,"Arrival and checking in brilliant, concierge very helpful.  All staff couldn't be more helpful and friendly.  Room was perfect and very quiet, but didn't get the chocolates on the last night which was disappointing.   Location was great, walking distance for most things. The food was lovely at both breakfast and the one evening meal we purchased.  However,  I do feel that the breakfast staff should be shown how to lay a table with everything on there BEFORE the customer is shown to the table.  AND most importantly knives should be on the side plates automatically, do you really expect a guest to spread the butter and jam on their toast with the same knife we have eaten our cooked breakfast with ?  (Assuming you are lucky enough to get both butter and jam on your table without having to ask for it).  Also suggest tea spoons are useful on a saucer with your cup to stir your milk in.  Apart from the lack of knowledge of how to set a breakfast table,  we cannot fault this hotel.",3,2017,05,21
226,Great hotel in a great location in Belfast.,"The Fitzwilliam is rated a 5 star hotel & the service by it's employees is more than 5 stars, particularly Ashleigh and Philip. We had room #319 , a large corner room with a sofa sitting area in a very quiet location. A hot breakfast was included our rate & the food was ample & abundant. We had dinner in the bar 2 evenings & it was staffed by service oriented employees.  It also provided a great people watching area as a combination of hotel guests & locals frequented it. 

Philip, the Concierge, suggested a Black Taxi Tour & my husband was thrilled with it & the information that was imparted.

There is valet car parking which is imperative as the hotel is a city centre location.",5,2017,05,21
226,Fantastic Fitz,"My wife and I stayed at this hotel for 3 nights and thoroughly enjoyed our stay.
We had a studio suite that was very spacious and had a great view. Everything about it was comfortable. The hotel is is centrally located making getting around town easy. All of the staff made us feel recognized and they appreciated our business. We set up a couple of private tours, one was a ""Game of Thrones""/ Giants Causeway tour and the other was a city tour which focused on the issues that have divided the city. Our driver Daniel was extremely informative and fun to be with. Thanks to Philip the concierge for setting everything up.
A great hotel and a great value.",4,2017,05,21
226,Great little bit of Luxury,"Great receptionist very friendly.We had a fab room which I should have asked to change as I had booked a disability room in error which meant no bath and i could have done with a soak after the hours of walking that we did.Problem with the TV remote was fixed within 10mins of speaking to reception. no corridor noise which on a friday night was a miracle. The teapot on the tray was a lovely touch 
Lovely breakfast with fabulous bacon my only complaint was that there was the perfect opportunity to promote more Northern Ireland produce such as Soda Farls etc, but otherwise a great stay",5,2017,05,21
226,Lovely Hotel,"Very close to everything in city. Staff were friendly & helpful. Food lovely. Room was exceptional clean. Car parking was ¬£15 a night, valet parking. They were very quick & friendly getting your car. A nice treat to stay there.",5,2017,05,21
226,Five stars.,"Fantastic stay in one of the corner rooms. 
The room was spacious and comfortable. 
Views over the city were very impressive. 
Room facilities were of a very high standard- toiletries, coffee machine etc.
All staff were friendly and helpful. 
Overall definitely provided a five star experience.",5,2017,05,21
226,Amazing hotel,"Best hotel we've been too- staff cant do enough for u and room amazing bed comfortable and hotel very cosy and comfortable- can't fault anything about this place. Will definitely be backüòä. Also good location  and close to bars etc 
",5,2017,05,20
226,One of the nicest hotel stays I have ever had,"This place was top-notch in all aspects. Be warned though, the restaurant stops serving dinner around 9:30 - but that is true of many places. 

Not a bad thing to say about the entire experience. I would highly recommend this place to anybody coming into Belfast - you won't regret it. ",5,2017,05,20
226,FitzWilliam,"Excellent staff and service. Initial room too small but was upgraded for free once a larger room was available. Lovely lobby and attentive concierge. Not keen on the artwork in bedrooms...but too contemporary and ""busy""",4,2017,05,19
226,Amazing hotel!,This is a beautiful hotel in the center of Belfast.  Convenient to most of the attractions and close to eating and entertainment. The staff was amazing - the only thing we were somewhat disappointed in was when we ate dinner at the restaurant.  The service was very slow and the menu was not very extensive. But overall I would recommend this hotel and stay again.,5,2017,05,18
226,Perfect Stay,"The hotel, bar and breakfast cannot be faulted. Everyone at the resort made us so welcome and the stay was perfect. Jordan, Declan and joey are a credit to the team. My boyfriends birthday was celebrated from the welcome and acknowledgement at checkin to the birthday note left in the room. 
Cocktails were amazing. Bed was amazing. Breakfast was amazing. Will definitely be back.",5,2017,05,18
226,Very Good Hotel,"The hotel is central and well situated for business or pleasure . The staff were exceptionally welcoming , helpful and efficient . The rooms are very good with everything that you need . Highly recommend it . ",5,2017,05,18
226,Post-show Cocktails,Myself and 2 friends visited the bar in the hotel after a show at the theatre next door and it was such a wonderful atmosphere. The staff were lovely and attentive despite how busy it was and the cocktails and whiskey went down a treat! Would certainly recommend.,5,2017,05,17
226,3 night stay,"Great central location, exceptionally attentive and friendly staff. The breakfast was cooked individually - better than a lot of international 5 star buffets.
Room as expected.
Dinner good
All in all highly recommend ",4,2017,05,17
226,Birthday Treat,Surprise treat.  Loved location and dinner was superb.  Drinks bit expensive which prompted us to go elsewhere in city and return at bedtime.  Bit fab hotel....will return with friends in near future if offers on. ,5,2017,05,16
226,Great girls night,"The service and quality of the food was excellent. Room was beautiful and we were delighted to find a welcome note and macaroons upon our arrival, then for turn down chocolates and the room set up lovely. Thank you! ",5,2017,05,15
226,The Fitzwilliam Hotel Belfast,"Really good hotel, nice staff. Food and bar service was very good also, and the location for the city was perfect. 
Hotel room was tidy and a very good size. The style of the hotel was great, and also very well kept. ",5,2017,05,15
226,Beyond expectations,"Beyond the ordinary - clean room, comfortable bed, quiet room, efficient check in - these guys thought of everything. Right down to the matches in the bathroom to light the candles they placed in there, and the truffles and welcome note on arrival.
Only let down was breakfast; it lacked the ""wow"" factor that everything else had.
Still, can't wait to return",5,2017,05,15
226,Great hotel.,"This is a beautiful hotel in a great location. Our room was large and modern. We booked the pre-paid valet which was convenient. There was a spot in front to park, then the valet service took it from there. We did not eat at the hotel so I can not comment on the restaurant. I want to mention the awesome concierge, Zi, in particular. We was really there for us! He helped unload our car, he parked, he showed us to our room and he arranged a fantastic guided tour for us. While we were waiting for our guide, Zi brought us a couple bottles of water. He was so nice and is such an important part of the great experience we had at the Fitzwilliam. Thanks, Zi!",5,2017,05,15
226,Mostly great,"We enjoyed our stay at the Fitzwilliam to a point. There were a few errors that we would not expect in a 5 star hotel. When we arrived we weren't sure where the parking was so we asked at reception and the receptionist advised we just needed to pull up and someone would park the car for us, at no stage did she mention that this was chargeable. The first we knew we were being charged for the parking was when we received the bill (¬£17!). We checked in and were then advised that the lifts weren't working and we would have to climb the 8 flights of stairs to our room. My mother is in her mid 60s and has arthritis so this was a big ask for her. The concierge was a bit rude when telling us the lifts were out of order and he didn't even offer to carry our suitcase up to the room, I had to lug it up to the 8th floor myself. The next morning we got a phone call to tell us our taxi was ready- we hadn't ordered a taxi. My bill was incorrect, we were overcharged for dinner but we sorted that before we left. Just a few things that we would not expect when paying to stay in a 5 star hotel. But I have to say that our dinner in the restaurant was absolutely delicious and the service that went along with it was excellent.  The man working at reception when we were checking out was very helpful when sorting out our bill and he was really friendly. Overall, apart from the concierge who was rude to us over the lift, the staff are some of the friendliest I have ever come across",4,2017,05,15
226,Overnight Stay,I felt very spoilt in a luxurious room in a very friendly and welcoming hotel in Belfast city centre.  The location was convenient to our restaurant and evenings entertainment.  Breakfast times where convenient with a wide range of food to choose from.,5,2017,05,15
226,Great centre hotel,"Excellent hotel, staff very friendly and informative.  Room very comfortable, surroundings were modern and up to date but still with that air of comfort and calmness.  Really relaxing atmosphere. Nothing was too much trouble.",5,2017,05,15
226,Weekend break,"Can't say much just when your staying in Belfast this hotel is certainly 5 star . Staff great , food great , room great, . I would make sure I stay here when visiting Belfast. It is unusual to not have any complaints . Thanks for great stay .",5,2017,05,15
226,top draw city centre hotel,"stayed alone for one night whilst doing a tour of belfast. Room was quite expensive compared to other options but hotel experience was superb. Room (8th floor) was especially quiet for city centre which is a top priority for me as a light sleeper. Staff universally helpful, location perfect. A very good option if you want to be close to everything - highly recommended. Nearly forgot - I'm not a huge cooked breakfast fan but went mad and had one here - possibly the best I've ever had.",4,2017,05,15
226,Definitely recommend..,"Really couldn't fault it.. very central, very clean, super efficient and friendly.  A lot more corporate  and less characterful than I've been used to in recent hotel stays, but nothing wrong with that- that's the image!   

A few very small quibbles: the room is almost constantly being serviced in some way.. again, nothing wrong with that and all is superbly done, but if you do need a snooze between breakfast and dinner, stick the Do Not Disturb on your door, or you'll have the cleaner, the mini bar guys, the turndown service and the chorus line from the Opera House coming knocking( Lovely  pillow chocolates at turndown by the way, so you'd be wise to let them in!).

Breakfast was good but we did need to do that thing so common in nearly all hotels of having to jump up from the table and go in search of staff when wanting  refills or toast. We were also charged for a full breakfast when we only had continental, but this was rectified smoothly and cheerfully at checkout by the very nice reception staff. 

There also could have been a bit more written info in the room.. ie I couldnt find anything to remind me of breakfast times  (always forget when I am  told at checkin!). Also I  had no idea- only just read in a previous review- that there was any form of fitness centre and I'd have liked to use that, so again some more in-room info would have helped there. 

Otherwise, fabulous!",4,2017,05,14
226,Good efficient business hotel,Great location for visit to supplier and despite missing breakfast as I had a call from home 9breakfast looked good and none left on colleagues plates1) it was a very well priced stay for a very comfortable hotel in centre of Belfast.   ,5,2017,05,14
226,The room layout suggests they don't get business travelers,"I could see this being a romantic getaway combined with a performance at the Opera House.   It has lovely public spaces, serves afternoon tea, and a concierge if you need help with reservations.  The rooms have lovely spacious bathrooms (except for a place to keep your stuff), heavy drapery, an impressive selection of freebies, and a heavy duty bathrobe. 

There's a lot to like about this place, but then a lot was inconvenient in the room.  Start with the black decor and black carpeting and black baseboards and no lights until you fumble and discover the lights require putting your room key into a slot. I had a very difficult time getting it light enough to read documents and work at the desk.  There was a trolley in the room holding the kettle and french press on the lower shelf, but the top shelf had an oddly old-fashioned radio that I used to see in hotel rooms, but no more.  I moved the kettle and coffee things to the more convenient top shelf and noticed that there were no outlets within reach for the kettle.

For business travelers, the wifi was topnotch but ... finding outlets was a challenge.  I finally went down to the front desk for an extension cord because the only outlet I could actually find was about 7 feet from the desk. They told me they were behind the desk and sent someone up to the room to move out the impressively heavy desk to expose the outlets.  Apparently they weren't behind the desk, they were behind the television situated catty-cornered on the desk.  Remember how dark the room is?  The outlets are invisible until you turn on the desk lamp which had a burnt out lightbulb that they fixed. Each morning they moved the television back to catty-corner to hide the outlets and prevent their use. 

The desk space was taken up by a huge flat box containing special wells to hold ear plugs, mints, sticky notes, note paper and something else that was empty.  Perhaps it was the remote control from a prior television model.  In order to work, I moved this box off the desk.  Just like the television position and the bathroom layout, they moved my things each morning to put the box back into its position.  I had to leave a note to not touch my things.

Be warned that when you leave the room all the outlets will deactivate because of the wall switch requiring your door key to operate the lights. Yes, sadly the tablet I was charging did not like the sudden termination of power when I left the room. 

The room was strangely cramped despite the price. There was no room to do any sort of exercise.  I had to jam the ironing board into a corner to hold my second suitcase.  There were 2 drawers in the cabinet, but down too low to the floor to comfortably use. 

The fitness center is small but adequate for travelers.  3 machines IIRC, a set of weights and a couple of balls needing a bit of inflation.  

The bathroom had no place to put my cosmetic bag and accouterments. I  moved away all the top notch freebies but each morning they moved my stuff to put their stuff back in place. 

The tub was pristine clean mainly because they also have a separate shower in the room. 

You can't watch TV from the beds or couch. The TV is off to the side. Excellent selection of stations. 

I got chocolate for 2 of the 3 evenings. Not sure why not the third. 

When I checked in, I asked if they had a city map.  The concierge came over with a Belfast booklet and began to ask what I wanted to see.  I said a map of Belfast so I could orient myself.  I noticed that his desk had a pad of maps on it, so I pointed and asked for one.  No, all he would give me was the booklet with a small map in the center.  Had to swipe on from the pad when he wasn't looking.  

This place is also quite close to the Europa Bus Centre where many of the excellent tours start. And you can get a speedy coach to Dublin town center.",4,2017,05,13
226,Overnight business trip,"Convenient central location, within walking distance of restaurants, shops, bars etc. NCP car park just down the road, less than 3 minutes walk.
Staff friendly and efficient, happy to help.
Rooms comfortable and luxurious, bathroom with separate bath and walk in shower.

226,Well appointed hotel,Lovely stay at the Fitzwilliam. Slept well in very comfortable bed. Not too noisy despite central location on busy road. Friendly helpful staff. Didn't use bar or restaurant. Room service very speedy. ,5,2017,05,12
226,Comfortable and good location,"I found the hotel to be generally ok and conveniently located to the town center but I found the rooms to be dark and missing some things; like countertop space around the sink in the bathroom (there is hardly enough space to put a tooth brush) and bigger TVs (they have smallish TVs that are perched on a desk and not hung on the wall).  Also the curtain sheers are hard to manage; they do no open easily which makes it harder to get sufficient light in the room (when not sleeping, of course).  Concierge was helpful but not consistent; one night we had a bad dinner recd.  Bfast buffet is minimal but can order hot food from menu.",3,2017,05,12
226,Not a 5 star hotel,"Rooms are nice, facilities are pretty good but this hotel is lacking. Firstly on a couple of days I had to wait 5 minutes for a lift, and you can't use the stairs. Second, at 21:50 I tried to order room service, and they stopped serving mains! Unbelievable. Very disappointing.",3,2017,05,11
226,Pre Theatre Dinner ,"Reasonably priced 2 course or 3 course pre theatre menu. Food was well presented and very tasty. Beef and pork belly was a little tough. Staff friendly and relaxed decor. 

Drinks slightly over priced. A pint of beer was over ¬£5 and glass of wine ¬£6 -¬£7. ",4,2017,05,10
226,Fabulous hotel - worth the money,"The hotel is stunning. The staff are so friendly and helpful. The concierge gave us lots of local information as we'd never been to Belfast. The room & decor is lovely in the room and throughout the hotel. The room is well equipped. Good radio & sound system, good quality tea & coffee supplies in the room. The turn down service is good, we loved coming back to the room to have chocolates on the pillow. We ate in the restaurant and sampled the  bars cocktail menu! I had mentioned on booking (months in advance) we were staying for my husbands 40th birthday & on arrival in our room we had a lovely personal message and chocolate gift which was a really nice touch. My husband is a Head Chef of a boutique hotel in the U.K. and enjoy visiting hotels (and he is very hard to please..üòâ) and without a doubt this is one of the best we have stayed in. ",5,2017,05,10
226,Friendly and comfortable,"We had a very pleasant stay and nothing to complain about. Location was perfect, the staff friendly and beyond. The room was nice and clean and the chocolate tasted well. Overall a perfect weekend on a perfect hotel.",5,2017,05,10

226,Amazing City Break,"This was my second time staying at the Fitzwilliam Hotel in Belfast and we enjoyed it just as much, if not even more this time around.Perfect central location and in walking distance of attractions, bars, restaurants and shopping centers. Private car parking with valet service makes arrival and departure super easy and smooth. Suite was clean, spacious and like home away from home. Espresso machine in room plenty of toiletries candles to make your stay even more relaxing. Love the bathtub to switch off in. Breakfast was so delicious. All staff we dealt with were so helpful and friendly. I can't wait to return again in the near future.",5,2017,05,09
226,Review,Non functional hotel design. The bathroom is very poorly deigned. No drawer cabinets in the room for clothing. Suit cases have to be placed on he floor. The room comfort is poor. Curtains do not work. No hair driver outlets available for normal use. ,1,2017,05,09
226,Fantastic stay. Deserves the 5 stars and more ,"Had an amazing nights stay at the Fitzwilliam Belfast. The check in was friendly and smooth with Jara and lots of help offered with luggage.
The rooms are amazing. Very well finished with a lovely sofa and fantastic bathroom with lovely products. The candle in the bathroom is a nice touch. We enjoyed a cocktail in the bar and thanks to James for the prosecco for our room. It truly made the stay memorable. We chilled listening to music and had room service dinner which was amazing. We also had a wonderful room service breakfast the next morning. The room is luxurious and to be enjoyed. I loved it and will be back for sure.",5,2017,05,09
226,Beautiful hotel and very friendly staff!,"However, the breakfast wasn't worth the money. Didn't get value for money in this case. Overall a lovely stay and would defiantly go back! They have thought of everything and go the extra mile to make your stay unique and worth it! ",5,2017,05,09
226,Wonderful Hotel,It was my first time in Belfast. The Hotel is much better than it looks on the internet. The staff are very polite. Optimal location and very comfy. The room was very comfortable and sleep was fantastic. However it is slightly over priced. near and around the hotels is a string of fantastic restaurants hence although the hotel is pricey you can get some lovely food at half price around it. There is also a Tesco convenience store and a theatre and Belfast oldest pub right next to it. ,4,2017,05,09
226,Luxurious Stay,"Fantastic hotel in centre of Belfast!  

I had a short stay in Belfast recently.  Booked a package deal online via the Fitzwilliam site.  Great value for money.

From arriving at hotel the hotel experience was exceptional.

226,Our Fitzwilliam Experience,It was our our first trip to NI and were unsure of what to expect. Our travel agent booked the Fitzwilliam for us and has never failed us yet and didn't this time either. We made several changes in our travel plans based on discussions with Fitzwilliam staff which turned out to be as expressed to us and the overall experience much better than expected. could not be more pleased. Take the Causeway and north Coast tour. ,5,2017,05,06
226,My stay at fitzwilliam hotel,Third stay at this hotel .Lovely hotel . Great location .   Service was very good.   Room was well appointed.   Some nice touches in room for guests such as chocolates at turn down serviceWould recommend this hotel to friends and family.,5,2017,05,06
226,Be careful what you purchase,"I would not recommend booking through a third party or you might be stuck in a handicap accessible room with an open shower, a sink to your knees and a low toilet with no lid. After the trash compactor kept us up till midnight they finally agreed to move our room without charging us an upgrade fee. They did try to remediate the situation but it all seemed a little too late since I had already lost sleep. Even before the trash compactor noise I had expressed my dislike for the room they tried to get me to upgrade even though during my booking I was under the impression I was getting a standard room. For over $200 at this hotel I was expecting at least a clean small room with likely not the best view but at least a real shower and usable sink. The pictures of the standard room on third part booking sites are completely different. They will put you wherever. ",3,2017,05,04
226,Great,Amazing service. The hotel was beautiful & the room was perfect. We also had fantastic service during our dinner at the restaurant and the food was great. Will definitely be staying here again in the future.,5,2017,05,03
226,TOP CLASS,"An excellent hotel in a prime location, staff couldn't be more helpful or friendly. Room was spotless and to a very high standard, really cant wait to go back, we wouldn't stay anywhere else. My partner is the fussiest person i know and she hadn't one complaint, works in a hotel herself so knows what to look out for!",5,2017,05,03
226,Loved it,"Me and my boyfriend stayed in a king executive room, the room was lovely with a nice bathroom and a bath, I loved the speaker in the room which you could connect your phone to through Bluetooth. The only problem I had was that the second day we had left the room about 11-4pm and when we arrived back at 4 our room was still not cleaned which was a bit dissapointing but this was rectified about an hour later when housekeeping knocked on our door and asked if the room needed to be serviced. I loved it so much I extended the stay from 1 night to 2 with ease. Would stay again.  ",5,2017,05,03
226,2 Day / 1 Night Belfast Business Trip,"The hotel is very centrally located in the heart of the city and is only a short trip from the George Best City Airport.
The staff are very nice and friendly and the overall quality of the decor is to a high standard.
A little on the costly side for what is offered in terms of the overall offering of the hotel.",4,2017,05,03

226,Brilliant hotel!,"Only stayed overnight with breakfast and dinner included in our deal but was very impressed with not the level of cleanliness overall but with the polite and helpful staff without hovering they seemed to know when they could be of assistance! Absolutely great hotel and I would highly recommend it to anyone visiting Belfast due to the aforementioned and also how central it is to shops, theatre and all the other great tourist attractions in Belfast!",5,2017,05,02

226,Great Location.   Superb Staff,"I stayed here with my family for 2 nights of a holiday weekend in May.  From the moment I booked online, directly with the hotel, the service was great where they were kind enough to arrange an extra kids bed in my executive room.  I arrived after 900pm on a Saturday night after a 20+ hour trip from Mexico and the valet parking was full but they took care of it by parking with the valet of a neighboring hotel.  Very nice. 

The room was great.  However it does need to have more electrical outlets.   It only had one.

On the bathroom, towels and bath products were very good quality but space was very limited for personal toiletry products.   They should find a way to make more space available.  

The breakfast both mornings was fabulous.  We normally never eat dinner at the hotel where we are staying but this time we eat dinner here one night  and it was really good.  

All the staff from the doormen to the reception staff to the restaurant staff were were super friendly and very helpful.  

Would highly recommend the Fitzwilliam if you are planning a stay in Belfast.  ",5,2017,05,01
226,Excellent weekend break,We found all the staff to be helpful and friendly. Very good atmosphere and not overly formal. Well located for sightseeing.  Great cocktails!  We had a great weekend and would thoroughly recommend the hotel. ,4,2017,05,01

226,Fabulous Birthday Treat,"Stayed here three night, what a fabulous hotel, on arrival as it was my birthday treat in our room there was a slate with macaroons and written in chocolate was ""happy birthday"" a nice touch. The staff are all extremely polite and helpful nothing was too much trouble.  I would recommend this hotel 100% loved ever minute of my stay. We had an exec King room which included fabulous king size bed, bathrobes to use during your stay, nice big bathroom with separate bath and shower ( most hotels just have shower over bath) bottled water which is free, music system to use, we had two in our room for some reason, tea/ coffee/ biscuits tray, refrigerator in room with mini bar, it is possible to store few bits on top shelf of fridge if need be otherwise when items are removed it does activate the bar charge but don't worry if this happens as they will remove the charge from your bill if done in error.  We also had a couch in our room which was handy to chill and read or watch tv as usually you have to sit on the bed! concierge team are extremely helpful I phoned them through prior to our stay and booked the giant causeway trip with them which by the way is a must it is a fabulous day and you pick the bus up 2 mins from hotel ( which I think takes the pressure off rushing in the morning) breakfast is fabulous, you order your cooked part of the breakfast so it comes hot and fresh, juice,cereal,breads,cheese,etc are out on tables buffet style.  Didn't eat dinner in this hotel so can't comment on this but everything else was amazing. Special mention to Stephen in concierge team, extremely helpful with everything we asked.  Hotel has lovely bar which serves coffees too, staff very polite - overall really could not fault anything on my trip.",5,2017,04,30
226,Pre show ,"Stopped on chance for a pre show dinner, surroundings and service are top class coupled with a nice atmosphere, only downside would be the slightly restricted choice on the bar menu, portion size not big but probably enough .. would have no problem returning ",4,2017,04,29
226,Belfast Business Trip - April 2017,"Excellent hotel, friendly staff, good food.  A very pleasant and relaxing experience during a busy and hectic business trip.

The hotel is in the middle of the city centre so plenty to do if you're on vacation, with the Titanic museum and docks just a short cab ride away.",5,2017,04,29
226,Excellent stay! ,"Just returned from a great stay at the Fitzwilliam hotel. We were given a complimentary room upgrade as it was our wedding anniversary, this was a nice touch. Front desk and concierge staff were friendly and helpful. Good air conditioning, we usually find rooms too warm, it wasn't overly noisy. The breakfast was first class, loved the cooked to order hot breakfast, fresh with good products used and hot. This was so much nicer than stale and overcooked self serving buffets used by most hotels. There was fresh fruit, bread, cheese and cold meats, croissants and pastries. 
The bed was very comfortable and enormous.  The room was spotless and had everything that we needed. There is a turn down service and macaroons were provided as an anniversary treat, thank you, we loved them! 
Would definitely recommend this hotel, so nice to stay close to home. ",5,2017,04,29
226,Great rooms at a very central location but limited breakfast variety,"We were helped by extremely friendly staff from check in to check out. The concierge helped us park our rental car and helped us get the car at check out, all in all excellent service, in a very central location. It's a beautiful hotel, very stylish and furnishings were of a high quality. We had an executive room and the bathrooms were spacious and well-decorated. Bed was very comfortable and the coffee and tea making facilities were basic but complete. The only slightly negative comment was that we expected for a 5-star hotel to have a more extensive breakfast spread, and it was frankly quite limited (only 2-3 types of bread, limited selection of cold cuts of meat, fruit section limited to berries for yoghurt and some melons). All in all it was a very pleasant stay, we'll come back when we are in Belfast again! ",4,2017,04,28
226,Luxurious Stay with the Friendliest Staff,"I had a wonderful stay at the Fitzwilliam. The staff were always more than happy to help, the room was luxurious and spacious, the breakfast was a nice continental range of food and I really just can't complain at all about anything! Fantastic stay and I'll be returning!",5,2017,04,28
226,"Room luxurious, but","This is a modern hotel, with rooms designed in the fashionable style with lots of dark brown and black-and-white Fret patterns which are not restful. The designer needs to focus on useful things like putting power outlets where you need them (at the desk not in the passageway).

That said, the room was luxuriously appointed with a turndown service, nice towels, a shower room and a bath. I wondered what the pixie nightlight and box of matches in the corner of the bath was for - power cuts? Romantic bath experiences?

There is a computerised mini-bar so don't remove a bottle just to look at it! The tea-making kit was well appointed except for milk. (Too complicated to put fresh milk in a computerised fridge and yes I know I could have picked up the phone and ordered some)

Avoid the restaurant, which I hope to review separately and will only talk about breakfast here. A designer has provided long refectory-style tables with weird pointy chairs or fixed benches in alcoves that are too narrow. Cold food is buffet-style and the fruit was cut into squares immersed in a clear sweet gloup. I could not eat it. Hot food has to be ordered and it cane promptly. I was reminded that one of the many great things about the island of Ireland is the bacon.

Given the luxurious appointment of the room, the price was very fair.",4,2017,04,28
226,Beautiful Belfast,We stayed here for one night in a delux room. We cannot fault this hotel at all. The room was spotless and we were lucky enough to have a room that overlooked the city. The reception staff were very friendly and helpful as were the staff on the concierge. The city itself was lovely with loads to do and easy to get around. I would highly reccommend this hotel to stay in,5,2017,04,27
226,Superb rooms- esp 702,"Stayed at this hotel for a business trip. Fortunate enough to stay in room 702 which was stunning! On the corner so had wall to ceiling windows on 2 sides of the room. 
Open plan bedroom with doors that open up the bathroom. 
Very comfy, stylish and all the amenities! 
Was on the noisy side but they provide ear plugs so all good. 
Breakfast nice and plenty of choice. 
Staff were very helpful and friendly- especially Gerard the consierge. 
Good location- very central",5,2017,04,26
226,Five-star quality,"We took advantage of the 'Date Night' deal available on the Fitzwilliam website which gave us an Executive King room with all the amenities required to have a relaxing stay. The shower was like a rainfall, absolute bliss. The bath was huge and very relaxing, or so my other half said! The bed was very comfy and extremely spacious. One thing you might want to avoid is leaping onto the sofa provided in the room. My assumption was that it was soft and plushy, like the sofas you would see on the DFS advertisements, I can regrettably inform you that it was not. Apart from nearly breaking my tailbone, which was my fault entirely, we ventured down to the restaurant. The food served was out of this world. The soup was thick and hot, the bread was fresh and crispy, the steak was extremely juicy and the desserts were simply decadent. We slept well that night and in the morning, we took advantage of the breakfast service available to us. This was also fantastic!

A truly memorable (first) visit to the Fitzwilliam and it won't be our last!",5,2017,04,26
226,Service not five star,"The Fitzwilliam Hotel may be a five star for leisure visitors, but it is sadly lacking for the business person. Where to start? We were at the Fitzwilliam for a two-day meeting, so with one overnight stay, and had a meeting room on the 9th floor, where there is a business centre - but with no-one manning it. We were told to ring reception when we needed something, but when we did, no-one answered the phone. We weren't given the room key, so one of our party went to reception to collect one - however, the key cutter was broken, so every time we wanted to leave the room, a member of staff had to come up to lock it, and then again when we wanted to re-enter. Coffee that had been ordered at 8.40am never materialised, hence our trip to reception. The promised member of staff never came over to take our order, so I went to the reception desk to order it. And again after 15 minutes to find out where the coffee was. The meeting room had glasses, but no water.  Warm scones with jam and cream at break were very nice, but lunch of sandwiches and soup was extremely average. The room was not refreshed. We were promised more biscuits in the afternoon - something else that never materialised. Simply not good enough for a supposedly five star hotel.
Day 2 - and what a difference the arrival of member of staff Fran made. He obviously really cares about his job and about looking after his guests - so much so that I made a point of finding out his name and thanking him when we left. Fran stayed on the floor, and was on hand to ensure we had everything we needed for our meeting to run smoothly. What a shame that our experience on Day 1 was so poor by comparison.
On another positive note, my bedroom was luxurious and extremely comfortable. The turndown service was much appreciated, as were the chocolates. Breakfast was a continental buffet with hot dishes cooked to order - the pancakes with bacon were a good choice.",3,2017,04,25
226,Fabulous bell staff and awesome bar menu.,"This hotel is in the heart of the city, very convenient to many attractions. At first I though our hotel room would be loud at night due to the bustle of the city on a Friday afternoon/evening. I was so wrong, we slept like babies.  Room service is fast and yummy.  Bell staff is so helpful with absolutely anything you might need.  They gave advice on rental cars, driving routes, fun places to see and hotel accommodations in other cities. These gentlemen were my husbands favorite part of your lovely hotel. Your cocktail bar has a great bar menu and fabulous wait staff. Weekend entertainment was incredible, especially the female singer the night before Easter. ",5,2017,04,25
226,"5 star, great location","Stayed here for 4 nights in Belfast. Superb hotel. Huge room, well appointed, quiet, comfortable. Modern sleek design with great amenities. French press coffee pot in room, frig, robes, slippers, bottled water. Excellent breakfast- my husband ate smoked salmon eggs Benedict every morning, he said it was THAT good!  I opted for the buffet- fresh fruit, juices, bread, rolls, cheese, meats, yogurt, cereal, etc. Terrific location- just blocks from hop on, hop off sightseeing bus. Walking distance to St. George's Market, lots of restaurants, pubs, live music.
Staff was friendly, efficient . Also within walking distance of Europa Bus Center, Great Victoria Train Station for connections to further travel. Definitely 5 star, worth he splurge.",5,2017,04,25
226,Excellent Hotel in centre of Belfast. Close to punblic transport. Everything can be reached on foot,"Nearby public transport. Everything is in walking distance. Very central situated in Belfast. Friendly staff. 
No big hotel with many rooms. Everyday free mineralwater in the room. Good service overall",5,2017,04,24
226,Can't wait to stay again,"Well what can i say, we stay at the hotel to celebrate my husbands 30th birthday. The hotel was great to acknowledge it. The room was facing the main road beside the hotel on the 7th floore, which had a lovely view of the mountains and surrounding buildings.The room was modern, comfortable and big. We enjoyed all that the room had to offer. During the night however i was disturbed afew times, by passing emergency vehicles in the early hours and heard them a lot more than i would have liked.however other than that it was faultless. We both can't wait to stay again",5,2017,04,24

226,30th birthday,Hotel staff polite food if the kitchen staff were to have got it correct it would have been perfect but bar manager rectified the issue. The drinks are just heaven especially the Tintoretto goes down extremely nice not over priced either for the drinks. The room had a nice touch with the HAPPY BIRTHDAY ON SLATE,4,2017,04,23
226,Great hotel and in a great location in city center,"We spent a couple nights here and loved it.  Rooms clean, comfortable, and well appointed.  If driving in simply go to the drop-off area in front of the main door and drive over the curb onto the sidewalk area.  The drop-off point only has room for one car and will likely be occupied.  Very nice breakfast although the male waiter we had the second morning was rather bad.  His ignoring of us bordered on flat out rude.  While waiting for him to simply take our order he just kept cleaning tables abandoned and when asked if we could place an order he was rather put out.  Hopefully he won't be around long and regardless this is a great property for visiting Belfast",5,2017,04,22
226,Excellent Stay,"We stayed here for our honeymoon and drove up from dublin. The only issue i had was right in the beginning which was waiting for an attendant to direct us to were we could park. You absolutely MUST inquire ahead for parking accommodations if you want it on the premises. If not, there is a lot that is about 100 feet past the hotel that has plenty of room for overnight parking. After this, everything was fantastic. We were greeted with  some of the most polite service agents i have had the pleasure of meeting at any hotel. Check in was prompt and easy. Our room was ready when we arrived. Our bags were brought up to the room ahead of us by the staff after helping unload them from the vehicle. our room was immaculate. Large windows granted us an amazing view of the city. The staff in the room gave us a brief history lesson on the surrounding area after asking about it. We were definitely made to feel special during our honeymoon stay as we were brought champagne and received assistance in making reservations around town. ",5,2017,04,22

He carried our bags in with us, told the reception desk our names before we checked in and took our bags up to our room with us whilst telling us whats to see around belfast and telling us of the facilities in the room.  On Check out reception kindly held our car until 1pm instead of 12.  Concierge took our bags and placed them in the car for when we returned to leave.   Unfortunately we can't remember their names, but they we both very nice men, very helpful.

226,Handy base,"The room we had (303) was stylish and well appointed. It was also very quiet-we heard no noise from other guests which is always a bonus in city centre hotels. Rooms were serviced promptly and efficiently including a turndown service and were spotlessly clean. Breakfast was good overall with an extensive buffet selection including smoothies, granola, Bircher muesli, fruits, mackerel, muffins etc. Hot choices included porridge, eggs benedict and kippers. The bacon was especially delicious. The only gripe with breakfast was some mis timings with service e.g. Our hot order arrived whilst we were still eating cereal. Also when I asked for another pot of tea, the tea pot was filled up with the same tea pot rather than bringing a new pot... A bit stingy imo. Overall this hotel is a good base for exploring and is about a 30min walk to the titanic. They also stored our luggage after 12 check out which was appreciated.",4,2017,04,16
226,Great stay,"Ideal location ,friendly staff throughout especially at front desk, Rooms are very spacious and luxurious with a real modern and high quality touch, will most certainly be staying again when visiting Belfast",5,2017,04,16
226,Birthday Surprise!,This was a surprise for my friend for her birthday and the staff were fantastic! Couldn't have asked for better service! Will definitely be back! Every member of staff was amazing and went beyond their duty to help out! ,5,2017,04,16
226,Fitzwilliam excellence,"5 star well deserved - service of staff outstanding - nothing too much trouble - discreet bar and restaurant and rooms so comfy to sleep in - location excellent
Tip: arriving from City Airport then don't get a cab - get the bus it picks up outside terminal and drops off at Europa bus station 2 minutes from fitzwilliam - - about ¬£3.50 return!! Getting a taxi had no benefits really
Stay at the Fitzwilliam and cocktail at The Merchant if that's your dilemma!,",5,2017,04,16
226,Family vacation,The hotel was excellent and the staff could not be more accommodating. Bar Restaurant and room service superb. In a great centralized location.  Rooms were clean and well attended.  Check in and check out effortless. I would recommend this hotel to anyone visiting Belfast ,5,2017,04,15
226,Fantastic hotel,"My boyfriend & I spent 2 nights at the Fitzwilliam hotel. We had an early morning flight, therefore, our room was not ready as check-in was n't until 3pm. Reception were very accommodating and ensured that we got an early check-in after we spent some time out & around Belfast. 

Our room 603 was lovely! Upon arrival there was a card wishing my boyfriend a happy birthday which was a lovely touch. We both work in 5 star hotels yet were both blown away by every aspect of the hotel. The bathroom had a large bath and also a large rainfall shower! The bed was not only massive but also very comfortable as well. Our room was serviced during our stay & ferrero rocher were left on our pillows - this was a lovely touch and also my favourite chocolates! 

We had some drinks at the bar which had very comfortable booths and was pleasant to sit and have a few drinks during the evening. 
Concierge were also a great help & recommended a black cab troubles tour which lasted for 1hr 30mins and was well worth the ¬£35 if you want to know a bit of Belfasts history. 

Our only issue was with parking. We originally opted for valet parking, however, the carpark was full upon arrival. We parked the car in the carpark across the road, however, as we had left it there for such a long period of time it cost us ¬£21 for 1 night. The hotel can sign your parking ticket for a discount but this apparently only applies if you park your car after 5pm and leave before 10am. 

Would definitely come back - thank you!

The hotel is so central to all bars restaurants and shops All in all I'll definitely be back and will recommend this hotel to everyone ,5,2017,04,15

226,A flying visit that we loved!,"Fantastic hotel,  Stayed 2 nights on a very short break for a rugby match.  We ate in both the bar and restaurant, both were excellent.

If we are ever in Belfast again we will stay nowhere else.  ps staff were helpful and really friendly too.  Loved our stay.",5,2017,04,12
226,"Cocktails, oh and more Cocktails","On all our Days out we end up in The Fitzwilliam 
for one very good reason 
The very best Cosmopolitans in N Ireland
Sadly the really glamorous cocktail glasses are no longer (light fingered customers me thinks) but still taste delicious. 
Great drinks, very pleasant surroundings and lovely staff.",5,2017,04,12
226,Lovely hotel,hotel was very clean and comfortable.  If I had to complain about anything it would be the room service food was just okay.  Otherwise a terrific hotel.  highly recommend.  I will revisit the Fitzwilliam if I am ever in the city of Belfast again.,5,2017,04,12

Great location great bar food and very helpful staff nothing was a problem . Will definitely stay here on next trip to Belfast. ,5,2017,04,12
226,Fantastic attention to detail,"This was the first time we stayed at the Fitzwilliam but we have eaten there on many an occasion.  We had a beautiful and very comfortable room but it was the little touches that made it.... Chocolates every day, Iron in the room, bath robe and slippers, larger towels, candles in the bathroom, there was even an umbrella and of course in Belfast it would be highly likely you would need one.  The breakfast was brilliant all freshly cooked and you have to try the wheaten bread.  I could not fault the staff, they were all so helpful and welcoming, all in all it was a fantastic weekend stay.",5,2017,04,11
226,Needs a refresh.,"Staff is great, location is great. Rooms need to be updated. Rooms and hallways are very dark and gloomy.  Food was good in the bar. Restaurant needs more attention to food and service. Lobby was warm and welcoming.",3,2017,04,11
226,"I would come back, but if I pay for a suite I expect it to have been cleaned, I could write my name in the dust","The hotel was beautiful, bar excellent both for cocktails and food.  We booked a suite and it was very well laid out and comfortable, however, perhaps they are not booked than often and had not recently been cleaned, the layer of dust all over the whole room, which is predominantly dark woods etc was awful.  Room service was prompt and breakfast was good, however, on day 1 were missing items, rang for them to be sent up and were sent the wrong things.  Second day I just gave up when we got 1 bowl of cereal and 1 orange juice for a breakfast for 2, its something small but it makes the difference to me and my stay.",4,2017,04,11
226,Fantastic!,Excellent hotel. Will definitely return! Staff were very attentive. The room was amazing!  We appreciated the upgrade. The view from the room was brilliant. All the little extras were very much appreciated. Fabulous hotel. ,5,2017,04,11

226,Lovely hotel,"Great hotel although couple of. Issues .....still waiting on reply!!!
Good location  fantastic luxury suite  great cocktail bar with welcoming staff.
Food in Restraurant was first class  and the young lad that looked after us was most pleasant although a large party of 10 was getting served by 3 other members of staff to the very lively group  of which one lad was swearing profoundly 
Not acceptable or the right ambience for our anniversary meal",4,2017,04,10
226,Fab,"Had a great time, room service,food, and great staff. good friendly place to stay. Great for shops and entertainment. Would  reccommend  a visit to anyone.
Only one remark, the bar stock, or the lack  off.one bottle of beer then none. A small fix",5,2017,04,10
226,Anniversary stay,"We stayed overnight at the Fitzwilliam to celebrate our anniversary. The room was fantastic probably the best we have stayed in outside London. We had dinner in the restaurant, the food and service was first class as was the breakfast the next morning. Would definitely stay here again and would definitely recommend the hotel .",5,2017,04,10

226,Unique Hotel Perfectly Situated in Belfast,"This was a wonderful stay for two nights.  The hotel is visually appealing, the rooms are unique and upscale, the staff members were fantastic.  Bar service was brilliant.  Breakfast, which was included for us, was excellent.  We didn't try the restaurant, but given the location, many great pubs and restaurants were a short walk away.  Everything was clean and tidy.  I would definitely stay here again.  The Titanic Museum and the Nomadic are not to be missed.",5,2017,04,10
226,Weekend in Belfast,"The location is great and the hotel was lovely. Next time I come back to Belfast I will definitely stay here, in fact I wouldn't stay anywhere else!
It was perfect location for exploring the city and there are loads of bars and restaurants on the doorstep. ",5,2017,04,10
226,Could not have been better,"Myself and husband stayed at the Fitzwilliam on Saturday evening for our anniversary and what a great evening we had. We started with a lovely glass of wine in the bar then upstairs for dinner. The restaurant was very lively as their was a hen party present, but this did not take away from our evening.  The American manager recommended a lovely Italian Red wine, and our server was also very pleasant all night. Even the music in the restaurant was a nice surprise for a 5 star hotel. The prawn starter was to die for. Breakfast the next morning was more of the same as the staff could not do enough, and my fry was cooked to perfection. Our room was perfect and harm as well. We will definitely be back...",5,2017,04,10
226,"Fabulous hotel, stylish, comfortable & welcoming",little extras in the room & turndown at night with chocolate on the pillow was a lovely touch. Reception area with fire is so welcoming and interior design of entire hotel is superior. Staff are really nice & friendly. Overall a great experience here,5,2017,04,10
226,Excellent hotel & stay,"Fabulous hotel & highly recommended!
Centrally located within a very short walk to the centre of town. Rooms are very nicely decorated and spotless! the shower is to die for!!!
It was a very short trip so didn't get to use all of the facilities and each time we tried to get into the bar it was busy which is a good sign.
Would definitely stay again",5,2017,04,10
226,Lovely hotel and great staff,"We upgraded our room on arrival as our room was at the rear was next  to lots of air conditioning units and we felt that we would not sleep well.  Glad we upgraded and new room was at front and bigger too.  Very comfy bed and room was also very comfortable.  Bathroom was gorgeous and spotless,  I didn't like shampoos etc, didn't like the smell, had much nicer ones at other hotels.  Staff are so professional and friendly - would recommend.  ",5,2017,04,09
226,Delightful hospitality ,"Thoroughly enjoyed our anniversary evening meal here. The service by Anna and the restaurant team was excellent. Everyone made us welcome, greeted us by name and showed discreet but warm, friendly and professional service throughout. The meal itself was tasty, hot and delightfully presented. The restaurant team and Anna made it an extra special evening. Thank you.",5,2017,04,09
226,Review,"Excellent hotel, brilliant staff. Best location. Spacious rooms, comfortable beds, good sized rooms for 3 of us. The staff went above and beyond to sssist us - helpful, efficient,professional. One of the best hotels.",5,2017,04,09
226,Fabulous ,"We stayed at the Fitzwilliam for one night and it was amazing. The decor is gorgeous, the beds are so cosy, bed linen crisp and brilliant white and the rooms and bathrooms are absolutely spotless.
Our choice was between The Merchant Hotel and The Fitzwilliam as we wanted a 5* hotel but when we visited The Merchant for lunch on our last day we realised we'd made the right decision choosing The Fitz. The Merchant, although grand and posh, is tired and dusty.

Would definitely stay here again!

226,First time in Belfast...enjoyed the Fitzwilliam,"I was on a business trip to Belfast and stayed at the Fitzwilliam.  The group we were meeting with made arrangements for our accommodations and I was really looking forward to it.

I stayed in one of their larger rooms/suites and had a great experience.  The room was spacious and modern - clean as well.  Some of the fixtures and fittings were a bit off (poor quality material and/or construction) and the room was very dark in terms of decor and color scheme, but in the end I enjoyed my visit.

My traveling companions had similar experiences when on the higher floors, but the low floors sounded like they were noisy.  One night, even on the high floor, there was what sounded like a drag race going on outside.  All of us were awakened around 3:00 AM to that noise.  Other than that, the room I had was quiet and I got 2 nights of quality sleep.

I'd definitely try this property again the next time I'm in Belfast.  Overall I was treated well and had a comfortable stay.  No five star rating simply due to the quality of the finishes/workmanship.",4,2017,04,08
226,First trip to Belfast,"Excellent hotel, brilliant service, food - everything.  Nothing was too much trouble, even at 4.30am to get medical support with our little boy (very helpful) and we will definitely go there again with our family.",5,2017,04,08
226,Excellent,I was in Belfast on a business trip and the Fitzwilliam was perfect.  Had  a business meal in the restaurant in the evening and food was fab and service excellent.  Nice and central and friendly staff.  One little comment bedroom was very warm and couldn't open a window or at 11pm work out the aircondition.  But in fairness I didn't ask for help.,5,2017,04,07
226,Wonderful hotel in a lovely city. ,"We have stayed at a number of hotels in Belfast, The Merchant, Ten Square,Benedicts but all round is aaay this was the best for the price we paid. The room was gorgeous, the bed comfortable, and the welcome friendly.  The hotel is in a great central location.  We wouldn't hesitate to come back and have indeed booked another stay in May. ",5,2017,04,06
226,Very Good Hotel,"My wife and I recently stayed at the Fitzwilliam Hotel. It is very well situated downtown close to many sites. Our room was a good size for a UK hotel. We did find the d√©cor dark in the hotel ,from our room to the hallways to the lounge. It reminded me of a W property. That being said the service was very good. It is a nice property to stay at in Belfast.",4,2017,04,06
226,My new stop for business trips,"Have always used the Malmaison and just switched to the Fitzwilliam after I got tired of getting the worst room on our business rate. For less money I can now get an exec room with breakfast and the room standard is excellent. Huge comfy bed, enough tea and coffee to keep me going all day when working in the room, super-helpful concierge service that I have had to call on twice, and a breakfast that fills you up but doesn't leave you feeling guilty. Well worth a look",5,2017,04,06
226,What a Gem,"What a fantastic hotel. From the moment we checked in we were treated like special guests. Real coffee in the rooms, shortbread cookies, soft robes and fluffy towels. The bed was so cozy it was tough to get out of it in the morning. Central to all things Belfast, it was simple to walk to the places we wanted to see. The staff was simply outstanding. If you book a tour of the murals ask for Walter. What a historian! If you want a tour around Northern Ireland ask for Francis. They were simply fantastic. Zi the concierge will take care of all of your needs. This is my new spirit animal hotel!",5,2017,04,05
226,First Time visit to Belfast,This was our first visit to Belfast City and there was no better way to start of a great stay with our visit to the Fitzwilliam Hotel. As soon as we entered the hotel we knew we were in for a treat. Would I stay again I don't think any other hotel in Belfast could live up to it,5,2017,04,04
226,Excellent.,"Room was class. Mints playing cards. Bed was very comfortable. Staff were very friendly and polite. 
Couldn't have done enough for us. Zi was very friendly. Polite and showed me to my room and explained all GHD gadgets. ",5,2017,04,04

226,The Room,"The room I was in had a few broken items. The Peephole glass was cracked and shattered, the button you use to dim the lights was broken. Showers got water everywhere. Good hotel but things they could work on.",4,2017,04,03
226,Great stay,"Excellent hotel and the location is second to none. Would highly recommend it to anyone. Staff friendly and rooms great, breakfast was a little bit limited. Its in the middle of the city and about 5 minutes walk from most things.",5,2017,04,03
226,Super Location,"Overall the hotel was very good, and location excellent for everything. The concierge were excellent in knowledge of the area, what to do and where to eat. Very much recommend the black cab tour, let the concierge sort that. We arrived around 1030 and didn't get in the room till 1500, so book early check in if possible. Definitely recommend the Fitzwilliam.",4,2017,04,03
226,Not family friendly,"The hotel was amazing the guy at the door unfortunately I can't remember his name was the nicest person we met the whole of our stay.
I had to upgrade my room because I was bringing children which cost me more I don't feel this should be necessary you should have a family room allocation most hotels do not charge extra just because you have kids.
",3,2017,04,02
226,March 2017,Nice hotel but bed and linen could have been more luxurious. Dirty glass in the bar unfortunately and the gins were a bit over priced. Bathroom and hotel room very nice however. Good price on Expedia.,3,2017,04,02
226,Lovely hotel,"Stayed here for 3 nights at the end of march celebrating our wedding anniversary. We were told we could upgrade our room for the special occasion at an additional cost of ¬£30. We decided to stick to the original executive room and as we booked far in advance got a great price! Staff were friendly and helpful. As we arrived earlier than check in we left our bags which were taken to our room for our arrival. We were left some macaroons and a happy anniversary message which was a nice touch. Room was lovely, very modern and I loved that there was a separate shower and bath. Candle provided next to the bath and a shower head so you can wash your hair in there too! Hairdryer provided and ironing board. Everything was replenished daily including tea bags and shortbread biscuits. Would stay again but only at the right price.... not sure the hotel offers anything extra in comparison to other hotels for the additional cost! Really enjoyed our stay!",4,2017,04,01
226,Outstanding Hotel in Belfast City Centre,"Stayed 1 night Saturday 25th March whilst on short city break. Hotel is perfectly situated within 2 min walk from the Airport Shuttle Bus Station, next to Opera House and opposite best pub in Belfast - The Crown which is a must visit. Main city attractions all within 10 min walk - St. Georges Market, Victoria Shopping Centre and City Hall which again is a must visit with free 45min guided tours at convenient time slots. Hotel itself very comfortable, staff extremely helpful especially concierge - the most friendly and helpful I ever met. We only stayed 1 night so didn't eat at the Hotel therefore can't comment on food but I'd imagine it would be very good like everything else! Would highly recommend the Fitzwilliam and Belfast for a city break.",5,2017,03,31
226,Very good,"Very good location, comfort and spacious quiet room, great breakfast for the value, elegant decoration, gentle service, new decoration, good bathroom.
Walking distance to city hall and shops and side river walk.",5,2017,03,30
226,visit to belfast to celebrate my husbands 60th birthday and do the titaninic experience,"We have just returned to Wales after visiting Belfast for the first time and staying  at the fitzwilliam hotel for three nights. What a fabulous hotel in such a good location. Special thanks to the staff and especially the concierge, many of them, who were all so helpful. replying to my emails prior to our visit, would love to visit again.",5,2017,03,30
226,EXCEPTIONAL Hotel with Lovely Staff!,"It was by sheer accident I stayed at The Fitzwilliam Hotel, and I'm SO glad I did and that they had availability.  The Hotel Reception staff were all very professional, courteous, friendly and efficient.  I also decided to purchase the Breakfast at check in; this was an excellent meal and Wait Staff were very lovely.   
Oh, but the BEST part was the Concierge service... well,  I simply cannot say enough good of the quality of the Concierge People!  Philip, who was there during my stay, was brilliant-- sheer top notch!!  He helped me a great deal in deciding on places to go.  He was very aware and attentive and extremely helpful in helping with bags, my car, directing me in good places to see, tour, eat and just look about.  Because of the superb Fitzwilliam Hotel concierge services (Phillip), I was able to go on Black Taxi Historic Tour last minute which he had booked for me (I recommend this tour).
The room was absolutely luxurious and bed was so comfortable and even though it was in the city center it was quiet.  They also have very nice coffee in the rooms as well as a stereo system you can hook up an iPod for music.
All in all, really, staying at the Fitz was the highlight of my stay in Belfast.",5,2017,03,29
226,Short but comfortable stay at The Fitzwilliam,"I needed to stay overnight in Belfast on business for one night last week and was able to book a superior room at the Fitzwilliam via my firm's on-line travel agent.  I found the room to be extremely comfortable, and well-furnished in a contemporary style. 

I arrived relatively late in the evening after a long day of travel and meetings, and was checked in by a very efficient and friendly receptionist.  It was quite late, so I didn't want to venture out of the hotel for dinner, so ate in the downstairs bar.  The food was hot, delivered quickly, good quality and service was friendly.  The bar though was very quiet, but had a cool vibe.  I would imagine it would get quite busy on a weekend night.

Breakfast the next day was served in a modern restaurant upstairs.  A wide selection of food on offer, and I ordered a full Irish breakfast, which was served piping hot.  

All in all, an excellent hotel.  I only wish that I had been able to spend more time there in order to enjoy the cool and luxurious surroundings.",5,2017,03,27
226,Advance honeymoon treat,"""While it doesn‚Äôt have all the luxuries you can find from the higher category ‚Äì rooms, it is still a superb choice if you want to stay for a couple of nights. You will definitely enjoy the spacious bed and shower area. The beds are just heavenly and you can even watch your favorite movies on demand or listen to the latest hits. 
Fitzwilliam Hotel Belfast also offers some of the most amazing delicacies. It‚Äôs really a treat having nice rooms and a place to eat just few walks and an elevator ride from your unit. 
The staff of Fitzwilliam Hotel Belfast is to be commended. They really know what they are doing and you could always see them wearing genuine smiles on their faces. It‚Äôs pretty much evident that the atmosphere in the hotel is light and that their staff are passionate about their jobs. Excellent, I must say. """,5,2017,03,27
226,"Lovely hotel, good staff, nice breakfast",Took a group of people here for an evening event including meal in private room and then drinks afterwards in the bar.  The evening was well managed with good staff very aware of us and our needs.  We felt well looked after and the room I stayed in was nicely decorated and very comfortable.  I finished off the stay with an excellent breakfast served by pleasant and very attentive staff.  I would be happy to recommend this hotel for a stay in Belfast and it is in a very central location.,4,2017,03,24
226,Good Hotel few things let it down!,"Stayed here at the wkend with my partner, we were looking forward to staying in a 5 star hotel, we had stayed here once before three years ago and we weren't disappointment we booked a standard room, as thats what we booked last time and it was top class, this time however the room we were given was very small, you couldnt have swung a cat init, so since it was my partners birthday we decided to splash out a little and changed to a Deluxe room that wasnt any hassle at all with the staff, some difference, was an extra 60 pound which i thing was a bit dear but we didnt complain bath in the middle of room mini fridge, bathrobes all the wee bits were class king size bed was so comfy the only down side was the church bells rights beside us on the fourth floor, they off every hour and the next morning when me and my partner were having a nice lie in the bells played a tune which i wasnt happy with at all couldnt get back to sleep i think for the price you pay this isnt acceptable so make sure if your on the fourth floor you ask not to be near the church with the noisy bells other than that top class an we would be back just not to the fourth floor! ",4,2017,03,21
226,Belfast so worth a visit ,"Visited daughter who is studying at QUB.  Belfast is vibrant and happy, with regeneration really having a huge effect. Wonderful shops and restaurants. The Barking Dog is excellent. We went to the  Titanic and that is so brilliant- nobody should leave Belfast without visiting.",5,2017,03,20
226,Excellent Hotel,"The hotel is modern, stylish, and the service is impeccable. The staff were very attentive and eager to help. Check in was swift as was the check out. My room rate included the breakfast which was served in the restaurant on the first floor. It was a decent continental breakfast, but not the best one I have had. You could also order items from the a la carte at no extra charge. 

I stayed in a corner room which meant that two walls were just glass giving a good view at the expense of quite a bit of road noise. This did not bother me but if you are a light sleeper you might be better off asking for a room that does not overlook the intersection. The room was very well appointed and clean with a large and spacious bathroom. 

Overall my stay was very pleasant and I would be happy to stay at the Fitzwilliam again if I find myself in Belfast.",5,2017,03,20
226,Beautiful city centre hotel,"Having used the fitzwilliam for both business and pleasure, I can safely say that it is a pleasure to visit and stay. The staff are wonderful and the rooms have that lovely boutiquey feel. Food in the restaurant is 2nd to none and the cocktails in the bar are exquisite. I continue to use this hotel for myself and for clients and have never had an issue. Highly recommended.",5,2017,03,20
226,Fantastic hotel,"Very very good hotel. Staff are friendly and extremely attentive, rooms are spacious, beds are comfortable, the breakfast is great, room service food is also very good.  

The only issue we had was that it was a little noisey. There is a church over the road and there seemed to be ambulances going past with their sirens on full blast on a regular basis (perhaps there is a hospital or ambulance station nearby). Obviously this is nothing the hotel can do anything about, so I would recommend asking for a room at the back of the hotel to avoid these minor annoyances. 

Being a regular visitor to Belfast for work purposes, I will certainly stay here again and would also fully recommend the hotel to other visitors. ",5,2017,03,20
226,"Great Hotel, room not great!","Stayed Friday to Sunday in March, beautiful hotel the staff are amazing and so friendly, very expensive room 150 a night through e bookers, was expecting more for the money but i thought nice hotel right in the middle of Belfast so that's it was expensive.  A fundamental part of staying away is getting glammed up and going out of a night/day, there was no mirror for hair and make up there was a mirror on the back of the toilet door and on above the bed which had patterns in it but not one on the table?  no socket for hairdryer near a mirror! very disappointed, Had interlocking door to next room and unfortunately for us we had 50 shades next door not pleasant  specially at 1 in the morning! i did complain and i spoke to the manager in the morning who couldn't have been nicer and discounted my bill for the inconvenience.  All in all i would go back but not in that room!!!!!!!!",4,2017,03,20
226,Lovely stay in belfast,"Myself and my partner stayed in the fitzwilliam for three nights over st Patrick's weekend. This is such a beautiful hotel and really made our stay. We stayed in one of the hotels executive rooms, which was lovely - very spacious. What also made the stay very enjoyable was all of the staff - reception, concierge and bar staff were all welcoming and friendly. We visited the bar a few nights, I would recommend the cocktails!! I would definitely recommend this hotel to family and friends, and will stay again the next time we visit belfast. ",5,2017,03,19
226,Lovely Hotel ,"Absolutely fabulous hotel, the decor was beautiful through the hotel and the room itself. Nice little touches in the room e.g. A pleasant display box with the TV remote, mints, ear plugs, pencils, note pad and room service menu. 

The coffee/tea were well presented with a  cafeti√®re included which was well appreciated after St.Patricks day hangover.

The bed is very cosy, bathroom is luxury at its finest with a nice little candle added next to the bath. 

Staff are fantastic with friendly demeanour and are a credit to the hotel. 

Overall we were really happy and will definitely be staying here again ",5,2017,03,18
226,Fabulous!,"Took my husband here for four nights for his 50th birthday. I had told the hotel in advance that it was a special break when I upgraded our room to a delux room. We were not disappointed at all. Chocolates on arrival with a lovely birthday wishes card was a very nice touch and the room was magnificent.  With the room occupying one corner of the hotel with floor to ceiling glass windows, the views looked out over Belfast city and were amazing.  We had 3 wonderful nights before upstairs left their bath on and sent the contents through our ceiling but we were swiftly moved to a superior room with ease and without fuss.  I wasn't as keen on this room so a little bit disappointing but no reflection on the hotel here.  The bus station is in the street next door with a bus going direct from outside the airport so minimum transfer hassle and excursions to the giants causeway going from the same street so absolutely ideal. Hotel staff fabulous, room fabulous, food fabulous...if I was going to be picky we were waiting a while at the restaurant reception before being seen to but nothing major.  Bar staff very nice and helpful. 

This hotel I would absolutely recommend.  A little bit more pricey I admit but well worth every penny.  We are definitely going back, hopefully without any bath water antics this time ‚ò∫Ô∏è.   Oh and the titanic museum is roughly around 15 minutes from hotel and cost around ¬£8. Even the taxi driver was great!  I work in the hotel industry and can be pickier than most so well done to all at the fitzwilliam!  The crown saloon opposite the hotel must be by far the quirkiest pub I have ever visited so make sure to pay a visit.",5,2017,03,15
226,Fantastic,My Girlfriend and I stayed at this hotel last week. The room was amazing and to a extremely high standard. We would regularly stay in Hotels up and down the country/abroad and could not fault this. The bathroom was large and the shower massive!! The room itself was spacious with a minibar and little small extras left for us. The lobby was very modern and the staff very friendly. Can't recommend enough. Top class. ,5,2017,03,14
226,class act,"We stayed in the hotel on Friday the 10th.  Greeted by the door staff and shown to reception, very courteous and friendly.  The reception staff were equally friendly and friendly.  The process of booking in was very smooth and completely professional.  The room was very clean and well laid out with everything required for a lovely stay.  The staff actually made this stay something special and the knowledge of the door men was very helpful.",5,2017,03,14
226,Cocktail Class,We didn't sadly stay here but instead there was 8 of us learning to make cocktails in the bar with Bryan the head cocktail man.  Great few hours and nothing was too much trouble.  Recommend this experience and good value too.,5,2017,03,13
226,Christening in Belfast,"We stayed for the first time at the Fitzwilliam in Belfast for two nights
We were there for my grandsons christening 
It was a really lovely hotel 
The welcoming staff were really helpful as were all the restaurant staff
I was a bit surprised when at dinner my husband (whose Italian) asked for some olive oil for his salad and he was told they didn't have any that said the food was excellent 

Our room was very spacious but upon going into the bathroom I realised why , we were in a disabled room 
Everything was really low down which would be fine in general but I'm just getting over a major spinal fusion so it made things difficult , also , there was a constant banging noise  it went on the whole time , we mentioned it to reception and in fairness to them they did offer to change our rooms but we only had one night left so we decided to stay put 
The member of staff who came to our room said it was very noisy and she was surprised that nobody else had complained 

Overall our stay at the Fitzwilliam was very nice and should we return to Belfast we will stay there again hopefully minus the banging and with higher sinks in our bathroom",4,2017,03,13
226,"Great location, friendly staff","Probably no better location in town. This very clean and comfortable hotel is ideal as a base for the walkers and touring pros as well. You are greeted by friendly staff, whisked through a very efficient check in process and arrive at clean and comfortable rooms.For the business traveler (me) the rooms could be a bit brighter for working but a minor issue. the breakfast buffet provides for ample choices for both the healthy eaters, and the rest of us who wouldn't miss a chance for a full Irish breakfast.",4,2017,03,11
226,A far cry from 5 Star luxury,"A far cry from 5 Star. The reception and concierge were polite and friendly, but not outstanding. Housekeeping was poor, the bedroom window had finger marks smeared across it on check in, the turndown service was very hit and miss, or a little more miss than hit to be true, so much so that on the third day it had to be requested. The rooms cary noise from neighbouring rooms all too readily and when the couple next door chose to party until 3am, a sleepless night was had despite a call to reception asking a staff member to speak with them. Breakfast was the biggest let down, service was slow, staff inattentive, the cooked breakfast acceptable but far from great and for it took three days and numerous requests to have toast which was toasted on both sides of the bread.
Had this been a 4 Star hotel I would have thought it OK/acceptable and do think this is were it should be rated, as a 5 Star hotel there is no trace of luxury, staff are rarely the first to engage, if they do at all. Exceptionally disappointing and highly over rated for the actual product which was delivered. More geared toward business travellers than the higher end of the tourism sector.",3,2017,03,10
226,Has a high opinion of itself.,"Don't get me wrong, this is a nice hotel. The rooms are good and well appointed. The hotel is in a good location I think. The breakfast was adequate. I think the prices are questionable, the standard room was over ¬£200, albeit that the rate I paid was ¬£125. Clearly worth checking for better prices on the internet. On the bright side it has at least been bombed fewer times that The Europa hotel just round the corner",4,2017,03,10
226,Sexy and Unique,"This is one fineeee hotel! It's been my fav forever.. having stayed here around 10 times now in various rooms for various occasions I have never been disappointed!
Where to start..
From the moment you arrive and the concierge takes your car to park and suitcases to the room whilst you speedily check in then head to the bar for cocktails.. Its just delightful! A French 75 in one hand made to my personal taste with my favourite gin substituting the standard one.. and the cocktail menu in the other picking my next cocktail to sample..
The decor is lush- dark lighting is my personal fav! So sexy and unique..
Return to the room to freshen up to see that the turndown service staff have drawn the curtains and laid out the robes and slippers and tucked the corners of the duvet around my rabbit teddy bear ( it's a personal thing but it's one well travelled rabbit)..  it's just fantastic service! All the staff are so friendly and helpful..
The room facilities are perfect.. even better now with the added touches (the cards, earplugs, stationary and mints )

I've stayed here for nights out with friends in town and for my partners 30th which was one to remember.. the management left a chocolate written note wishing him a happy birthday and a personal note which was lovely!
But my fav stays have been the ones where I don't leave the hotel..  my cosy nights in at the fitz!
Can't fault the place.. it's perfect!",5,2017,03,09
226,Perfect,"Stayed here for two nights to celebrate my husbands 30th birthday. Staff were extremely helpful friendly and polite and hotel is beautiful. Rooms immaculate and stylish, bed so comfortable, lobby comfortable and beautiful. Concierge extremely useful for directions and advice and obviously took care of luggage. Mentioned it was a special birthday and special chocolates and message left in room which added a special touch! 
Would recommend without a doubt and hope to visit again üôåüèºü•Çüòç",5,2017,03,09
226,Overnight Anniversary Stay,Another outstanding stay at the Fitz I can't compliment this hotel enough. It is my partner and I must stay hotel for Belfast stays. The staff from reservations to waiters are always helpful and courteous to your needs. I've stayed about 11 times now I've been in most of the room types and they never fail me. We just stayed for the first time in the superior room lovely touches and great bathroom. We normally stay in Studio Suites or the Deluxe rooms but we found this room above standard and the recent renovations of these rooms have helped make it the best 5* hotel in Belfast. The only fault my partner had part of his diet needs is he needs full fat milk or cream. But he asked for this at breakfast and couldn't be accommodated. Other than this 5* service throughout we defo will be back! Thank you Fitz for your amazing attention to detail. ,5,2017,03,09
226,"Excellent hotel, excellent location ","This was our first visit to Belfast but I doubt there are many better hotels.

The hotel has been refurbished recently and is really very well appointed.

The rooms are very well furnished and the beds are very comfortable.

The bath is big and there is a powerful shower.

The staff are very helpful and the concierge was brilliant at bringing our car when required.

It has a very central location close to great bars and shopping.

We would use this hotel again and it is highly recommended.",5,2017,03,09
226,Disgraceful,"Recently stayed in this hotel with high expectations, WRONG IDEA. I had won a competition off a local radio station for a nights stay with breakfast the following morning. Hotel staff called to the door TWICE in the space of 20 minutes about several noise complaints from other residents. Either the walls are wafer thin or the other residents had exceptional hearing as all we were doing was having a few quiet drinks and TALKING in our room. Plus, every room comes with a set of ear plugs in a little container, the fact that they had the nerve to treat a reserved couple like us, PRIZE WINNERS ALSO, in such a way is an absolute disgrace. There are plenty of other hotels around the area that would not cost nearly as much as this place. Also, my partner had a bath the evening that we stayed and the water had still not drained away the following morning says a lot about the plumbing and cleanliness of the place, plus both the bath and the shower are horrendously slippery when wet and all they provide you with is one bath mat, absolutely ridiculous. DO NOT STAY HERE. ",1,2017,03,09
226,Fantastic!,"Absolutely fantastic hotel! Me and my mum stayed here for 3 nights in a twin room and we loved coming back to our room after our day out. Room was cleaned everyday for when we got back after our day out, even replenished the bar of soap etc everyday, and the bed is really comfortable! The room was amazing and i wouldn't stay anywhere else if i decide to return to Belfast!",5,2017,03,08
226,Weekend Break,"The hotel is wonderfully finished and in an excellent location. Hotel is right in the city centre next to the opera house with everything pretty much in walking distance. 

The decor of the hotel is very modern and I personally found rooms and hallways really dark (alot of black). 

Rooms were really clean and pretty spacious. 

Check-In process was smooth with no queues and the staff very helpful and welcoming . I availed of the hotel parking for 17stg per night but found out after there is car park across the road for 11stg per night. 

Hotel a little on the expensive side and im not 100% sure its that's much better than other hotels in the area. All in All i liked it and would recommend it",4,2017,03,06
226,Great hotel and excellent location ,Have just returned from Belfast which we stayed in the Fitzwilliam Hotel. Had an excellent time. As this was our first visit we had did a lot of sightseeing etc. The staff were always polite and helpful with our days out. The room was clean and tidy. We also had our evening meal in the restaurant which was really nice together with a good breakfast. Would also recommend the cocktails in the bar. We would like to thank you all for the lovely stay we had and look forward to returning. ,5,2017,03,05
226,Long weekend,"I stayed at the Fitzwilliam Hotel from the 16-19th Feb 2017.  It was a very enjoyable stay and the concierge (Philip) provided a wonderful service to myself and my partner. He even offered us champagne to celebrate our engagement.

The room was very comfortable and beautiful.  The restaurant food was also incredible and I really enjoyed my stay with them.  I would stay again each time I visit home.

Thank you all for a wonderful stay.",5,2017,03,03
226,"Absolutely fantastic hotel, would definitely recommend if you are staying in Belfast.",Stayed here in February 2017 as we were attending a concert in Belfast and absolutely loved this hotel. The rooms are nice and spacious and beautifully decorated. The bar is lovely and cosy and we ate in the restaurant upstairs and the food was absolutely beautiful. The staff are very friendly and accommodating The package we had included one night b&b and dinner and it was extremely reasonable for the high quality we received. Would absolutely recommend staying here if you are going to Belfast.,5,2017,03,03
226,Winter break,Had a one night stay here. Comfortable room with a big bed which made for a peaceful nights rest. Good breakfast. downside was that it was a little overpriced but wouldn't rule out staying here again for another city break,3,2017,03,01
226,Riogh ,"Amazing hotel. Wonderful staff across every area who were all so welcoming, friendly and helpful. Great food in both the bar and restaurant. The room was one of the best we have stayed in anywhere. The location could not have been better which was right in the centre of everything. Highly recommend this hotel. ",5,2017,02,27
226,Excellent - will return!,"A fantastic hotel ‚Äì would highly recommend.

Brilliant service from the moment you walk in.  Modern, well laid out, and great location.  Our room was really nice, although small, it was modern, clean and well equipped. 

Breakfast was incredibly good with the ability to order off the menu ‚Äì try the omelette!
Cocktails are excellent quality at the hotel bar too.

The gym is a bit of a letdown with only 1 stepper and 1 treadmill, and a couple of lose weights ‚Äì so this is definitely an area to improve.

Otherwise, staff were really friendly and helpful, and we really enjoyed our stay.  We will definitely return.",5,2017,02,26
226,"Love the bell men!, great service, great hotel ","We stayed two nights.  Asked for a quiet room and got one facing the back of the hotel, very quiet!   The bell men/concierge were fantastic, by the time we left they knew our names and our travels.  Great rooms and location.  Face the back of the hotel! ",5,2017,02,26
226,Very nice,"Well situated hotel very clean friendly staff and great location. Everything you'd expect from a quality hotel . Bars , cafes and cinema near hand as well as the opera house practically next door . A must if you are looking for a special night away.",5,2017,02,26
226,Pre theatre treat,We visited the restaurant for the ore theatre special which was great value. Food was great as was the service. One minor complaint was the hake was served in a bowl which made it awkward to eat. If you are going to the Opera house this is next door!,5,2017,02,26
226,excellent hotel in a perfect location,"Absolutely loved my stay at this hotel! Very reasonably priced. Bedrooms were amazing (loved the decor), the staff were very welcoming and friendly and the fried breakfast was delicious.  I would definitely recommend hotel to others",5,2017,02,25
226,Short break in Belfast,"We loved this hotel. The room, the location, the staff were all superb.  Our room was near the lift and we were worried that it would be noisy, but we found it really quite. We flew into Belfast international airport, and got rhe 300 bus into Belfast. This was really easy, and the fitzwilliam was a 5 minute walk from the bus station. We had organised a day trip to the giants causeway which we purchased on groupon. A really good day out, with fantastic scenery. The second day we took the bus tour and spent a few hours exploring the titanic museum. We were then lucky enough to get tickets for The Buddy Holly show at the Opera House next door. A fantastic few days at the Fitzwilliam",5,2017,02,23
226,Amazing hotel in downtown Belfast,"We stayed at this hotel for 6 nights. We could have stayed there forever.
Location - perfect. It cost us 10 pounds (including a tip) per trip from the airport and back with a taxi. The magnificent city hall was just down the street from the hotel. The shopping district was a short walk away. The Opera House was next door and the oldest pub, The Crown Saloon was down the road from the Opera House.
The staff - excellence in everything they do. The staff were friendly, professional, knowledgeable and extremely helpful in ensuring that we had an awesome stay. Special mention goes to Mathew (front desk). Dermot and Zi (concierge), Siobhan O' Sullivan (director of Sales and Marketing) and Caroline Matthews (Deputy GM). The Black Cab tour that Zi suggested gave us an opportunity to understand the challenges that the people of Belfast experienced. We got to experience so much of this magnificent city in such a short time because of the guidance and direction of Zi and Dermot on where to go, what to see and where to eat.
The room - we booked the studio suite. It is 39 square metres. It is an awesome room - spacious, modern, luxurious, warm and inviting. This room type has panoramic windows that basically fills up the entire length on the one wall. You have stunning views of the city and beyond. The bathroom is spectacular. The biggest shower that I have experienced in a hotel - his and hers showers. There are huge fluffy white towels and indulgent toiletries. We got the newspaper everyday and mineral water. There was a Nespresso coffee machine and the most decadent shortbread and hot chocolate. We also enjoyed a turn down service and were treated to a delicious box of chocolates every night,
We had the opportunity to view other rooms in the hotel and they were all luxuriously decorated and spacious. The Deluxe room is 38 square metres, the Superior room is 30 square metres and the Signature room is 28 square metres. The rooms and bathrooms are all well laid out thus creating the spaciousness. The highlight was the penthouse at 116 square metres. 2 bedrooms both en suite with spectacular bathrooms, a dining room, kitchenette and  lounge with spectacular views.. 
We did not use the restaurant or the bar as we were out most of the time. 
We did however have hot chocolate, coffee  and croissants in the lobby with the previous owner and creative genius of the hotel, the incredible Ms June Burgess. After meeting June one understands the ethos that pervades the hotel and the professionalism, nature and attitude of the staff that work there.
The lobby is trendy and cozy with a delightful fireplace.. The perfect place to hang out on a cold day.
This hotel ticks all the boxes. Thank you to everyone at The Fitz William for our incredible stay in Belfast.",5,2017,02,23
226,Staff Make it a Five Star!!,"This is a beautiful hotel in downtown Belfast and has all any 5 star hotel would have, but what raises the bar on this hotel is its staff. We were greeted and helped at check-in like no other hotel I have been in. Nothing was too much trouble. I have to give a special shout out to Philip, the concierge. We talked to him about going to Bangor, driving the Antrim Coast and then driving to Dublin all in one day. He didn't discourage us but brought us back down to reality and had us rethink our plans. What we ended up doing took us 12 hours and that was without the drive to Bangor or Dublin. It was a wonderful day! The next day he arranged a Black Cab tour all within a few minutes. The location is amazing as it is right downtown.",4,2017,02,21
226,Great location for our needs!,"My partner and I stayed in this hotel to celebrate his 30th birthday, we had a fabulous time and our room was fantastic. We particularly liked how big and comfy the bed was! The location was also great and we were able to walk to many of the places we wanted to go to, such as the meeting points of the GOT tours we attended and many fantastic restaurants. The service was great and we really enjoyed our breakfast and also the drinks we had at the bar downstairs.",5,2017,02,20
226,Very nice!,"This is a very nice hotel.  We were upgraded to a suite upon arrival.  That was a terrific room.  Really large, very well fitted out and nice and quiet.  It was in the 8th floor and had a fantastic view of West Belfast and the hills beyond.  We didn't eat breakfast there, to be honest there are a number of excellent establishments offering breakfast within a 5 minute walk e.g. Harlem Cafe.  The staff were really professional, helpful and friendly. The bar was quite small but intimate.  One downside, only two lifts, for a hotel with 9 floors üò±

Nice place though and we would be happy to stay again.",4,2017,02,19
226,Fantastic Location,"We have stayed in the Fitzwilliam on a few occasions now and keep returning for a few reasons...
1) Location - couldn't be better, literally a couple of minutes walk into city center, lots of nice restaurants and bars nearby (just beside bus and train station if arriving on public transport. 
2) Great service - staff are very helpful and willing to help (e.g we had left our concert tickets at home, staff printed fresh copies off for us within minutes) 
3) We love the style of this hotel, lovely public areas and rooms are decorated well, quite dark, but this adds to relaxed feeling, rooms also have nespresso machines which is a nice touch and beds are very comfortable.
4) The bar, the cocktail menu is great!!

There are however a few things which let this hotel down considering it is 5 star. The breakfast being one, limited continental selection, hot food is ordered from a menu, I had the fry on one morning and was just a bit underwhelmed with it, as was my husband. Pastry selection didn't feel overly fresh. 
Note if using parking to ring ahead and make sure they reserve room for you as we had to use a local car park as the hotel one was fully booked. Also if wanting to have afternoon tea book well in advance as this was not available for us either. 

All in all we do love this hotel and when in Belfast it is our ""go to"" place and we look forward to our next visit.",4,2017,02,19
226,Five Star....ish?,"A good four star hotel which looked at the list of criteria required for five stars without really hitting the mark. 
Staff were lovely- pleasant and efficient and the public areas are also very impressive. Our executive room was spacious, clean and well appointed. However it was let down by poor quality bed-linen and towels and mis-matched, threadbare robes. 
As is the case in most hotels, electric sockets were in short supply and not where they were most required. 
The requisite tea tray was tucked away in a cupboard (with a mean selection of mediocre teabags, plastic milk and poor quality biscuits) but in order to actually prepare a hot beverage the kettle had to be balanced near a socket on the other side of the room on the floor...no thought put into the actual guest experience.
A feature of the hotel is low lighting and dark surfaces which is very restful but really not helpful if you're female and need a brightly lit mirror for makeup application...a small point I know but an important one!
Sadly, my favourite part of any hotel stay was the most disappointing - breakfast! Efficient seating and a brief explanation of the ""procedure"" - a fairly run of the mill buffet with the usual fayre...definitely not what I'd expect from a hotel of this calibre.
A dead flower in a vase on the table should have given us a clue that the focus here was not on quality but this was confirmed when the portion of pancakes with bacon and maple syrup arrived and the plate contained two re-heated, slightly burnt pancakes with ONE slice of bacon and synthetic maple-flavoured syrup...so disappointing!
Perhaps none of these are big issues but put them together and they are symptomatic of a hotel which really doesn't deliver - such a shame as it's in a great location.",4,2017,02,18
226,World of luxury,"Staying there after the daughters arranged a Christmas present of the Buddy Holly story in the nearby Opera House and an overnight in the Fitzwilliam.
From entering the Hotel the Staff could not have been more helpful. Service in the Restaurant was first class and attentive. Food was of an excellent standard.
Location is right in the heart of the city and is not affected by passing traffic noise.",5,2017,02,18
226,Comfortable,"We stayed here for two nights and found it to be warm, welcoming and beautifully decorated. The room (executive) was lovely, with the comfiest bed i have slept in for a long time, and the attention to detail was great. USB port above the plug socket, little candle in the bathroom for a cosy bath time, huge shower cubicle which made a nice change. I had read some complaints about the church bells but despite being very close they really weren't intrusive. The concierge bent over backwards to help on a number of occasions. And the breakfast was great, i'm a fresh fruit and yoghurt girl which can be challenging but all was available and my husband enjoyed his full irish breakfast. The bar was a bit hit and miss, the service varied. My only negative was that we departed at 6am and requested a breakfast to go - we were asked if we wanted tea or coffee with that. But at 6 we left with a bottle of water, pear, and tepid pancakes. It went in the bin (sorry!) A tea/coffee and a pastry would have been much more appreciated. All in all a great stay and we would visit again.",5,2017,02,16
226,Cocktail Class at The Fitzwilliam,"We had a weekend in Belfast for a friends birthday and as part of that we booked a cocktail making class at The Fitzwilliam.  To be honest I wasn't really that bothered about doing it but went along anyway.

How wrong I was!  The class (run by Bryan) was excellent - we had great fun and actually learned a bit about the history of certain cocktails - why things are measured so accurately - why we have to shake the cocktails hard and for what reasons and why the use of a large amount of ice is so important.  Bryan certainly knows his stuff and he kept us thoroughly entertained for a good few hours - he was the perfect host for us and we thoroughly enjoyed it.  

You get a selection of canapes - which actually were fantastic mini cheeseburgers, chicken fillets and chips - plenty to feed us all.

If you're in Belfast and want something a little different to do then I would highly recommend this - the service we received before, during and after the class and the setting in this hotel was fantastic. The cost is definitely worth it given the fact you have 2 generous cocktails, plenty to eat and the un-divided attention of your tutor.

Thank you so much Bryan for going that extra mile and ensuring we had such a fabulous Sunday afternoon.",5,2017,02,14
226,One of Belfast's Best!,"A lovely hotel with really good quality accommodation (seemingly quite rare in Belfast).  Friendly and helpful staff, bar food's good, breakfast is very good and the bedrooms are fantastic and very comfortable. The gym is a bit of a let down but otherwise I think the Fitz is a great place to stay for a few nights.",4,2017,02,13
226,Beautiful decor and excellent location,"Stayed for two nights here. Room was beautiful. Large, warm and clean. Could hear the church bells during our stay but I found that to be a novelty. Breakfast was delicious and my partner raved that it was the best breakfast he has ever had! Wide selection and cooked breakfast arrived quickly. Cocktail bar was  excellent. Only thing that could be improved on was the lack of bar staff on a busy weekend. Try were blatantly under under pressure and service was slow in the bar. Really enjoyed the DJ and music played in the bar on Sat evening. Staff at reception were warm and friendly on arrival and could not do enough to help! I would really like to thank the concierge team. They really stood out from the rest with their professionalism, courtesy and sunny demeanor during our stay. They were always willing to offer advice and help whether it be with the car, bags or information about the city and how to get the most out of our stay. Their team were a credit to the hotel. ",4,2017,02,13
226,Bar,"Brian in the bar is a fantastic ambassador for this hotel and the city of Belfast. Thoroughly recommended . Couldn't do enough to make a quick drink a very memorable experience, friendly, professional and an asset to the hotel ",5,2017,02,12
226,Another fabulous stay!,In Belfast for business I decided to stay at the Fitzwilliam after having stayed there previously. Wasn't disappointed! Love that place. The room was immaculate and beautifully decorated. Dinner in the bar was very tasty - mac & cheese with bbq  pork belly. Breakfast was also good. Great selection. The staff as always were polite and friendly. I was sorry not to be staying longer. üòä,5,2017,02,12
226,Spotless Room!,"Arrived to a warm welcome from the reception staff, room was on the third floor opposite the lift.  Despite being opposite the lift neither me nor my partner heard a sound.  Availed of the gym on the 2nd floor, it is small with cardio equipment and free weights.  Towel and water are provided which is a nice touch.

We did not eat in the hotel, but the hotel is close to many great restaurants catering for all budgets.

The hotel is located in a very central location in Belfast, steps from the Europa and Great Victoria Station and Aircoach stop on Glengall Street.

Shooping on Donegall Place is approximately 5 mins away with many high street shops and Castlecourt Shopping Centre and the upmarket Victoria Square approximately 7 minutes away.  If in town on the weekend Georges Street Market is worth a visit for food.

Overall, I would return in a heartbeat, luxury and great value with a convenient location!",5,2017,02,12
226,Pure luxury in the heart of Belfast,"I only stayed here for one night with my colleague during the week but I have to say I was very impressed.  We were greeted warmly by the lovely doorman Gerald and upon entering the two girls at reception were quick to attend to us and issue us with our room keys.  The room was immaculate and furnished to the highest of standards and very spacious with an extremely comfortable bed.  I was also massively impressed by the standards of service in the bar and in the restaurant where we dined.  The food was also exceptional.

I simply can not recommend this hotel any higher, you will be treated like royalty.",5,2017,02,10
226,Hen Party-5 Star stay ,"What can I say!? There is a reason why this hotel was recently awarded 5 star! It was superbüëåüòç the rooms were impeccable, the cleanliness was also fantastic! The room that we stayed in were stocked with tea's, coffee and bottled water and when we rang out of milk my friend had rang reception to see if they could bring some extra up, the staff were prompt at doing so! The rooms were so luxurious and the decor was beautifully presented, we stayed on the Saturday and left on the Sunday, the only thing I would have to say is the breakfast menu didn't really have a great selection of hot food in comparison to other 5 star Hotels that I've stayed in however the staff were so friendly in the restaurant! I'll definitely be back here to stay! ",5,2017,02,08
226,Overnight stay ,"This over night stay in a 5 star hotel should be rated more of a 4 star hotel 
Facilities in the room where ok
Disappointed that only one coffee sachet for brewed coffee on the cafeteria pot provided 
Should have a slide out shelf for the coffee hot water pot 
Pointless to have a music center inside the cupboard with speakers there when also One is provided in the room
Cleanness of the room was ok but table was dirty with a ring cup mark on it bed was made up but lacked the person touch in some ways and not made up on the side correctly 
Curtain not put on straight at the window 
Did not know the key needed inserted when I realised this was difficult to put on the slot at the door 

Hotel has just recently received 5 star ratings and I am actually surprised it received this 5 star rating for the facilities atmosphere cleanness etc  and what it offers over all - more attention to detail needed to have 5 stars ",3,2017,02,07
226,Very comfortable,"Clean, modern and spacious. Staff very helpful and polite. Central location near the theatre and bars. Apparently only a few quid more than the Holiday Inn! 

The only negative was a shower was a bit of a fine mist but otherwise fab. ",5,2017,02,07
226,Less Than Spectacular,"It's a nice hotel. And after a hard day at work, it's wonderful to come back to a pretty room. HOWEVER...

My room was located on the second floor. Odd number. 

The first thing I noticed was the smell coming from the bathroom. A sewage type stench coming from the bathroom that grew stronger and stronger...I assumed it came from the pipes. If you don't close door to the bathroom, you'll return to a room that smells like hell. And yes, the bathtub is beautiful and tempting, but there's no relaxing to be done when you're suffering through that smell. 

I'm not sure how the tea kettle situation was in other rooms but mine was a bacteria trap. I'd made afternoon tea, and after became pretty sick. I didn't connect it until a couple of days later, I'd prepared the tea kettle after my recovery, and noticed a film of scum floating at the top of the tea cup. After checking the kettle, I noticed it was filthy.

I'd also return to my room and the room cleaning was spotty.  One day, the room was spotless, the next day, it seemed as if it got a quick wipe down as an afterthought. 

Lastly, I hope you are sound sleeper. The church across the street is beautiful, but those early morning bells don't give a damn about you.

The continental breakfast was great, the staff was appropriately polite and again, a beautiful room, but I slept better (and breathed better for that matter) at lesser hotels.",2,2017,02,07
226,Loved this hotel!,"Great hotel! The room was spacious, modern and had a ton of natural light. Very clean and great attention to detail. Walk in shower and lots of towels/robes was definitely a plus for us after a long day of being tourists. Room service breakfast was probably the best Benedict I've had. Staff was very helpful between suggesting shopping and restaurants to booking us travel plans. Just so happens we got engaged in Belfast so this beautiful hotel just added to an unforgettable trip.  ",5,2017,02,05
226,Quality city centre hotel,"Good quality City center hotel, The staff are very professional and helpful. I was a bit surprised that the hotel has recently been awarded 5 stars, feels like a good quality 4 star hotel, and just seems to lack the quality and personal touch expected of a 5 star hotel

The room was very comfortable, and breakfast was good, the ingredients were of a high quality and served by friendly staff.",4,2017,01,31
226,Birthday Stay,"My partner had booked a night here for my 30th Birthday, What can I say, beautiful first class hotel in the heart of Belfast as soon as we arrived we were looked after, valet parking, room upgrade, even a complimentary bottle of wine to apologise for the refurbishment that was beginning early next morning, our room was very luxurious the decor was modern and relaxing, fluffy bath robes, White Company products, its the little touches that make this a 5 Star establishment, oh and the bar staff can definitely make a great cocktail.... Will definitely be back next time I'm in Belfast. My kind of hotel I am even missing the clock chimes",5,2017,01,29
226,Best hotel in Belfast,Great hotel - friendly staff with really good rooms situated in the heart of the city. Stayed as a family for a city break and impressed with helpfulness of the staff and great breakfast served in the chic restaurant. Will stay again in the future.,5,2017,01,29
226,Overnight stay ,My son bought this stay for my husband and I as a Christmas present. When we arrived the valet took our car and parked it then to our surprise Matthew at reception upgraded us to the penthouse. We were shocked and when we walked through the door absolutely speechless. The penthouse was amazing with everything you could think of. It was gorgeous and we had a great stay. Just one slight disappointment when checking out we were charged 17 pounds for one nights parking. We feel this was quite expensive and also we weren't aware that there was a charge. We love the hotel but next time we won't be taking the car. From colette kane ,5,2017,01,29
226,Great hotel at very convient location,"My wife and I stayed at the Fitzwilliam Hotel for 2 nights in January. We had a great stay!
 
The hotel lobby is very beautiful, the ladies at the reception very kind and the concierge(s) very helpful, they even helped us print our boarding passes.

The room (604) was very clean and nicely decorated. There was a great number of amenities, even earplugs and playing cards. The turn-down service was a nice touch (chocolates!).

We did not use breakfast (20 euro pp) at the hotel because there are more then enough more affordable options in the direct vicinity of the hotel.

The only small downside was the isolation of the single layered windows. If you sit on the couch, cold air 'breaths' down your neck. You can also hear noise from the street.

But overall I would definitely recommend this hotel!",4,2017,01,28
226,Luxury ,"Our first time in the fitzwilliam we only selected this hotel for the location as we were going to the Grand Opera House - which is next door. Our food was super and was included, however it would have been very expensive if it wasn't we got two normal cocktails that cost ¬£20 the most expensive I have ever paid and not worth it. Staff were clearly struggling with the work load as we had to wait for concierge and wait again while they got our car and no mention of asking us if we wanting our bags taking up to our room. 

It wasn't  excellent but it wasn't bad either! ",3,2017,01,27
226,"Mismanaged, understaffed, bad value","Stayed with my partner while on a business trip.  I run a craft brewery in England and was interested to check out the emerging craft industry in Belfast.  We enjoyed our meal and quality of drinks provided but it was very apparent that even on a Friday, the bar was understaffed.  

We were primarily served by a very mannerly and polite tall gentleman (and a younger male) who ensured that we had great levels of service and remained apologetic and informative regarding our wait/situation.  He recommended cocktails according to our taste preference and was happy to make cocktails that weren't on the menu.  Excellent White Russian!

The wait between drinks was too long and the staff were clearly overwhelmed/overworked.  This was no fault of the bar or waiting staff.  Management should be able to gauge suitable amounts of staff needed for a busy night.

Our room wasn't up to the standard of other 5* hotels (even within Belfast) and we generally considered the breakfast to be underwhelming.  I generally felt we were staying in a 4* hotel with frontline staff who were really going the extra mile with no support of management.  Our shower power was weak and our radio/cd player was faulty.  Our welcome kit was not fully stocked either.

On that basis, I wouldn't recommend people stay in the hotel if they're after 5* quality.  I will try the Merchant next time.",2,2017,01,25
226,Most welcoming hotel I've been in,"Stayed on Saturday night as a birthday treat and I have to say the experiance was amazing. From the booking of the valet service, through to check in, the evening in the bar, breakfast and then check out, it has to rank as my best hotel experience. The staff were so friendly and welcoming throughout. Valet service was seamless and efficient, and remarkably good value. Check in staff were very friendly and accomodating. Cocktails in the bar were as nice as any I've had in Belfast. Rooms were reasonable size and very well appointed, small bit of noise from the road but it was Saturday night. Next morning breakfast was delicious, I love getting break fast served to the table, at least its fresh and hot and no bumping into other guests. Don't know why it took me so long to stay here, but I definitely will be back!!",5,2017,01,23
226,Disappointed ‚òπÔ∏è,"I normally love this Hotel and have raved about it to all our family and friends. We have stayed many times. The reception staff was friendly as usual and our rooms gorgeous with all its plush new furnishings. Looks great!
It was the restaurant that left us disappointed. We had brought our friends to stay at the hotel so we booked the restaurant to have dinner in. The menu has changed from the last time we stayed. Not a great variety at all. My starter wasn't great and had a hard lump of grizzle in it which put me off. So watch the ""Ham Hock""! Our server wasn't very helpful at all. Our friend asked could he get a steak as it wasn't on the menu, we didn't mind paying an extra supplement. The server replied "" No"" it's on a different menu and it would be really expensive!
We asked what the sides were with the main course and told ""roasted vegetables"". Nothing else!! We asked again could we get anything else, and ""No"" was our answer.
Our mains came with no sides at all. I told our server who brought them to our table when we had all finished our dinner. A bit late. He didn't really care, just shrugged his shoulders. Not great service from a 5 star hotel! We did speak to the Manager who was very apologetic. 
Overall a bit disappointing!",3,2017,01,22
226,Trendy hotel in hip ciity,"I have stayed in hundreds of rooms across the world and I must admit I was delighted to stay here, my room although small was beautifully decorated, and that made the size less of an issue.  We used a meeting room at the top of the hotel and the view was great, seeing over Belfast and the cavehill.  The staff were great in the business suite.  One little issue was they have totally over engineered the use of the plaza screen for presenting, instead of a cable you have to hook up via the internet and this was pretty cumbersome to set up each time we needed to switch lap tops.

The restaurant was lovely and we had a hearty Christmas lunch, but I did miss windows, so you feel like you are inside a mall or an airport.  The downstairs bar was disappointing as most seats are in booths a bit like an American diner so not great when sitting three deep, maybe it was my colleagues but I felt a little trapped.

That all said I would stay here again, its location, staff and d√©cor make up for the little niggles, oh and also I spotted a few actors from Game of Thrones in the tiny lift!",4,2017,01,21
226,Nice Hotel,I regularly stay at this hotel and always get great service.  The rooms are well sized and always clean.  Has a well stocked bar and good menu.  Food always served hot with the attentive staff always on hand to help.  My only gripe is as a guest in the hotel a few occasions when the restaurant is fully booked and having to go elsewhere to eat - as a paying guest you would think you would be able to eat in the hotel.  Never had any other issues and location is excellent.,4,2017,01,20
226,Fabulous room,We stayed for one night and the room was amazing. You get a wee bottle and mini treats in your room upon arrival and a fabulous bed. The room is the nicest hotel room I have ever stayed in. I think it was on a deal for  ¬£130 for the night but I was gonna take my husband there on Sat 21 Jan and it's ¬£210 for the night so is very expensive but luxurious. There was refurbishments going on then which took the shine off a bit so it could be a lot nicer at the moment. It's a one off treat though.,4,2017,01,18
226,This is NOT a 5 Star Hotel,"Yes this hotel is central and the bedrooms are clean and well appointed but the food in this hotel falls way short of even 4 star standards.
How about luke warm food served in the bar and most of the food was processed frozen food. What about the lack of any fresh juices at the breakfast buffet or what about canned fruit! I wouldn't expect to see canned fruit at a 3 star hotel.

Who rates these hotels - it is not or nowhere near 5 star except for the prices!",3,2017,01,17
226,Great after Christmas break! ,"This hotel is a real gem in Belfast great staff beautiful art deco everywhere. The bedroom even if slightly too small look bigger with all the mirrors and reflective surfaces. The bathroom is elegant and even found a replenished mini bar. The breakfast room is located in the restaurant downstairs and the food is excellent. Value for money is so good we will back sooner than expected. The location is also great right in the city center, walking distance from all shop places like Victoria Square.  Belfast is a vibrant city lots of things to do. Highly recommended ",5,2017,01,17
226,Amazing ,"We stayed for 2 nights for my birthday. My mum left a little gift for me in the room and the front of house staff wished me a happy birthday, little touches mean a lot to me.
The room was big and the bed was really comfy. Breakfast was delicious, continental buffet and order hot food. The hot food we ordered was lovely and the buffet had everything you needed.
All the staff we meet were really pleasant and could not do enough for you. Highly recommend this hotel.",5,2017,01,17
226," Very good indeed","Stayed here for one night recently as an Xmas present. The staff are first class, very pleasant and professional. The room was clean and well proportioned with a beautiful bathroom (we were on the six floor). We didn't eat in the hotel restaurant but had a drink in the bar and again service was first class. Enjoyed breakfast in bed as a treat (which isn't cheap as there is a ¬£10 tray charge) but it arrived on time and was very tasty. Really good hotel in the heart of the city - not the cheapest but you definitely get what you pay for. Hopefully stay again very soon.",4,2017,01,16
226,Overnight on Friday 6th Jan 2017,"One night stay, having been to Viennese Gold (Ulster Orchestra - under the baton of Christopher Bell). Staff are polite and accommodating, the hotel deserves its 5 star status. Enjoyed a bar meal before the concert - the house burger was very good. Full Irish breakfast was piping hot and served in the breakfast room. Service was quiet and efficient without being intrusive and a wide selection of breakfast choices was available. There were a number of large groups usinf the hotel that evening but we still managed to find a quiet corner for a drink and a chat.",5,2017,01,11
226,Excellent stay,Had an excellent stay in a beautiful large room. The rooms are decorated to a high standard and are very clean. The staff were always helpful and welcoming. The hotel was a cosy place to return to after a busy day sightseeing. If I was to return to Belfast I would definitely stay here again.,5,2017,01,11
226,Great staff.,"Once you step foot in this hotel you can tell it's highly rated from the reception area and the well trained staff. The staff were all brilliant.

Once in the room I thought it was a little on the small side for a 5* but it was well finished.

Breakfast in the morning was lovely. One of the best frys I've ever had at a hotel!",4,2017,01,10
226,Christmas Eve in the City,"We were in this hotel on Christmas Eve as members of our family were staying in the hotel on Christmas Eve night. 
We were in the lobby and the bar on Christmas Eve during the day both before and after the matinee performance of the Panto which was on next door in the Grand Opera House. 
We had three young kids with us while we were in the hotel and the staff in the hotel couldn't have been more accommodating. 
There was a lovely Christmas feeling in the hotel and it was a lovely way to spend a Christmas Eve - they were serving mulled wine and mince pies in the lobby.
Our family members who spent the night in the hotel reported that they had a lovely stay - even getting a little Christmas gift bag with a pressie in it when they checked out on Christmas morning!  How lovely! 
Thanks Fitzwilliam for being part of our family Christmas Eve celebrations.  We have already booked tickets for the panto again next year and will be coming in to your hotel both before and after!",5,2017,01,09
226,"Great hotel, lovely staff","This is a great hotel with very helpful and polite staff. I have stayed in most of top hotels in Belfast & this was is in my top 3 for customer service. 

The only downside was the rooms were smaller than anticipated. 

Look forward to returning. ",4,2017,01,08
226,New years,"As always,this hotel never disappoints.decided to beat the crowds and stay for new years.went to the bar where we found a lovely booth and were treated to some first class cocktails by the very pleasant and attentive staff",5,2017,01,05
226,"Lovely hotel, great location and rooms, but breakfast needs some work!","We stayed here one night whilst visiting family, and it was the perfect location for us to finish our Christmas shopping. The valet parking was very useful and the check in process was friendly and efficient. We loved our executive room, which was huge. The bed was a great size and the whole decor was really well done. Everything looked well looked after and quite new. I especially loved the welcome box with the hotel information and mints etc to munch on. 
The only downside to this hotel was the breakfast. The food was lukewarm, and the breads served were all very dry. Toast was not served with butter, and the mushrooms were undercooked and tasted awful. It was probably one of the worst hotel breakfasts I've had in a hotel as highly rated as the Fitzwilliam, and made me reluctant to try their restaurant for dinner. If there were some big improvements on the breakfast this really would be a fantastic hotel. 
Overall everything else about this hotel was great, the staff were all very warm and friendly.",4,2017,01,04
226,Perfect destination ,"Highly recommend this is a perfect hotel.i have stayed in nearly every hotel in Belfast and this by far is the best. Everything from reception to bedroom to bar and breakfast the staff go out of there way to help you.

The rooms are very modern and the comfiest beds. Breakfast is to Die for all freshly cooked to your liking. We asked if was ok to make our own breakfast up nd this wasn't a bother at all. 

The bar has a very smooth atmosphere perfect for a quiet drink or some great cocktails.

Very close to shops an very good resturants. Didn't eat in hotel resturant due to birthday meal but I'm sure if is fantastic also.

If can afford to spend an extra wee bit there's nothing compares in belfast",5,2017,01,03
226,Beautiful hotel but,We visited the above hotel on nye check in was perfect room was great we had dinner in hotel fish & chips my partner had the burger we ate in the bar because although we wanted to go to the restaurant we arrived there to be told it was fully booked end of conversation I explained that we were staying in the hotel but that didn't seem to matter I know it was nye but no attempt was made to help us .The next morning we went for breakfast which was included in our package there were no teaspoons on the cups my partners breakfast wasn't very warm we were brought toast which no butter or jam or marmalade offered until I asked for them we checked out and I left my email for the Duty manager to contact me still waiting ,3,2017,01,03
226,Bad smell in the room,"We normally stay in the Europa Hotel but booked the Fitzwilliam for new years day/night as a change I cant fault the hotel for its comfort and surroundings but there was a dreadful smell in the room possibly coming from the drains in the bathroom I did report this matter twice to staff but the problem was never sorted, apart from this I cant fault the hotel the meal we had was superb. The smell in the room might make me think twice about staying here again in the future.",3,2017,01,03
226,Great hotel if staying in Belfast,"Stayed in an executive room, end of December.

An excellent hotel centrally located in Belfast; large room with comfortable bed, beautiful en-suite, friendly staff and impressive lobby.

The concierge were particularly helpful with interesting recommendations and bookings.

Would recommend if staying in Belfast. Would choose this hotel again.",5,2017,01,03
226,Professional friendly bar staff,Just wanted to say a big thank you to the bar staff following a recent visit to Belfast before Christmas. We popped in for a couple of drinks and the bar staff were very welcoming and pleasant. in particular  a young barman - Colum Casey - made up a cocktail for me not on the menu. Really good service and next time we will stay in this hotel. Thank you,5,2017,01,02
226,Wonderful,We had booked this for our Christmas present . Hotel was beautiful staff where friend and very helpful. We stayed in the suite room well worth the money dinner was lovely as was breakfast but the wait for breakfast was a little long but with a hotel being busy I don't mind as the food was lovely. Will be back again ‚ò∫,4,2017,01,02
226,Breakfast Nightmare,"Requested breakfast time 10-10.30 am arrived 10.55 am,it wasn't in a hot cupboard, plates were stacked on top of each other with dirty plate covers , food not overly warm,strawberry yogurt  was ticked plain yogurt sent,1 smoothie & 1 orange ticked 2 orange was sent,2 butter croissants ticked  cold Pain au Chocolat & Pain au Raisin sent,toast was ticked no toast came,2 pancakes with syrup & berries ticked  2 pancakes and bacon sent , 1 omelette with 2 saus ticked no saus arrived and omelette had different filling than requested and just to top it all 1 tea 1 coffee was ticked and we received 2 small pots of tea which was cold and made with 2 different tea bags. Really disappointing as not the service you would perceive from this hotel. Apart from this extremely disappointing breakfast we had a very pleasant welcome  our room was very clean and tidy,  keep up the great work Housekeeping.",2,2017,01,02
226,Don't bother with breakfast ,Nice hotel with friendly staff.. I've stayed here on numerous occasions and always take breakfast and each time it's been a long wait.. but my last visit was a total disaster.. the restaurant was busy but that is no excuse for having to wait well over an hour.. we had ordered tea and toast and had to ask for it on three occasions despite other tables coming in after getting served first.. when we finally got our toast we had to wait we'll over an hour to receive a fry and an omelet.. I was getting extremely frustrated as by the time we got served it was 10.30 and check out was 11.. I would stay here again as it is a lovely hotel but wouldn't have breakfast. ,3,2017,01,01
226,Lighting down bedding,"Have just spent  3 nights at the Fitzwilliam. Great service, great breakfast.
Must say the smoke alarm going off at 1230am was not welcome.
Two major complaints - not the most comfortable beds - there needs to be a top cover on beds so edges are not noticed and lighting in room totally inadequate especially in bathroom where even with the best eyesight could only guess when applying makeup!!",4,2016,12,30
226,Wedding anniversary ‚ù§,Had never stayed before but was not disappointed. Staff friendly and breakfast tasty. Room was lovely and great size which felt like a real treat! Bath nice with candles/matches all supplied. This hotel felt like a real treat and we will definitely be back. üíû,5,2016,12,28
226,just ok,"wasn't overwhelmed with this place, no real atmosphere, staff were ok, not rude but not overly friendly, bit pricey for the service and quality you get but wasnt the worst place ive ever been - went out for dinner and that is what saved the night! would probably come back here if it wasnt so pricey for what you get",3,2016,12,27
226,A Proper hotel in Belfast . . .,"If you wish to be assured of a pleasant stay when visiting Belfast then you will be hard pressed to improve on the Fitzwilliam.

Everything was as expected, a Suite is the way to go if you can - a fantastic room, set up perfectly with nice mood music.

Breakfast was super and desk staff efficient, only thing I would like to see is some sort of Smoking Terrace/Area (internal or on the roof) its not cool standing outside at the front door because you need a cigarette.

What I liked - no I mean I really really liked . . . . and other up-market hotels in Belfast need to take notice of this point . . . 

  I booked the Fitz after finding it online for a few quid cheaper via an online offer (it may have been only ¬£7 or ¬£8 quid) but the reservation staff dealing with me was very professional in the way it was handled and quickly verified and matched the price with good grace.

This was five star service.

We have since stayed in a standard room and although it may lack the niceties of The Suites it was an enjoyable visit and we were treated as well as our first visit.

Book direct with the hotel for the best deals and if you can spring for a suite ""Do It"" - its worth the extra.

B.V",5,2016,12,26
226,Christmas Day disappointment ,"Visited this hotel for lunch on Christmas Day. What a disaster. No welcome, no atmosphere , no effort and appalling service. So very disappointing. If this is the standard why bother opening on Christmas Day?",1,2016,12,26
226,Another Fantastic Stay,"We stayed on 22nd of December and once again our experience was absolutely amazing. From check in to check out all staff were so helpful going the extra mile ,the Fitzwilliam is the must stay destination in Belfast . Looking forward to staying again in 2017 . Go Team Fitzwilliam .",5,2016,12,23
226,Amazing ,Not much to say the food and service was top notch couldn't have asked for much more. The meal we had was excellent all the staff were very polite and I hope that someday I will be back again. Excellent place ,5,2016,12,22
226,Fantastic room ,"Lovely hotel, check-in was quick, as was check out. Deluxe room was very nice but the shower seemed to be faulty as it would turn either very hot or very cold every few minutes. Unfortunately breakfast was not at the same standard as the rest of the hotel; if I had of known this I wouldn't have payed for in when booking the room. The ¬£17 charge for the car park is extortionate and something that was not mentioned until we were walking out of the door. I enjoyed our stay, would avoid the breakfast and carpark if I were to stay again however. ",4,2016,12,20
226,Fantastic stay at a fantastic hotel! ,"This is the 2nd time my partner & I have stayed here and both times are fantastic!! From the moment we walked in until we left the service we received was absolutely fantastic! Every member was very attentive & professional. Checking in was easy and effortless, we even got our bags taken to our room so we could enjoy our lunch. The rooms are phenomenal, the refurbishment is amazing and so appealing! From the little touches in the rooms, to dinner, to breakfast not one bit can be faulted! Definitely worth the stay all year round & we will definitely be backüòÅ",5,2016,12,19
226,Exceptional service,"We had a lovely 3 night Christmas break and it was perfect. The staff were lovely and helpful, giving us useful information about the sights of Belfast and arranging taxis for us to make everything easier. The hotel itself is in an excellent location and was right around the corner from the Christmas markets and tour/hop on-hop off bus station.

The room we stayed in was excellent, spacious and clean with plenty of great amenities. It even came with an umbrella that came in very handy!",5,2016,12,19
226,Christmas Lunch Service,"Our team from work booked Christmas lunch at the Fitzwilliam because 3 years ago we had excellent food and service.
Well on Friday's (16/12/16) experience we will never be back again.
As each person finished their food the waiting staff pounced to remove our plates. It was like some crazy form of speed waiting service. So  we had people who felt pressurised to eat faster so that they were not holding up the next service. So trying to relax and properly enjoy our food was not on the Fitzwilliam agenda.
We ate up left with a bad 'taste' in our mouths. The food was well cooked and presented but they might as well served us hot dogs  at least you could eat that on the go. Besides the food we spent ¬£200 on drinks and unlike last time we were there we didn't take advantage of their ground floor Bar facilities. The only bonus in that was  another local pub got our custom instead. 5 star hotel with a Christmas service that you might find in a Dickensian novel. We will never be back!!",1,2016,12,19
226,Fantastic central location ,"From the minute you pull up at the front of the hotel nothing seems to be a problem for the lovely friendly staff.
The hotel is a perfect location close to the centre of Belfast.
The room are very well decorated with everything you will require for a few nights stay.
We have stayed in a lot of hotels over the years and this one is up there with the best of them.
Would highly recommend to anyone if you can find fault I would suggest you take a good hard look at yourself.",5,2016,12,17
226,Christmas Do,Lovely hotel but music from the DJ was MUCH too loud. Impossible to have a conversation. Had to either shout or make gestures to each other. Please tone it down! Not fitting for an upmarket hotel! I literally could not hear anything my friends were saying and it resembled a nightclub atmosphere. ,2,2016,12,16
226,"Beautiful hotel, central to everything","You can't go wrong with booking this hotel, the staff, location, and room are exceptional. The rooms are spacious and well appointed, not too modern not too dated and breakfast at the hotel is outstanding.",5,2016,12,16
226,Don't go for the food especially Christmas Dinner,"Went here with good expectations for a group Christmas dinner after being here 6 years ago and was also disappointed then.  Unfortunately this was to be another let down.  At ¬£35 a head I expected something of good quality and quantity but got far from it.

Starter (Potato and Leek Soup) - Bland, lukewarm and very little of it
Main (Sirloin of Beef) - Bland, lukewarm, beef was chewy and potato borderline cold
Dessert - (Christmas Pudding) - Not hot enough again, very small and underwhelming. Some of the guys had chocolate tart which looked like a chocolate finger and tasted bitter.

I am a guy who will always finish his meal and this case I didn't and had a real gripe handing over ¬£40 for this and a pint which they only have Heineken, no other beer on draught, extremely poor.

The rest of the party I was with agreed this was not worth the money paid for it and we will not be back next year or anytime soon.  The service was ok but no coffee or tea was offered to the bottom half of the table and not even an after dinner mint.

I would recommend not eating here to anyone as this is the second time I have been let down.  The food not being hot enough is just not good enough and there are far better and cheaper places to eat within a short distance.",2,2016,12,16
226,Excellent Hotel with great staff in great location,"Had been recommended this hotel by colleagues and wasn't disappointed.
Asked for quiet room (as find sleeping in strange bed difficult) - and although room was at the back of hotel (so not a great view) room was perfectly quiet.

V comfy bed and huge bathroom.  Yummy breakfast and good selection of options available.  Great bar staff

Really perfect hotel and will return!",5,2016,12,13
226,"Great location, very friendly staff ","Stayed in hotel for 2 nights, room was very nice and very clean. Great location, about 5 minute walk from the centre of everywhere. Organised to go to titanic experience and the reception arranged a taxi with no problems. Lovely reception area.....wish we tried the afternoon tea. ",5,2016,12,12
226,"Excellent Hotel, Close to Everything","The Fitzwilliam has it all for the business or leisure traveller. The rooms are modern with all necessary features, including coffee maker. Mine had a large (very) walking shower, bathroom and dressing area. The service in the hotel was also fantastic making you fell appreciated. Breakfast was excellent, buffet and menu and reasonably priced - Full Irish breakfast about ¬£17. If you happen to be in Belfast in December, be sure to catch the Christmas Fair; only a short walk from the hotel.",5,2016,12,11
226,Outstanding,"This is one of the best hotels I have ever stayed at. It would put Jury's and the Hilton to shame... spotlessly clean,  brilliant staff and large spacious comfortable rooms. I would definitely recommend this hotel to family and friends... can't wait to stay again!",5,2016,12,10
226,A Good Nights Sleep,"A well positioned hotel just a block from the City Centre. Great breakfast served in the morning.
The bed was a good size but the quilt could of been a little thinner for me, though the other half found it OK.
Good quality towels and robes
Plenty of Tea, coffee and chocolate to drink.
Would use again",5,2016,12,07
226,a little bit of luxury,"A great location centrally located .Arrived by train and Victoria Station just a few minutes walk  ( The Famous  Crown Bar across the street and Grand  Opera House next door.)  . A warm friendly welcome by staff and this was the case by all staff throughout our stay. Very impressed with room 724  . Very spacious and stylish -  the bathroom amazing  wheelchair accessible .Could do with some hooks or perhaps a shelf as no where to put own toiletries. Loved the little touches  - the presentation box on desk with all you need - remote, pencils, earplugs, playing cards candle and matches in bathroom etc The little box of chocolates in the evening. . Umbrella provided for your stay, bathrobes and slippers. Hairdryer and ironing facilities,  Room safe and tea making facilities.
Breakfast excellent-  buffet and  table service. Lots to choose from - a  great selection of fruits, yogurts and juices,cereals, cheeses breads pastries.Enjoyed a Full Breakfast and the omelettes were delicious.  Didnt have dinner here during our stay on this occasion.
Thoroughly enjoyed our stay and cant wait to return.",5,2016,12,04
226,Fantastic Property!,"We loved the Fitzwilliam Hotel!  It was very centrally located - you can walk just about anywhere in Belfast.  In addition, it's just around the corner from the Crown Bar (a famous landmark - you must have a drink there) and down the street from several great restaurants.  The room was incredibly modern and well maintained.  Highly recommend.",5,2016,12,03
226,Do you really want more,"A great location, very warm and friendly staff and spacious well-appointed and equipped rooms. Nothing was too much trouble for any of the staff including those at breakfast who were attentive and welcoming. Would happily return to the hotel on my next visit to Belfast.",5,2016,12,03
226,Don't be fooled by the outside!!,"Outside this hotel doesn't look like much but once you get into your room you are in for a treat! This place is magnificent! I like my 5* hotels to give me that little something extra and this hotel delivers! Like the little touch of a candle and matches by the bath, a deck of playing cards in the room. They are subtle things but they impress! Room was spotless clean and the bed very comfortable!

Breakfast was lovely and what you would expect of a hotel like this.

My only complaint was I was only here for one night and I would so have loved another few nights!! Beautiful and classy and I can't wait to come back again!",5,2016,12,02
226,Great child friendly hotel,"Recently stayed for two nights n Belfast.  We had our 7 month old son with us. Really lovely hotel. Nice style. Nothing was to much trouble for the staff. On two occasions we asked could we get a small portions of food for the baby. Never an issue, freshly cooked meat an veg. Anyone who has travelled with young kids will understand what a bonus this is. Can't recommend this hotel enough. And it's really central",5,2016,12,01
226,Worth every Star,"Just back from a 2 night stay in the lovely Fitzwilliam hotel, we stayed two nights in the studio suites what a treat. 
We booked two nights BB and one evening meal. I can't fault this hotel the staff are so accommodating and friendly. Thoughtful attentive I could go on. We had room service and eat in the restaurant to be honest as beautiful as it is the food was not that impressed with but I wasn't expecting much as it was on a package. 

Overall I can't fault this hotel in anyway we are returning for New Years and in Feb for another few nights of luxury. 

Thanks to all the staff for making it yet again a memorable stay ",5,2016,11,29
226,Absolutely amazing place 10/10 !,"This hotel was amazing, we went to celebrate my boyfriends birthday for a few days and the hotel was fantastic.
The room was spacious and the beds were incredibly comfortable, the staff were so attentive as well, could not ask for more. 
The room was well equipped and was absolutely spotless with the maids visiting every day. ",5,2016,11,28
226,"Excellent, 5*","Stayed Saturday 12th November, booked with Lawrence in reservations who was a delight to deal with! Very helpful and accommodating.. Very pleasant check in and check out by the lovely Nicola on reception. All staff were pleasant, room was spotless. Breakfast had a great selection, truly could not fault anything. 
Will be back again.",5,2016,11,21
226,Post theatre drinks,"We nailed it, as far as post theatre drinks goes. I am so happy we decided to come here.  The bar is dark and chilled, the staff were lovely and we had table service all night.   There was plenty going on but didn't feel cramped, they have tables set in brilliant places, so we were able to tuck ourselves away in a corner.
I cant think of a better place to go after the theatre, its right next door.
This will remain on my hit list the next time we go to the Grand Opera House",5,2016,11,21
226,"Gorgeous hotel, central location","We recently spent the weekend in this fabulous hotel, which has beautifully designed features everywhere. The room was lovely, spacious with every comfort. We did upgrade  for a bathroom and this was well worth doing as the bathroom was gorgeous, with a large bath and shower. The staff were friendly and attentive, nothing was too much trouble. The hotel is in a fab location next to the centre of the city where we spent time shopping in the wide choice of shops.  The nightlife was good too and we partied til late at Kremlin's gay night club with all the ghosts and ghouls celebrating Halloween!  We rounded off the weekend with a visit to the awesome Titanic museum staying late to watch the fireworks.",5,2016,11,19
226,Amazing,Fantabulous place location and staff - would def recommend and would come back and double quick!  Smack in the middle of the city a great place to base yourself and enjoy luxurious surroundings - staff from doormen to reception and bar staff are all very helpful and courteous ,5,2016,11,18
226,Wonderful ,"We stayed here for a few days for a city break.
An absolutely beautiful hotel, lovely big spacious rooms. The staff were exceptionally helpful and we very much enjoyed our breakfasts.
Shall certainly return.",5,2016,11,18
226,Great Hotel Good Location,"This is a great hotel in the centre of Belfast and within easy reach of some great restaurants.

The evening meal in the hotel restaurant is not amazing, quite clinical and lacks a bit of atmosphere.

The rooms are clean and tidy and the bed is very comfortable.

I will definitely be back.",4,2016,11,17
226,"Brilliant, can't wait to stay again!","Stayed in a good range of hotels throughout Belfast and the Fitzwilliam is the front runner by far! Outstanding customer service throughout the stay, beautiful modern decor, spotless rooms/ensuite bathrooms. Excellent location! Easily one of the best nights sleep I have ever had in the executive king room. Highly recommend!",5,2016,11,16
226,Very nice Hotel - Recommended for business travellers,"Very nice Hotel - Recommended for business travellers.
The Hotel Lobby is modern.
Location is very good, near the city Hall and train/bus station.
Room is spacious and clean.
Breakfast is very good with variety of choice.",5,2016,11,16
226,Excellent. ,"I've stayed in a few hotels in Belfast and this is probably the best all rounder. While certainly not a budget hotel, neither is it wildly expensive. The service from each and every member of staff was exceptional and the room itself stunning. My only slight criticism if I had any at all was the stained effect glass in the dresser mirrors and behind the headboard, it left both things a little unusable. But essentially this place is outstanding and with a bar that can hold its on in the city there's few places that can match it.",5,2016,11,15
226,Probably the best in Belfast. Definitely the coolest.,"I've stayed in the Fitzwilliam Hotel Dublin so I was expecting something with a lot of style and great service. I wasn't disappointed. One other thing these hotels share is perfect locations: This one in right next door to the opera house on the Golden Mile - it's perfect. It's just been redecorated so it looks great, the people can't do enough for you and the rooms are big, comfortable and funky. Would I recommend? Would I ever...",5,2016,11,15
226,Art Griffin,"My wife and I had a fabulous stay in the FitzWilliam Hotel lately. The staff were so friendly and helpful. We really enjoyed how central we were in t city. Next door we attended the theatre and enjoyed t shopping only 5m away from t hotel. TheTitanic Centre was only 10m away and was awesome. Belfast City Hall was well worth a visit and Crumlin Jail was a must. The black Taxi tour was very interesting also.
Dinner and breakfast in t FitzWilliam was delicious and t room so comfortable. 
Top marks to Manager Cian and his efficient and friendly staff. We will be back soon!
",5,2016,11,14
226,Birthday ,"We came for a suprise birthday party...everything was brilliant especially Patrick in the restaurant! He had a brilliant attitude, brilliant manner and brilliant enthusiasm.
He was so good that him alone would bring us back to the fitzwilliam!
I had a great birthday and thank you Patrick for making it that much better!!",5,2016,11,13
226,Best hotel to stay in belfast,"I love everything about staying in the fitzwilliam, the service is fantastic. The rooms are so luxurious and the bar and restraunt staff were very helpful also. I have had a pleasant time here each time I have stayed. Treated like royalty throughout my stay whether it was one night or three. Really recommend.. 10/10! Also a fantastic location right beside grand opera house and train station and a few minutes walk from city centre. ",5,2016,11,13
226,Really great stay. Would highly recommend :),"Had a really great stay at this hotel on a Friday night special offer rate which included 2 cocktails; and an excellent breakfast. Every member of staff was so friendly and helpful. Lovely, spacious comfortable room with excellent bathroom & amenities; plenty of tea /coffees",5,2016,11,12
226,Best hotel in Belfast!!,Stayed on night under the date night offer. The hotel is beautiful. The staff are the nicest and most friendly I've ever met. They remembered my name throughout my stay! The rooms are finished to a very high standard and the breakfast was great. I will definitely stay here again!,5,2016,11,12
226,wonderful hotel and staff,"Upon arriving at this hotel we were greeted at the front door by miss Slugocka ( front of house manager) who welcomed us and took our luggage, check in was painless. The deluxe room which was splendid was located on the 4th floor. We had bar food the first evening and we dined in the restaurant on the second, on both occasions it was delightful. The one negative is that the booths in the bar are unsuitable for eating of food due to the height of the tables. Any and all staff we encountered were pleasant and helpful.",5,2016,11,11
226,Pre-Wedding Drinks,"This review is simply about the bar. 
We came here the night before a wedding as one of our party was staying here.
We ordered a couple of rounds of drinks and desserts. Love the sour apple cocktail (I think it was called) and the chocolate brownie was cooked perfectly! This is truly a 5* place, the presentation of everything was immaculate. 

(p.s. Theon from Game Of Thrones was here)",5,2016,11,08
226,Amazing Night in this Wonderful Hotel,"Stayed in this amazing hotel last weekend with four of my friends to celebrate one of the girl's birthdays. From the minute we arrived to the minute we loved we were treated so very well. Gorgeous reception with wonderful staff. After check in we went to the Bar for some lunch and were served by a lovely waiter who couldn't have been more helpful or pleasant. The rooms we had were gorgeous with great attention to detail. The beds were very comfortable with everything we wanted such as hairdryer, iron, tea/coffee making facilities, robes, slippers. After eating out in Belfast we came back to enjoy delicious cocktails until late in the Bar. Sunday morning we had a sumptuous and very relaxed breakfast. This Hotel is in a brilliant location in the very beautiful city of Belfast. My only regret is that we were only there for one night and I will definitely be returning in the New Year.",5,2016,11,07
226,Luxurious relaxing break.,"We spent three nights recently at the Fitzwilliam and we could not rate it highly enough.We had a delux room on the 5th floor overlookingthe city. Evrything in the room was brand new. It was very bright due to two glass walls and the temperature was just perfect. There was a nespresso coffee machine as well as tea and coffee making facilities and a very generous supply of tea and coffee pods.The bed was very large and comfortable and placed in the center of the room with the work station behind the bed which is a very good idea as if one person would like to read while the other takes a nap light is not an issue.Traffic noise is not a problem as on a high floor it is a mere distant hum.There is a lovely chime from the bells of the church across the road and they only start at 9a.m and finish at 9p.m. There was a turndown service which we didn't avail of but we certainly didnt refuse the lovely little boxes of chocolates each evening which were just perfect with the nespresso. The bathroom was large with a big bath and long ""walk in""rain shower. Just one point of constructive criticism-It would be handy to have a shelf to place wash bags on rather than putting them on the floor.Breakfast isvery good and hot food orders are taken individually so your breakfast is not sitting there all morning. We ate in the bar one night,in the restaurant another and at Flame restaurant across the road the third night. The food in all three was good.It is important to book parking as it is limited. it is valet parking and the concierge service is great.They even went to the car for us to bring us the charger we forgot.Parking is ¬£15 a night which may seem expensive but you ar within walking distance of evrything and therefore not paying for parking in shopping malls. The staff at the hotel ar exceptionally friendly and courteous",5,2016,11,07
226,Average second visit ,"This is my second visit to this hotel given I had great experience back in February this year. Checked into room 617 and was put off by the stained mirrors. The bathroom lamp shade was also full of dust and yellowish. Clearly needed to be replace soon. Bathroom toiletries was in a better packaging this time but smells like men frangrance! Got knocked at the door by housekeeping whether I need a turn down service which I've never requested. It was annoying as there's a card in the room saying turndown services are provided on request before 7pm.

Had dinner at the restaurant at level 3 but meal was bland and cold. I ordered the lemon grilled chicken and seasonal vege as side. The side was warm and tasty which was probably the best part of my meal. 

I will be considering other hotels for my next visit.",3,2016,11,06
226,Shabby ,"I stayed in this hotel last night
With my wife.
On a positive note it is very well located being close to the centre/ good restaurants and bars etc. The staff are very friendly from valet parking/ concierge/ bar staff and reception.

This unfortunately is let down by the poor quality room. Carpet lifting off the floor/ light coming off mirror in bathroom/ long hairs (previous guest) in shower etc.

In my opinion this is not acceptable when charging ‚Ç¨250 a night. We asked to change room once we entered but unfortunately none were available. I explained all this to reception this morning and they apologise for same.",2,2016,11,06
226,R,"Stayed here last December and plan to stay again early in 2017. Great location, room clean tidy,warm and contemporary.  Lounge area not that big but comfortable seating.  Bar area not really encouraging to hang around as not much going on. Breakfast was good enough

You need to book your car parking space and staff drive the car to park it, which isn't great. Hotel right beside opera house and in centre of things so car not required. ",3,2016,11,06
226,Birthday,"Went for my partner's birthday, stayed in a studio suite room the mountain view is amazing. Very peaceful and relax. The room was stylish and well designed. 
Staff were very welcoming,  friendly and efficient in servicing (Check in check out, concierge, bar and restaurant). Would defo recommend to try cocktails in the hotel bar, they were amazing.
This hotel is now first on my list to stay in Belfast.",5,2016,11,06
226,1 night stop over,"I stayed here for on Friday night  1 night in Belfast. Staff very friendly, very nice room overall a beautiful hotel. However I ordered a medium rare steak at the bar it came out well done  . Then the morning of breakfast my wife and I ordered hot breakfast,  10 minutes later the girl came back to check what we ordered. Then 30 minutes later no breakfast and all the people who ordered after us were getting their food we said it to the waiter and we had it within 5 minutes.  Maybe needs improvement on the service side of things in my opinion. ",3,2016,11,06
226,Excellent decor,"Stayed for one night for a dinner reservation in town. Rooms are cosy and impeccably styled. Check in process was swift and the service was lovely. We asked for wine to be delivered to the room when we checked in, and it was delivered within 15 minutes. Great central location- highly recommend! ",5,2016,11,05
226,Well located,"Nice modern conveniently located hotel, that does everything well. Genuine greeting from the staff, nice freshly cooked breakfast and great choice , bed is large and comfortable , a bit to go to rival the Merchant and the only negative is the annoyingly poor wifi otherwise excellent ",4,2016,11,05
226,Group outing restaurant,"A group of us - 22 ladies - had dinner in the hotel after a theatre matinee at the Grand Opera House. The booking was so easy, the restaurant delightful and the food excellent, with a good choice/good value menu, and nicely presented dishes. From reception to sales managers to waiting staff I found everyone very professional and pleasant. I would definitely recommend the Fitzwilliam Hotel and we will certainly be back....",5,2016,11,05
226,Beautiful hotel,"Gorgeous room..I didnt mind the chiming bells...reminded me that I was on hols and didn't have to get up for anything.
We had valet parking but it was pricey and should have been included with the price of the room!
Concierge was super friendly and helpful!
Breakfast wasn't up to standard for a 4 star!
Lobby is fab!
I would stay here again but I'd go somewhere else for breakfast!",5,2016,11,04
226,Excellent Week,"The staff at the Fitzwilliam went out of their way to be helpful and friendly. The rooms were large, clean and nicely decorated. The location is excellent, the Robinson and Crown bars several blocks away, and the Grand Opera next door. The only downfall was their Wi-Fi service. The concierge tried to help with my phone and IPad and the hotel had the service call me, which helped for a day, but then lost it again for several days. If I had been in town on business the WI-FI would have been very frustrating. Overall it was an excellent stay and I would return.",4,2016,11,02
226,Love it,"I've stayed here 3 times already and would always try and get a room here when in Belfast. The hotel is close to everything, breakfast is very good and staff are friendly. The rooms are a very good size and I love the colour arrangement. It's modern, clean and the bed is extremely comfortable.",5,2016,11,02
226,Disappointing,"We stayed here last night and it wasn't what we expected. We parked in the set down area expecting valet parking as we couldn't find the car park. The receptionist told us they had a car park but it was full!! At a 5* Hotel??? We had to walk, at night time to a nearby car park. No valet parking, not even a car park.

Our room was beautiful and not overheated as can often be the case. Bathrobes were very badly worn but everything else was really lovely and hygienic. 

Very poor choice of food and slow service in the bar.

Bells from a nearby church go off every half hour from early morning.

Breakfast arrived cold. Only 1 sausage & 1 rasher each. 

All in all, mediocre

",2,2016,11,01
226,Excellent venue for that special weekend city break,"From the outset at check in we were made to  feel very welcome by Matthew,  and all the staff were very efficient and friendly. The rooms were very spacious and well appointed. The food at evening meal and at breakfast was of a very high quality. Limited parking. Ideally situated for grand opera house,bars and shopping. ",5,2016,11,01
226,family holiday weekend,"This is a Top Class hotel from top to bottom. The Rooms are very spacious and well set out. Its located slap bang in the city center for all the pubs, You are within walking distance for the shopping centers.",5,2016,11,01
226,Best there is,"I've stayed in a few good hotels in Ireland over the years but this has been the best so far, quality rooms with great comfort 
Food was excellent and staff where great at helping with choice of food and wine very. Close to everything you need from shopping ,restaurants ,cinema ,bad nightclubs
",5,2016,11,01
226,Excellent hotel...to be recommended...good value for money,"Staff very helpful and welcoming...room very good,clean and spacious. Little extras like choccies on the bed at night, candles in the bathroom.
Also wi fi available free.
Excellent breakfast, lots of choices and hot food ordered and made for you...prefer this to a hot buffet

Great central location, right beside the bus station",5,2016,10,31
226,Ok but nothing special,This hotel was always on our to do list.   Had our first visit here this weekend and as nice as the hotel is I don't feel it was any more special than other hotels that cost less.  Reception staff were very good and friendly with a quick check in.   Rooms are nice but so very warm and there are no windows to open.  The aircon worked fine but it was too noisy to leave on through the night.  There was nowhere in the bathroom to leave a toilet bag.   One small shelf which wouldn't hold much.  Went to the restaurant for the set meal (part of the deal dinner b&b).   Food was ok but feel there could have been a bigger selection to choose from. The menu stated mains were served with selection of sides and according to the waitress this was sides of mash potatoe and fresh vegetables which we never received.  We didn't want to wait around for the desert so staff arranged for this to be delivered to our room which was very good of them even if we did have to wait about 45mins for this.  Breakfast was fine and check out very quick and easy  A nice hotel but would I stay here again. .. only if I got a really good deal. ,3,2016,10,31
226,Loved it!,"I have not a bad word to say against this hotel! It was absolutely beautiful in every way! The room was clean, and the lay out was perfect! And that shower, wow! We dined in the restaurant one night during our stay, slightly pricey but was expected, and worth it as the food was gorgeous! We also sat in the bar quite a bit! I enjoyed numerous cocktails from the large selection offered, whereas my partner enjoyed a nice cold beer! The staff where the friendliest I have ever dealt with, willing to help with whatever I asked with a large smile! Service was excellent! Would definitely recommend this hotel for a comfortable and relaxing stay, plus it is close to all the amenities, shops, opera house, bus station and nightlife! ",5,2016,10,31
226,4 star hotel?,"Having paid full rate for an executive suit at the 4 star, Fitzwilliam Hotel Belfast, we did come away thinking we would have had as pleasant experience staying in some of the cheaper hotels in the city.

1.  On arrival only 1 receptionist at desk, taking a rather long call from what seemed like an unhappy customer, (everyone can have a bad day) however she did not even have the courtesy to acknowledge us. 
2.  The room had no view, but clean and tidy.  On entering my eyes immediately descended onto the tear on the front of the sofa.  On lying down on same said sofa I noticed a cluster of wires hanging from under the table?  Moving into the bathroom there was paint flaking on the ceiling of the shower?  I could be really nit picky & say that the Egyptian cotton duvet was not of the higher quality thread count I enjoy at home (but that's just my own little eccentricity).
3.  Breakfast - left a bit disappointed with the Ulster fry, again for the price paid we did expect better quality beef sausages and the black pudding was very spicy, but otherwise good.

Overall a good weekend the other staff members were pleasant, it was a very clean hotel, we enjoyed the bar area & the music.

However the points mentioned above are the minor details you put up with when residing in the cheaper hotels in the city, but a 4 star?  

Would we stay here again? For the money paid, the answer is no.",3,2016,10,31
226,Great location and service,"Stayed here two nights in a superior king room.  We were on the 5th floor so very quiet even though the street was below.  Loved the turn down service and chocolates left on the bedside.  Large bathroom with nice sized tub and separate large shower.  Good toiletries and robes.  The hotel is right next to the Opera house so if you are seeing a performance this would be an ideal place to stay.  Also it is only 5 minutes walk from the train and bus station so an easy connection to other cities.   Staff on the front desk, bar and concierge were all helpful and efficient.  I would stay here again.",5,2016,10,30
226,Comfortable and Relaxing hotel at city center,"Very nice and comfortable hotel, the ""Yes we can"" style. 
The rooms are extremely comfortable and spacious, the bed and linen are very good, room cleanliness is excellent. Room temperature control is also very good.
I wasn't impressed by the breakfast, I generally don't like having limited selections in the buffet and for extras you need to order from the busy waiters.
The location is brilliant, it is close from everything you may need to see.
The staff are mostly helpful and friendly, trying to keep your stay enjoyable.
WIFI connectivity is very good.",4,2016,10,30
226,We'll-designed and comfy stay!,"We regrettably we're only in town for a night, but we loved every minute of our stay! The rooms were clean and modern and the bed was super comfy. We also loved the bar and restaurant. Great service and delicious food. We hope to come back soon!",4,2016,10,29
226,Lovely stay at the Fitzwilliam,Gorgeous hotel with spacious rooms. Stayed two night for a work trip and would definitely return for work or pleasure. Also had a very nice late dinner in the restaurant. The room rate was very reasonable as well. It's a very short walk to the city center area as well. ,5,2016,10,29
226,"Great staff, service and surroundings","What a fabulous hotel!  

The staff were so helpful, especially the bar staff!  We were a large party and used the bar as a meeting point and a 'nightcap' place.  We were not disappointed - the staff were so welcoming and there was never a hint of time limits on enjoying ourselves.

Rooms were great too and the reception staff were helpful and patient.

Breakfast was good (not fantastic) but once again, the staff were totally accommodating and ready to please.

Recommend a stay here.",4,2016,10,27
226,Another great visit ,"Another great stay at The Fitzwilliam, Belfast. The service is excellent, great location and fabulous rooms, just make a few days trip on business, more enjoyable. I'm looking forward to staying again the next time I am over on business in Belfast!",5,2016,10,27
226,Business trip,Stayed here 1 night for a business trip in August 2016. Had a room on the street side just above the entrance. Room was well equipped and the bed was great. Have no real negative items for the room and will come there more often.,4,2016,10,27
226,Candles by the bath,"This was my first solo trip so I was bit agitated. But I had a beautiful spacious room with every conceivable extra. Robe, slippers, tea and coffee. Even a candle by the bath in the fabulous bathroom. Bed was so comfortable! 
I had breakfast which did not disappoint at all. I ate from the bar menu in the evening and found the food delicious, especially the lamb belly.",5,2016,10,26
226,A joke of a 5 star hotel ,"Myself and my family stayed in this hotel last Saturday night and it is beyond me how this hotel ever received it's 5 star status. When we first arrived our room was not ready and so we decided to have some lunch in the hotel bar. The service was appallingly slow, the staff were blatantly rude and the food left a lot to be desired. We were in a rush to do a tour and had decided what we wanted to order, however, the waitress would not let us order our food until we had first ordered our drinks, waited 20 mins for such and then we were allowed to order. The ham and cheese panini that I ordered was was described as a sesame seed panini, however, what I received is what you would expect from the McDonalds Cafe. Even though we only ordered sandwiches and soup and there was only one other table occupied in the bar, the entire ordeal took about 1 hour and 15 minutes. When we returned from our tour there was no room in the bar and so we were informed that we could sit in the lounge and have some drinks. We had to ask 3 times to be served every single time we wanted a drink and each time we asked we were met with disgruntled employees. Prior to our arrival we had requested a childs bed to be put in the room for my 9 year old sister, however, I ended up sleeping on the childs bed at 25 years of age as the bed was too uncomfortable to leave a child in. It was a fold out bed with a massive ridge in the middle that dug in no matter what way you slept. The next morning we asked at reception if it was ok to head out for some breakfast and return at 12:15 even though check out was at 12. Reception informed us that this was perfectly fine. When we returned to our rooms at 12:07 our keys had been deactivated. I have never stayed in a 3, 4 or 5 star hotel that has deactivated keys that quickly. You would expect some leeway given the extortionate price of the room for such poor quality. When we eventually checked out we informed reception that we planned to walk to Victoria Square and asked if we would be able to leave our car in the car park until we returned. Again we were told there was no issue and were not given a return time. Awake rang the hotel at 3 to make sure we were still ok for time at which point they informed us that we were not and that we had to pick up the car within the hour. As someone who travels often both for business and pleasure, this was a highly disappointing hotel experience and I will not be returning. ",2,2016,10,26
226,5 Star,Located in heart of Belfast this 5 star hotel has 131 rooms.  It was opened in 2009 and is next to the opera. Rooms are quite nice with sitting area and nicely sized bathroom. Staff  formal but friendly. Good turn down service.  You wouldn't be disappointed with a stay here.,5,2016,10,24
226,Great meal,"Very good pre-theatre meal, good variety and price. Quick service and staff were friendly and knowledgeable about menu.  The restaurant is comfortable, only down side was the price of the water which was offered when we arrived and didn't realise that it was bottled water - ¬£4.50 a bottle which as we bought a bottle of wine to accompany our meal also was pricey.",4,2016,10,24
226,The Service Makes It,"I can't say enough how professional and pleasant the staff was, everyone was at the top of their game. And then add on to that the great location, the comfortable bed, the clean room, and the good food. We couldn't ask for more.",5,2016,10,24
226,Masterclass,What a fantastic Cocktail Masterclass we had on Saturday evening.  We booked this class for a birthday surprise for 2 friends and we all had a ball.  Brian our teacher for the class was amazing and he ensured we all had a blast. My face is still sore from laughing!  Will hopefully get to do this again and will ask for Brian to guide us through the art of cocktail making and shaking!   Thanks again Brian for making our evening so special xx,5,2016,10,24
226,The hotel gem of Belfast!,"From beginning to end, this hotel demonstrated the highest caliber of customer service, from the front desk staff to concierge to restaurant/bar employees.  The hotel staff also responded in a timely manner (less than 24 hours) to email inquiries both before and after our hotel stay.  The location is near perfect in Belfast Centre City, increasing the ease of getting around the city by walking or bus.  Rooms are modern and quiet. One of the concierge staff members went out of his way to actually walk us to a shuttle stop for a bus tour.  Every question asked was answered with diplomacy and helpful information.  This is first best decision you could make while visiting Belfast!",5,2016,10,23
226,Perfect Venue for Our Wedding Reception.,"From the initial planning many months ago to the end of our wonderful stay everybody and everything was well beyond our expectations.
The food and the layout ( we provided the materials etc) of our reception room was exceptionable. The staff are all very pleasant, approachable and helpful. 
We were married in the City Hall and had photographs taken in the Botanic Gardens. Belfast is a special place for us and we could not have chosen a more perfect Hotel or better place to get married.",5,2016,10,23
226,The staff make this place even better,"Though the only room they had available was a room which was handicapped accessible.  That did present a problem but on the flip side, I did feel very humbled and grateful to be ambulatory.
That said, the hotel was clean, the room quite spacious, and the breakfast delicious. Wait staff in restaurant top notch, while bar was a bit spotty.
Melissa at the front desk went above and beyond and was a delight.  Excellent concierge who recommended brian from black cab tours which was a trip highlight.",4,2016,10,21
226,The Fitzwilliam,"very clean, the staff was very helpful when we our bathroom sink had trouble draining they were there in 5 minutes and fixed the problem room service was very accommodating when we called down for ice they always brought us a bucket every time we needed it, if you are traveling to Belfast this is the place to stay.",4,2016,10,20
226,We loved it!,"I only spent one night at the Fitzwilliam and I would surely stay there again on my next visit to Belfast. Room 219  was prepared exactly as requested - superior twin and a scent free cleaning. It was attractive, spacious and immaculate. Great quality linens, large bathroom. We arrived prior to check in time (second occurrence of this is N. Ireland) and were invited to sit and have coffee in the beautiful and comfortable lobby while our room was cleaned. All we had intended was to leave our bags with the concierge for a few hours and take off. Instead, we sat, had coffee and read the paper until our room was ready in roughly 15 minutes. So nice! We headed out for the afternoon and returned to have a quick stop in the bar for a glass of wine before a brief late afternoon rest, read and cat nap. Nice bar, nice servers. All good.  Later, after diner in a nearby restaurant, we returned to a hopping Saturday hotel night bar for a wee nightcap and engaged in a pleasant, hour long conversation with a local couple. Ireland is the friendliest place on the planet.  Back to our room, everything ready for us to leave in the morning. I will admit that street noise was a part of the experience but not so so much that it was a big issue. It can be expected in city hotels on lower floors though some hotels have better soundproofed windows. Breakfast in the morning was fine - porridge and toast and coffee was all we ordered and off we went. Front desk had arranged the taxi for us and it was waiting when we came down.  Quick check out. We were very pleased with this hotel and thought it was good value.",5,2016,10,19
226,Modern Boutique Hotel,"Very impressive decor.  Had a large corner suite which was very well appointed and very quiet. It is in the city centre and next door to the beautifully restored Opera House.
It could have done with some drawers as there was nowhere to store clothing.",4,2016,10,18
226,Standard Room,"I had my second visit to the Fitzwilliam on 6th October having booked online directly with the hotel previously.  The room I requested was a standard room, on arrival I discovered the bathroom was for wheelchair customers, when I requested another room I was told that their standard rooms (only 1 on each floor) was wheelchair access bathrooms only.  I was so disappointed as these bathrooms are quite dangerous to use unless you actually are restricted to a wheelchair.  There is no curtain or door on the shower and the side mirrors are not usable unless you are very small in stature or in a wheelchair.  I lodged a complaint to the duty manager but got no satisfaction or offered anything by way of compensation, as I had also complained about my pre theatre dinner food which was very poor.  All in all my second experience to the Fitzwilliam was absolutely not acceptable and I will not stay there again and cannot recommend it to anyone.",2,2016,10,18
226,relaxing stay,"Visited Belfast for the first time and wanted a central location in which to explore and found it with the Fitzwilliam Hotel.  From the outset, customer service was first class and reception was friendly and professional.  The Concierge service was  both helpful and welcoming with nothing too much trouble.  Even printed off my flight tickets for the return journey to Edinburgh.  My husband and I were on the 4th floor in an executive room.  It was very clean and was a good size overlooking the main street.  Despite this the room was quiet when it was time to sleep!! We had both a bath and shower  to choose from with usual toiletries on offer. (just watch the shower as on day 1 it was extremely slippy but on day 2 less so).  Breakfast in the main dining room offered both cooked breakfast to order and a buffet style too.  Staff very attentive and helpful. This was just a short city break but found a couple of really lovely eating places within a few minutes walking distance of the hotel - an indian restaurant called nu dehli and a European restaurant called Ginger Bistro, not cheap but fantastic food.  We also had  lunch in the Fitzwilliam Bar with good light bites or full lunch.  Very tasty and the staff were friendly and attentive. Overall I would recommend the Fitzwilliam to anyone who wishes to be well looked after and be in a central location with lots of good eating places to choose from which suits every budget - oh and the Opera House is next door so that's a plus!! (we visited the titanic quarter and walked from the hotel it was a lovely walk and took about 20 minutes from the hotel). In the taxi to the airport the taxi driver suggested the Cathedral Quarter which offers another perspective of Belfast with lovely eating places too so maybe that is for another time!",5,2016,10,17
226,"Good property, nice rooms, modern decor","We stayed for a couple of nights whilst touring and were very happy. The hotel decoration is excellent although the view from the window was less impressive. As other have said parking is in the hotel car park and you have to hand over the keys.

We ate on the special offer dining deal Sunday night and it was not handled very well. We were initially given the full menu, then when we came to order my choice was not available, at which point we were given different menus with less choice which didn't include the items my wife had already ordered!

I said we would just pay the difference, but to be fair they didn't charge any extra, or charge me for choosing the cheese course when the dessert I picked was also not available.

The breakfast was excellent however and we were very lucky to spot one of the stars of a well known TV show.",5,2016,10,17
226,"A lovely hotel, restful, charming, friendly","A perfect venue for a restful evening after busy days. Bright and light room, lovely view, all necessities. Lovely bathroom, excellent cleaning, thank you to young Polish Lady.
Restaurant very pleasant especially the pub, with a lovely light menu and helpful staff",5,2016,10,17
226,Lovely staff and rooms,"The hotel style is like an upmarket Jury's Inn, modern, clean with a touch of ""Interior Designer"".

The concierge staff were welcoming and took our bags to our rooms, they do offer Valet parking but we chose to park on the opposite side of the road in the gated parking facility that gets us a discounted price (¬£14 per night).  

The counter staff are very approachable and helpful too.  They are able to suggest suitable restaurants from Bubbacue to the nearby Michelin star restaurant (prior booking is required);  the concierge may help here too.

The room (Executive King room) is roomy and well appointed.  It was nice to have an opening window, a rare find above 3 storeys.  It's nice and cheap too at just ¬£140ish per night.  

The wife was chuffed to be having dinner a couple of tables down from some of the ""Game of Thrones"" cast.  You may encounter the odd photographer outside.

Good central place to stay that doesn't break the bank (except for too many of the yummy ¬£10 cocktails).  
",5,2016,10,16
226,Excellent,"Not the cheapest, but perfect location, staff were friendly and helpful, breakfast was good and our room was comfortable with a decent sized bathroom! Oh and the bar does good cocktails!
This will from now on be our option when visiting Belfast.",4,2016,10,16
226,A very pleasant stay,"This was a short break, Sunday to Wednesday, for a family birthday and this hotel was ideal. Close to all the city attractions, very comfortable with a good bar for drinks and food. Special mention of the concierge staff is due who were all immaculately turned out and could not be more helpful. Would be sure to stay here again if back in Belfast.",4,2016,10,16
226,Lovely boutique hotel,"We stayed here for two nights on our first visit to Belfast. The hotel is very conveniently located to the city center, shopping and restaurants. The hotel is very clean, the front desk staff extremely helpful. We had a street room and is was surprisingly quiet. However, the couch in the room was the most uncomfortable couch I have ever sat on. That aside the bed and rest of the room was fine. We had one unfortunate experience in the restaurant when we tried to eat dinner there. We were seated, given menus and then ignored for the next three minutes. There was only one other diner in the room. As we were getting up to leave, a waiter finally came over and apologized. I'm sure it was just a one off moment. We love when we find smaller hotels that give you a relaxing place to unwind while traveling.",5,2016,10,16
226,Classy hotel,"Loved this hotel. Lovely lobby, quality rooms, both with expensive looking finishing which give it a classy feel. Staff were also lovely and it is very well located. Breakfast was also fine. Will definitely return.",5,2016,10,15
226,Beautiful ,"Stayed her for 1 night with my husband and it was beautiful.  Hotel spotless, staff very friendly.  Could not fault them. Room was amazing, they up graded us to a signature suite as we were celebrating our wedding anniversary. Such a lovely touch. Room was large very cosy and relaxing.  I could have spent the day relaxing in the room! We did have cocktails in the bar, again staff excellent. My only fault was that the bar was cold and not a place I would have stayed in for a few hours. We had a few drinks and food then we went shopping. The food was ok, a panni nothing too exciting. Breakfast was lovely. Would definitely recommend this hotel and at the I would most definitely return.  ",5,2016,10,14
226,Beautiful Hotel and Even Better Service,"We experienced our first trip to Belfast and were fortunate to have found The Fitzwilliam Hotel. Even before our arrival, we had some of the best service we've had anywhere. We called as we were driving (and lost) from the Dublin airport. The concierge, Philip, got on the phone and guided us in with specific directions. He was at the door concerned about us because it took longer than he and we expected. He told us he would take care of us for our stay, and HE DID! He told us the goal for the hotel is to be five-star, and the service seemed to be the beginning of reaching that status. Philip did so much for us and enlisted others in the process for our full three days. He arranged for a private car for a three hour tour of Belfast with Walter of Backpacker Taxi Tours. Walter was thorough, historical and fun! The Fitzwilliam staff and Philip, in particular, were superb. I say this as American woman who traveled extensively internationally on business for 10 years, and for my husband who was a world business traveler, as well. Stay at this hotel! You will not be disappointed! ",5,2016,10,13
226,Decent city centre hotel,"The hotel is located right in the city centre, convenient for the local restaurants and theatres. It's only about 10 minutes to George Best Belfast City Airport by car/taxi.

The receptionists are friendly and welcoming and the rooms are well appointed. I had a large comfortable bed, TV with channels, kettle with tea, coffee and a couple of complimentary bottles of water. The bathroom had a modern shower enclosure and bathtub.

There is a bar and restaurant in the hotel. I had breakfast there, which gave a choice of fruits, cereals, cold meats, cheeses etc as well as a la carte cooked items from scrambled eggs to full breakfasts. Once again the service was good and the food very nice.

The cost was fairly high for the room, relative to other hotels in the area and comparable cities, but all in all it's a good place to stay when visiting Belfast. The Opera House is a minute walk away, City Hall is 5 minutes and waterfront around 15 minutes walk.",4,2016,10,12
226,ENJOY,"We stayed in FITZWILLIAM 8/10/16 and from the reception staff,bar staff to the breakfast staff you can see how this hotel prides itself on staff training.The bedroom was very well decorared and very well finished.I hope it wont be to long before we return,and the same friendly staff are still there.THANKS AGAIN.",5,2016,10,12
226,"Lovely hotel, incredibly friendly staff",The best thing about this hotel is its staff. They were very friendly and nothing was too much trouble for them. The accommodations were clean and comfortable. I was disappointed not to spot any of the Game of Thrones stars staying there!,4,2016,10,11
226,Great hotel,"Stayed here over the weekend in a signature king sized room and was pleasantly surprised how spacious it was . Bathroom was a generous size with a separate walk-in shower and bath.
The staff are wonderful and extremely professional .We requested an early check in (10am) as my husband had flown in from USA and our room was ready on arrival .
Breakfast was excellent with a wide selection of cereals,pastries,yogurts ,fruit and the option of various cooked breakfasts.
This is a great hotel and we considered to be close to the city centre.",5,2016,10,10
226,"Great location, nicely appointed","Location great for Robinson and Crown pubs.  Price more than I wanted, booked week of arrival, tip price appears lower if booked a couple of weeks in advance.  Staff very friendly and helpful.  Suggest taking hop on hop off for good overview of city.  Ticket good for two days.  Room not as well lit that I would like.  Bed very comfortable.  Would stay again.",5,2016,10,10
226,Hats Off . . .,"The Fitzwilliam is in the perfect location for a city visit to Belfast, but its position on the hotel spectrum is not so clear. Is it a contemporary, boutiquey place with lime green scatter cushions or is it a traditional top-end place with top-hatted concierges ruling the roost over the reception lobby? The truth is it seems to be trying to be both of those things, which is a bit of an unhappy alliance. We were staying in a 5th floor suite, which did have views across Belfast's rooftops to the hills beyond (and yes, plenty of lime green inside), but frustratingly the picture windows don't open and there is no access to what could have been a really good terrace area outside. The place really needs a roof-top bar and the whole lobby/reception area needs to be loosened up - time to lose the top-hats.",4,2016,10,09
226,Wonderful Hotel All You Could Ask For,"We stayed for three nights at the Fitzwilliam and loved every moment.
Reception is professional and friendly and very helpful.
Our room was enormous and had both a shower and tub.  Only slight criticism is that whilst the bathroom is very large, there is not a lot of space for ladies to put all their wet packs.
We had a lovely corner room on level four and it was very clean and modern.  I think that the hotel is only eight years old.
breakfast was included and very nice indeed.
We actually had dinner at the hotel one evening and our  young server Patrick was very attentive and also happily told us places to visit and life in Belfast since the peace agreement in 1998.
His is a gem for the hotel- hope they look after him.
I am really surprised that the Fitzwilliam is not 5 star only 4.",5,2016,10,09
226,Great location beautiful hotel,"Our room was spacious and well designed. The hotel breakfast was great and the dining room was bright and comfortable. Staff was very friendly, professional and extremely helpful. Excellent place to stay when visiting Belfast.",5,2016,10,07
226,Great Location in the heart of the city,"This hotel is in good spot for walking around the city, whether for shopping or seeing the sights. Some great restaurants within a few minutes walking also. The WiFi is free and works well. The staff at reception, Concierge, and breakfast were all superb, and there are plenty of them to hand. The rooms are dimly lit, but then this is a ""Boutique"" themed hotel which is appropriate. Rooms are comfortable, warm (if you want them to be) and at least on the 6th floor it is very quiet with little to no traffic noise. The aircraft at the City airport can be heard flying over from early morning but I didn't come here for a lazy lie in! 

Of the negatives I would say there was a shortage of electrical plug sockets and those that are existing (3 in our room) they are not located well. The kettle if needed has to be plugged into a socket with the kettle either on the floor or standing on a bedside cabinet. The desk area has no accessible electrical socket, so if you need to have a PC charging whilst using it is not possible. The car park is Valet only and whilst is a competitive price and convenient, if you want full control of your vehicle you don't have it. We also had difficulty pulling up outside to unload and load the cases when arriving and leaving. It is stated there is a lay-by next to the hotel, which there is with room for two vehicles, but always seems to be occupied so no guarantee you'll be lucky for a space. You'll have to keep driving around the block or double park (which we did) but that can be dangerous with traffic passing you by. But, all that said, would definitely stay again when in Belfast and I recommend it. Prices are ok, (compared to other UK City prices). I booked one week in advance.",4,2016,10,07
226,"Excellent location, posh ambiance, great staff","Located right in the heart of downtown Belfast. 

Nicely appointed rooms. Great staff throughout the hotel. Jara at the front desk is absolutely outstanding!

A very short walk from the historic Crown Pub -- a must see location in Belfast. Also very close to a Hop On Hop Off tour stop and the train station.

Fabulous buffet breakfasts. Pleasant bar to meet up with friends.",5,2016,10,06
226,Modern Hotel in the Heart of Belfast,"Lovely, modern rooms with plenty of space to move around, which is unusual for many city hotels. Plenty of amenities to choose from, including TV and mini-bar in-room, and a bar/restaurant within the hotel. The hotel is close to everything. It's walking distance from the center of town (shopping), steps away from the bus station, and is surrounded by pubs, restaurants and convenience stores. I hope to stay here again, I highly recommend it!",5,2016,10,06
226,Lovely modern hotel in central Belfast!,"I was working in Belfast for most of January and on a few trips since then also and regularly stayed here. 

In short I find it a great central hotel, with nice rooms, friendly staff and good food - would recommend to friends family and colleagues alike!

In long (er) ... It's a good hotel for both business trips or city break. Very clean large rooms and lovely bath and shower!

The food is v good in the bar and found the waitresses and waiters chatty and friendly. I believe a test of a hotel for business trips is if you feel comfortable eating your dinner on your own in the bar. This was never an issue in any of my stays at the Fitzwilliam.

Breakfast is also very nice with a good selection of continental buffet bar and cooked breakfast.",5,2016,10,05
226,Best in Belfast.,"Try and stay here at least once a month.

Gretna atmosphere, especially late evening in the bar.

Food is top notch, from mid morning to late night.

Great helpful staff and knowledgeable concierge at the front.

Definitely the best in Belfast!!",5,2016,10,05
226,Fine older hotel.,"The Fitzwilliam is a lovely older hotel, with lots of extra amenities. We stayed only one night, but hope to come back to Belfast again in the future. Price seemed a little higher than other hotels on our trip. Nice restaurant, and really good breakfast. Overall service from staff was excellent.",4,2016,10,05
226,Great stay,"I have stayed here before and it doesn't disappoint. Great restaurant, especially good when heading out to the theatre. I love the modern feel of the hotel however some attention is needed to the sofa upholstery in the rooms as it is looking a little bit dirty. All in all its a super location in Belfast and everyone is helpful and friendly!",5,2016,10,03
226,Disappointing,"A visit to Belfast was my treat to my husband for his 65th Birthday and I booked the FItzwilliam for its location which is great and easy to walk around the city and great restaurants on the doorstep. BUT
Because we like twin beds the only room available was an accessible one which is fine. It just was really badly designed. I left a list with reception of the problems and expected some response but have not received any yet. So the problems were:
No hook in the wet room/bathroom to hang bathrobe; no shelf in the shower area for soap, shampoo etc; tiny hand basin that didn't hold enough water for a proper wash and was positioned very low and so close to the toilet you hit your knees on it; Basin too  small you couldn't fill the kettle so had to use a glass to top it up; the one tiny shelf was too small to hold your toiletries, shaver etc.; the electric plugs in the bedroom were all in one corner between the dressing table and the table with the tea/coffee facilities and behind a low hanging lamp shade that looked like a punch bag and behind the curtain; once you plugged the hairdryer in there was no mirror. Breakfast was a shambles with young staff who had obviously not had training. The first two mornings we had to ask if we could have toast. 3rd morning we were asked by the young girl but then it never arrived. We had to wave for attention to get service and generally there was always something missing off the table i.e.. salt & pepper, butter, knife, serviette.
I think the final insult was on Sunday evening when my husband ordered 2 glasses of port from the bar and they gave us Taylor's port which you can by for ¬£12 a bottle and charged ¬£20.
Not impressed..........",3,2016,10,03
226,Love this hotel,"After travelling around and staying at other hotels in Ireland, this one was a pleasant feeling of relief to stay in a lovely comfortable hotel. Staff are helpful and friendly. Rooms are deluxe and comfy.  Bed is a proper king and extremely comfy. Very spacious,  bathroom is also lovely with a large bathtub.  Room has a nice ambience to it.  I would definitely come back and stay again and this hotel is worth the extra.  I will miss this hotel when i leave. ",5,2016,10,02
226,Breakfast was very substandard ,"The Fitzwilliam is ideally located for shopping and dining out. Most of Belfasts attraction are with walking distance. The hotel is well decorated. We stayed in a superior king room which was very comfortable and spacious. One issue I did have was that there is a noticeable lack of electrical outlets near the mirror which causes issues for blow drying and styling hair. 
We had drinks at the bar and despite their extortionate price of ¬£9 each they were delicious. 
I had serious problems with the breakfast. I arranged for the breakfast to be included in the price of the room. If I had not done that I would have found it extremely difficult to pay the ludicrous price of ¬£17 for the cooked breakfast. First of all it took over 20 mins for the breakfast to be served. When it was it was disappointing in quality and quantity. 2 small sausages, a small piece of bacon, 2 tiny baby tomatoes, a egg and mushrooms. And all were very poor quality We also ordered toast which did not arrive. There was no staff around for us to ask about the toast and it was only when we both had finished our breakfast that someone attended to us and finally arranged for our toast to be served. Far too late. The orange juice was concentrate and tasted cheap. 
So essentially the service and quality of food left quite a lot to be desired at this 5 star hotel. I'd probably consider other hotels before I would return.  ",3,2016,10,02
226,Fantastic spot,"Stayed a night with my girlfriend before she had an interview in Belfast. 

The room was amazing, with a massive comfy bed and sparkling clean bathroom. 

The staff could not have been more helpful too. A real 5 star experience!",5,2016,10,02
226,Treated like royalty with outstanding customer service!,"Outstanding in customer service!my husband and I stayed here on the 30/9/16 for our wedding anniversary with the package GOT deal and we were treated like royalty from book in to check out.  The room was spacious,gleaming clean and very well equipped. I would have loved to have used the room service for breakfast but the service charges for room service is over priced at ¬£10 per tray, given the price of the room it shouldn't be there at all but it's up to you if you use it or not.  The restraunt was very elegant and the breakfast was delicious with a very good variety however I felt let down with the 4 course meal, the menu was far too limited and not enough variety of choice. The valet service was excellent and paying the additional ¬£17 charge for parking is well worth it.  The bus station, theatre, cinemas, shopping centres, pubs and even the opera house are within a few minutes walk.  Over all we had a fantastic experience and will definitely be staying here in the future.",5,2016,10,02
226,Upgraded room and it still disappointed.,"Let me start by saying the staff is very night, especially Joey at the front desk. Very helpful and pleasant. She is the only reason this place received an extra star so I hope you're paying her well but based on the rest of this hotel, I think she could do much better. 

Place is an absolute rip off. The room was a kip, dirty Windows  ¬£17 to park the car for the night. ¬£17 for a breakfast along with a ¬£10 tray fee. And here is the best part:

I call down for a bit of grub at 22:45, not long after the kitchen closed and there was a limited menu. I call down and get told to hold. After waiting I am told that I will be transferred. After being transferred I am told I have to call the front desk. I call the front desk and I'm told it's been busy so the limited menu is missing some things. It's been too busy and not being prepared is not a valid excuse. Needless to say i had to venture out at 23:00 to find something to eat because this hotel can't adequately stock the kitchen. 

Do yourself a favor, save your money and go somewhere else. ",2,2016,09,28
226,Great welcome and personal service...,"Had a one night stay at the beginning of September; the staff made us feel very welcome, being friendly and obliging.
Rooms were spotless, comfortable and well equipped.
Good selection of breakfasts on the menu.. the full Irish was delicious!
Hotel is well placed for the city centre and its attractions, as well as The Crown and Fibber Magees almost opposite, for refreshment and good music.",5,2016,09,28
226,Excellent hotel with very friendly staff,"Very nice hotel with very attentive and helpful staff. Excellent location, a few minutes walk from bus station with plenty of shopping centres and restaurants within 10 minutes walk. Would definitely stay again. ",5,2016,09,26
226,Mums Birthday Supprise!,"This hotel is just fab! I adored absolutely everything about this hotel, it really was a lovely treat to take my mum for an overnight stay in this hotel for her birthday!

The Hotel itself is beautiful, from the lovely entrance and lobby to the corridors and rooms, fantastic! The room itself was gorgeous, really nicely decorated, the bathroom was gorgeous, bath and shower in the room, spotlessly clean! The room had all te usual tea/coffe making, hairdryer etc... even a mini bar! But the addition of slippers and robes just always make it a little more special lol!

I added on Breakfast to the room as an extra treat and wow am I glad I did! The breakfast was delivered right on time by a lovely member of staff, she was so polite, wheeled the table in and asked if we needed anything else!

I will most defo be back to stay in the Fitz it was fab! :)",5,2016,09,26
226,Interior design issues and somewhat tired service,"We spent two nights in the hotel. It has its idiosyncrasies.

To meet a legal requirement, we were told, standard rooms are fitted for disabled guests. This is laudable. It must be very disagreeable indeed for disabled guests to stay in hotel rooms in which no provision is made for their needs. But there are some disadvantages for differently abled room users.

I am a short man. The hand basin in the bathroom came up to my lower thigh. Perfect for a wheelchair user, but extremely difficult for many other people. There were no hooks on the walls to hang up dressing gowns or used towels. There were no shelves or holders for soap or shampoo in the unenclosed shower area. Don't get me wrong: Disabled people are entitled to equality. But the bathroom isn't completely equal.

The hotel has the feel of resting on its laurels: There was no laundry bag in our room. When we requested one, it came up promptly - but without a pre-printed laundry list. The room service was tastefully presented on a table covered by napery, but only one of the extension flaps opened, which made sitting at the table a mission. 

And then there was the breakfast... For guests wanting a cooked breakfast, the hotel persists in offering a menu - unlike many others in its class which put the hot food out in bain-maries. This seems very pleasant, until you discover that two poached eggs and two slices of blood sausage can take half an hour to emerge. A modest bowl of porridge took more than twenty minutes. I never discovered how to toast a piece of bread for myself in the dining room.

We found the hotel convenient for the city centre and (with the exception of our bathroom) well-appointed. We received good service from Aiden in the dining room and Paul and Stephen at the concierge's desk.",3,2016,09,26
226,Good,Lovely hotel . Left little buns on a happy birthday plate in the room for my mums 70th . Bathrobes and slippers and white company toiletries made it xtra special . Pre theatre dinner was excellent as was breakfast . A little expensive for regular visits as I'm a single mum but well worth it if u can afford it.  ,5,2016,09,25
226,Great weekend stay at the Fitzwilliam Hotel,"We stayed at the Fitzwilliam for a weekend break in Belfast and had a lovely stay.  Room was clean and spacious and the bed was really comfortable.  Staff were extremely helpful and friendly and the hotel decor and facilities overall were excellent.
The location is very central and the Opera House is right next door.  Breakfast was great and we also had a lovely lunch from the bar menu and a lovely dinner in the Restaurant.",5,2016,09,25
226,Beautiful remodel,"This property has recently been remodeled. All of the guest rooms and public area has a brand new modern look.  It is a great location in the city center of Belfast with plenty of car parks nearby. 
I was surprised to see how dark the rooms were after the remodel, especially the bathrooms. Lighting for shaving was dismal.
The breakfast service was extremely slow, if you order a cooked breakfast be prepared to spend a half hour for you food. The staff was either very tired or disinterested in serving breakfast.

A very nice property for the money. You will enjoy your stay here if you don‚Äôt mind a long, slow breakfast.",4,2016,09,25
226,Well done Fitzwilliam,"Everything about this hotel just worked for me. It's location in central Belfast is perfect. Literally beside two of Belfast's landmarks, The Grand Opera House and The Crown Bar - the latter basking in its original name, Crown Liquor Saloon. 
The concierge and reception combined to give a very warm welcome on arrival and I was given an excellent room on the 7th floor. So good was it that I worried I might have been mistakenly upgraded but, saying nothing just in case, a colleague later confirmed it was a standard room. 
I didn't have dinner there but enjoyed a late lunch in the bar and three excellent breakfast which were included in the price. But it was the friendliness of all the staff which made my stay there so very enjoyable. 
A notice in the foyer declared they were beginning a refurbishment programme. Hope they are not trying to 'rewrite a hit song' because I think they already have it just right. Well done Fitzwilliam. ",5,2016,09,23
226,Great stay at the Fitzwilliam,"We stayed at the Fitzwilliam for one night for a weekend trip. The location is great, there is a Starbucks on the other side of the road, a tesco and restaurants around the hotel. We were allowed to check in earlier, which was handy. The room was clean and spacious, bed was comfortable. Tip: it might be a good idea to bring your ear plugs or ask for some at the reception if you're a light sleeper, as there is a clock tower that goes off on every hour. Overall, would definitely return next time.",5,2016,09,21
226,One night stay,"Stayed for one night while in Belfast for business. Check in was friendly and efficient. Corridors are a little dark. Room was good, bed large. Would say 9 pillows/cushions on the bed it a bit much and the tub is not full size although the shower is huge. My main gripe was that the light in the wardrobe did not shut off, so when in bed there was a constant light from the cupboard, which was an irritation. I was also quite warm as the duvet was very heavy and thick meaning I needed the air con on but all workable.",4,2016,09,21
226,weekend stay,"staff were so helpful, nothing was a problem. rooms were big clean the bed was so big and spacious 3 could fit in it.. very happy. only bad thing was parking the car. 18 pound a day is a bit much to ask it should be part of the hotel and customers right to park if they are staying in the hotel for free. its unfair of the hotel to do this. the nice staff made up for the loss in parking..",5,2016,09,21
226,High end hotel in centre of Belfast,"Only stayed here as my business booked the accommodation for me. Excellent quality rooms, although the view wasn't nice at all (although this is to be expected in a city like Belfast!) Stayed for 1 night, no problems.",3,2016,09,20
226,Excellent hotel but the restaurant robbed the 5th stars,"The hotel was overall phenomenal. The staff greeted us very warmly and the concierge was beyond exceptional. The room was spacious, comfortable, and very clean. We had a great view from the room and felt right at home. The bathroom was clean and had a wonderful shower and bath. I highly recommend the room service. The food was excellent and the staff brining it up were fantastic. 
The restaurant on the first floor though, I would avoid completely. That is the only reason this review is not 5 star. We were dressed relaxed and casual since the stay was part of a vacation trip to Ireland. Big mistake. When we stepped off the elevator, the man at the stand ask if we had a reservation. We said no and was about to say because we were staying at the hotel, but he just said ""I need to check availability"" and walked off. There were less the 10 people total in the restaurant, so unless about 50 couples were expected to show up in the next 5 minutes, availability was not an issue. I guess since we were not in our Sunday best, he did not think we were worth the bother. Finally someone else came back to the stand and he asked if we were staying at the hotel. When we said yes we were seated immediately, but on the far side of the restaurant away from everyone else. I have never seen a restaurant with more waiters and waitresses completely uninterested in the customers. We were ingnored most of the time and had to ask just to be given water. The food unfortunately was not much better than the staff. The hummus with the bread starter was absolutely flavorless. The beef filet my husband ordered was over cooked and bland, and the salad side was more for looks. No dressing was on it and was not even offered. I ordered the halibut and expected to receive a nice square of meaty, flaky fish. Rather than the main meat of the fish that is normally served, I received the thin outer pieces of the fish. The reason you don't serve the thin edges is because it dries out easily and is harder to debone. Mine was dry and had bones still in it. I guess I was not worth the best cut of the fish since I was not wearing expensive jewelry. The only good part of the meal was the chips which is sad considering the food was supposed to be fine dining. We finally talked a server into giving us the bill and left immediately. Maybe if you are dressed like a millionaire and order the most expensive wine, you will get a better experience, but I would just suggest skipping this restaurant and heading down  the street to Flame. The food was amazing there and the service was phenomenal. Hotel staff and rooms 5 out of 5, the first floor restaurant less than 1 out of 5.",4,2016,09,18
226,Great hotel let down by food/drink service,"Reception staff were excellent (especially Ashleigh, who was very helpful and friendly) and check in was quick and easy.  The room was of a high standard and tastefully decorated.  The catering let it down:
1) Breakfast: on a quiet Monday morning was reasonable, but on a busy Tuesday morning the service was slow, the staff seemed rushed and the quality of food was much worse than the previous day.
2) Bar: we were ushered to seats rather than being able to get served at the bar, and they were then slow to come and take an order, to prepare and bring the drinks and to get the bill.  The barman was busy doing other tasks such as cleaning glasses before starting to prepare our drinks, I would expect jobs like that to wait when there are customers waiting for a drink.  It was very quiet (< 10 customers) and there were two members of staff, so the service was disappointing.

The hotel as a whole I would recommend, based on the location (easy to walk to the central shopping area and many attractions), rooms and staff but I would eat and drink elsewhere.",4,2016,09,17
226,Nice place with an asterisk.,"this is a nice hotel, however i had a bad experience the first night.  i was awakened in the night by what i thought was thunder.  But the it continued all night & i did not get much restful sleep.  When i inquired at the desk the next morning, they told me that the building across the alley has a generator that makes the noise & they could not control it.  They did move me to a better upgraded room the 2nd night so that helped in my overall experence at the hotel.",3,2016,09,17
226,Room 702 has panoramic views...,"Kits starts day by asking ""Would it not have been sensible to book a hotel with parking?""  but she settles down as soon as we reach Cairnryan and ease ourselves into the Stena lounge with a glass of rose, bound for Belfast.  This was to be a day of unexpected pleasures.  We had booked a deluxe room at the Fitzwilliam Hotel and found ourselves high up on the seventh floor (room 702) in a gorgeous suite with floor to ceiling windows on two sides giving panoramic views over the city.  Super bathroom too.  We enjoyed a nice glass of SB in their rather attractive cocktail bar before going to dinner at The Lantern which is currently rated highly by TripAdvisor reviewers (Number 7 of 773 Belfast restaurants) and is only a stones throw from the hotel (the concierge will show you where).   Hot tip - Park at McAusland‚Äôs Secure Parking just across the road for only 15 pounds per 24 hours (12 pounds if you get the hotel to stamp your ticket)",4,2016,09,17
226,What a fabulous hotel! ,"Can't find fault with this hotel at all. The service is fabulous and even the standard rooms are spacious, well furnished and comfortable. All the staff we encountered were friendly, warm and helpful. I forgot the charger for my kindle and they loaned me one. The concierge brought our car back, put our luggage in the trunk and put bottles of water in the car. He then checked to see if we needed directions. Thank you guys. We will be back! ",5,2016,09,17
226,A Fabulous diversion,"We stayed here when our flight was delayed at Belfast airport - what a fortunate diversion. The hotel is modern and stylish with a superb restaurant and the bedrooms (even the standard one we stayed in) was first class with plenty of space and a funky, modern bathroom. The staff were brilliant and very friendly and I look forward to returning.",5,2016,09,16
226,Friendly staff and great room,"Everyone we met at the hotel was friendly and helpful.  Our room was lovely: Big enough with a stunning bathroom.  Drinks in the bar are a great way to start an evening.
One recommendation I have is to light the hallways a bit more.  The Fitzwilliam is located within walking distance to several nice restaurants.",5,2016,09,14
226,Great hotel; great location,"My colleagues and I stayed at the Fitzwilliam in July 2016 on a work trip to Belfast and Co. Antrim. The hotel had been recommended to us by our other colleagues and I am happy to say that they were correct in what they recommended.

The hotel is very modern and has all of the modern amenities that would be essential for a class hotel. The bar on the ground floor was very cosy and warm with the bar food being very good. All of the bar staff were both friendly and approachable.

Breakfast was exactly what was required and had all of the choices you would like to have offered. All of the hot food was very warm and all food was fresh.

The hotel room, while not the biggest, was of a good size and quiet. The WIFI access was great without any interruptions. 

I will definitely be staying in the Fitzwilliam for any future visits to Belfast.",4,2016,09,12
226,Modern chic,"This is a stunning hotel...gorgeous lobby, super friendly receptionists, great location. 

Now, for the room-wow! The furniture was firm & comfy, the view (stayed on 7th floor) was brilliant, the bathroom was amazing with great water pressure...French press coffee, plush gowns, bedroom slippers, CD player with speakers...I could go on & on...I've been traveling around Ireland for 10 days and this is my favorite hotel so far...

Only negative was breakfast...not great (all hot food needs to be ordered & is prepared fresh so it takes a long time...they messed up my omelette...if you want any sides like sausage, make sure you order that as well...I assumed it would come with my omelette but that is not the case).

Overall, I give this hotel 2 thumbs up!",5,2016,09,11
226,"Well-Appointed Rooms, Great Location and EXCELLENT STAFF","We stayed here two nights before heading to Donegal and were extremely pleased with every aspect of our stay.  Very close to the bus station (easy transit from airport), and lots of major attractions.  We booked a huge junior suite with contemporary furnishings including a wonderfully comfortable bed, sofa, huge flatscreen, excellent storage, and an insanely large spa-worthy bathtub and shower.  Luxurious linens, towels and toiletries.  Fantastic view of Belfast from the huge floor-ceiling windows. Upon recommendation from the staff, we enjoyed some wonderful local musicians playing traditional music at Robinsons,back bar just across the street. Breakfast was excellent with numerous choices for everyone in the lovely contemporary dining room.  Kudos to the exceptionally friendly and well-trained staff who went out of their way to welcome us and facilitate our most enjoyable visit to Belfast---highly recommend this great hotel.",4,2016,09,10
226,Very pleasant,We were immediately greeted by a bellman upon arrival. Our check in was flawless and very hospitable and we were upgraded to a superior room.  We found the room to be spacious and comfortable and lovely.  Staying here only added to a pleasant stay in Belfast and the hotel was in easy walking distance of our buses. ,5,2016,09,10
226,Fantastic,I had booked this to celebrate our 25th wedding anniversary.  Was so worth it! The room was fab 7th floor deluxe room. Looking onto Great Victoria Street and down Howard Street. Bathroom amazing lovely shower and bath. Bathrobes supplied. Breakfast was great. Wd definitely return although prob could not afford to stay in same room but wd love to!!,5,2016,09,10
226,Best location and staff service,"Right in the heart of city center with 5 minutes waking to shopping and restaurants.
Bus station near by subway at the door step, anything you need is right around the hotel. Only 10 minutes taxi about 10 pounds cost to the city airport.",5,2016,09,08
226,Beautiful Hotel,"This hotel is right around the corner from the coach station, next door to the Grand Opera House Theatre, so it was so handy for us.

It is a 5 star hotel and it is easy to see why.  The hotel is gorgeous and the staff are so friendly and helpful.  We had to ask for directions quite a few times but they never got impatient and they went out of their way to assist us.

We didn't have food in the restaurant, but we had cocktails and although they hadn't mentioned 'Mocktails - non-alcoholic cocktails' on the menu, there was no hassle at all when I asked for some to be prepared.  They even used a fancy martini glass :)

The bedroom was stunning - we had a twin room and the beds were very roomy.  There were a few different types of pillows (feather, hypoallergenic, etc) and there was a little information booklet stating that if we wanted different types of pillow, they would accommodate us.

There was also a sofa in our room, which was handy for packing to go home!!

The bathroom was lush - massive rain shower AND a bath.  and, the best thing of the whole lot, in my opinion, is that the little toiletries were Cruelty-Free and Vegan.  You *almost never* get both options but this really made me smile.  Most hotels ask that you let them know if you need new towels each day, but to have such an ethical stance as to provide cruelty-free toiletries that had 'no animal derivitives' was just amazing :)  leaping bunny symbol and all.

10 out of 10 for this amazing hotel.  Can't wait to book my next stay :)",5,2016,09,07
226,"Modern, Clean, friendly = perfect","Great hotel, staff are lovely, rooms are spotless, hotel is very new and modern, well it givens that impression, restaurant is on the first floor which is nice, gives guest more private VIP feel, 
We where going to stay in Ten square, so we called in for one drink, didn't like it at all, staff where not very good for friendly, 

Very glad we picked the Fitzwilliams,

Will Stay again.",5,2016,09,07
226,Perfect - just about,"This is an excellent hotel located at the Southern end of Belfast city centre. With lots of standard hotels around, I really felt that this was almost a boutique hotel - polite and friendly staff, impeccably clean room, no noise from the street, and all possible amenities a business traveller may need. The design is also great, with restrained colours but lots of mirrors, including on the outside of the doors. It is also located very conveniently - just a couple of blocks away from the main sites and attractions. ...and of course they have a concierge.

The only 'fly in the ointment' was that they took the libery of adding a charity donation to my bill - really, regardless of the cause, this is unbecoming of a hotel of this level, it's more of a provenance of a cheap restaurant chain.

Other than that, a great place!",5,2016,09,06
226,Lovely modern and quiet,"Very much enjoyed our 3 night visit to this hotel.  Easy to find and welcoming.Great for the city centre.  Two lifts for this size of hotel is a bit tight at busy times.  Never yet found the stairs.  Breakfast was great as was dinner in the restaurant and also the bar!  Concierge were all amazing and the chamber maids.  Reception staff also very good but we did have one issue.  Young man serving in the bar on Sunday evening (3rd Sept) was especially efficient in his job, thank you so much for helping where the receptionist didnt!",4,2016,09,05
226,Swanky hotel,"This hotel exceeded my expectations. Staff was very helpful with all of our needs. They even let us hang out in the lobby, even after check out because we were waiting for our laundry to get delivered. Bar staff were funny and entertaining and the concierge men were very cute! Totes hubba hubba!",5,2016,09,05
226,Beautiful hotel and a fantastic location.,"We stayed at the Fitzwilliam Hotel over a weekend, while in Belfast for a wedding. The hotel was beautiful, very well equipped, comfortable, quiet, and well located. A few minutes walk from Donegall Square, and within walking distance of most of the city's attractions. It is also next door to the bus station where the airport express bus arrives at/leaves from.

The staff were very welcoming and always eager to help. They were able to look after our luggage until 7pm after we had checked out, which was greatly appreciated as it meant we were able to fully enjoy our last day in Belfast.

I would not hesitate to stay again if I am in Belfast, nor to recommend the Fitzwilliam to anyone visiting Belfast.",5,2016,09,05
226,The Fitzwilliam Hotel in Belfast,"Very nice hotel in a great location. Walking distance to shopping, sightseeing, etc. You would want to take a cab to the Titanic Museum if you plan to go there. Staff is very nice and extremely accommodating. Rooms are very nice and comfortable. I don't think there is really any sort of ""view"" to request.",5,2016,09,02
226,Beautiful smart hotel,"I stayed here for two night with my boyfriend and another couple. We were visiting Belfast for a concert. The hotel staff were super friendly and welcoming. Everything was simple. The rooms were of lovely design and the bed was massive and super comfy. The bathroom had both bath and separate shower. We paid ¬£260 for two nights, normally this is too much for me but it was worth it. 

We had a quick look in the gym which was very small. 

Mini bar is very expensive but the bar downstairs has a wide range of food and cocktails. ",5,2016,09,02
226,"Not the cheapest, but not pricey. Great for a romantic getaway","We were recommended to Fitzwilliam hotel by a Belfast friend. He said that it was a boutique type hotel and right in the heart of Belfast. He said it was great value and he was absolutely right. We were there for a wedding and stayed for two nights and had a fantastic time. The bedroomwas spacious and luxurious with the radio playing classic FM as we entered, good facilities and very clean with modern styling.

Reception could not have been more helpful. Breakfast was superb and the bar very good. I can very much recommend the local IPA!

We will be going to Belfast again as we find people incredibly warm, welcoming and the city vibrant and attractive with great restaurants bars and a real vibe.",4,2016,08,30
226,Lovely ,"Really enjoyed my stay at the Fitzwilliam. I arrived late and not very well so my room was a welcome sight. Comfortable bed, even though it was more firm than I generally like, I still had an excellent sleep each night. Staff are extremely lovely and very friendly. My only very small qualm is that the water pressure in the shower is dreadful. Perfect location to walk all around Belfast.",4,2016,08,30
226,Disappointed ,"Bar ran out of liqueur so couldn't make my cocktail
Kitchen ran out of nuts and soy milk for breakfast... Had obviously run out the day before and not replaced
Shower not very powerful and shower tray very slippy... My husband fell
Electricity went off in our room in the morning and staff couldn't get back on so we had to shower in the dark 
They did take ¬£25 off the bill for this but instead of coming to talk and apologise to us, the manager took the receptionist aside and told her what to do! ",2,2016,08,30
226,Wonderfully Smart Hotel,"Only one night, but that was enough to enjoy the opulence of their Executive King.
By far one of the comfiest beds I have ever slept in. Good too see money is being well spent to ensure a fantastic nights sleep. The room service was enjoyable and the minibar drinks well priced. The room decor was smart, with dark wooden panelled walls, mirrors and also fabric wall coverings. The DAB stereo in the room is a nice touch (which we had cranked up till the early hours.! Sorry !) Communication with the hotel in regards to a valet parking space was excellent. And both receptionists and concierge were very helpful. I will look forward to my next stay.",5,2016,08,30
226,The fitzwilliam ,"Stayed here for two nights in August. The corner suite was amazing. Loads of tea, coffee biscuits. Toiletries were lovely, and you also had a complimentary umbrella but luckily we didn't use it as weather was nice and sunny. The staff go out of their way to help you. The breakfast selection was huge, a full English and I even got extra white pudding (can't remember the name) cereals, fruits smoothies toast etc. When we were checking out they also let us keep our luggage there as we had a few hours left until the ferry. I will definitely stay here again as you are pretty central for shopping and its next too the old opera house.",5,2016,08,29
226,Great Location and Nice Rooms,"We arrived with our tour at the hotel in the afternoon and by the time we returned our luggage was in our rooms. The lobby is nice and warm with some nice furniture and fireplace.
Their restaurant is on the 1st floor, where we arrived at 7 pm for supper. Our orders were taken quickly from the pre-set menu and then unfortunately we waited. No bread or rolls were offered while we waited. Our first course finally arrived at 7:50 pm. A little too long!! Our mains came next and then dessert and coffee. We were mostly out by 9:00 pm. Most of us agreed that the starters were very good but the mains, the chicken (dry), lamb rump (was a bit overcooked). The ravioli was okay. The desserts were good. 
Our breakfasts the next morning was much improved, offering a very good variety of hot and cold foods.
Our room was a bit on the small size, 2 single beds, a bathtub as well as a huge  shower. We had only one complaint. Our bathroom was giving off a terrible smell. I reported the problem to the front desk but the maintenance staff were off for the day. They put a room deodorizer into our main room as there wasn't a plug in the bathroom. As well, our shower door didn't close properly and we ended up with a flood on the floor.
The management did apologize for the inconveniences and sent us up a small fruit platter.
Their location is excellent, every central to all the shops and historical sites.",3,2016,08,29
226,Good first impressions let down by failed promises,"Arrived at the Fitzwiliam Hotel for a few post-dinner drinks to finish off an evening. After having been very pleasantly informed we would have to drink in the lobby (due to the presence of a child in the party) we were then seated and handed the drinks menu, with the waiter promising to return to take our order in a few minutes. 15 minutes later, and with an ever increasing thirst, I went into the bar area to order some refreshments in person. This time, after taking the order, the barman offered to bring the drinks to our table in the lobby - very pleasantly again I must add. A further 20 minute wait ensued, and still no sign of a glass or two. This time there was to be no second chance and we gave up and left the Hotel to continue our evening elsewhere. In summary, full marks for pleasantries but zero for execution...oh, and the lightbulb was never replaced either, but that's another story!",2,2016,08,29
226,Special day,"My daughters wedding was amazing- the whole day was just perfect and the staff here looked after us so attentively.
The food was superb.
Planning a wedding is stressful and it needs very careful attention to detail and the ladies who helped us the night before and again on the day were very patient with us
So thanks to everyone at the Fitzwilliam for making the day so wonderful ",5,2016,08,29
226,Lovely hotel in an excellent location ,"We stayed in an executive double room which was very comfortable. Reception staff were friendly and efficient. 
Location means you can walk into town very easily and there are plenty of restaurants and bars nearby of different styles and price ranges. 
",4,2016,08,27
226,Great Service,"The location was very convenient. The service was great across check in, concierge, breakfast, etc. Stephen, the concierge,  was very helpful with arranging for a private tour for us, and setting us up for our short visit. The rooms were clean and comfortable beds. Breakfast was really tasty and filling too, and they had a vegetarian option other than porridge! My only complaint is the hallways are too dark.",5,2016,08,25
226,Super cool!,"The Fitzwilliam is very cool-looking, elegantly decorated, with a certain New York cool feel. We had a fabulous room( corner room, ceiling to floor windows, overlooking the busy streets, entertaining but very quiet). It was spacious, airy but cosy, the bathroom in its black art deco scheme was a dream, the toiletries were very generous, the bed was very comfortable. It is perfectly located in the centre of town, near the iconic and beautiful Crown pub. The staff were charming. We didn't want to leave!!! 
",5,2016,08,25
226,Bistro Lunch was great!,Stayed in the Fitzwilliam in August and really enjoyed our stay. Staff excellent and Sunday Bistro Lunch was delicious. Room was comfortable and had a great nights sleep with no noise which was brilliant for city centre hotel. Great start to a city break with valet parking and so convenient for City Centre. Great service and overall a pleasant stay.,4,2016,08,24
226,Great Location for Walking,An upscale hotel in the center of town.  Lots of shopping and restaurants within walking distance.  The staff is cordial and the room is clean and well appointed.  Our GPS suggested an illegal right turn... but after going around the block we finally managed to pull into the 1-stall reserved for valet parking.  Suggest an early call to the valet when you want your car - seems to take longer than expected.,4,2016,08,24
226,"Nice Hotel, comfortable and convenient.","I stayed here for two nights with my husband in August 2016.
Overall we had a pleasant trip and would return to the Fitzwilliam. It was our first stay there.
We had booked the valet parking which was useful and reasonably priced; my only quibble was in having to exit our vehicle to go into the hotel to find the concierge and ask for assistance. There was not a porter in sight when we arrived, however the concierge was very helpful, immediately arranging for help and assisting us with our luggage.
Our room was lovely, it had a comfortable bed, ample room and a good sized ensuite with a bath, wc, basin and shower enclosure. 
Breakfast was good, with us opting for the cooked breakfast...I had eggs benedict and my husband had the kippers. Neither were particularly big portions, but what we had was delicious, there was plenty of food available with the continental buffet; cheeses, fruit, breads, yoghurt etc etc. We did not go hungry. 
The service was satisfactory if not quite outstanding. 
In all we found the hotel very convenient and pleasant to stay in. 
I would happily visit the Fitzwilliam again. ",4,2016,08,24
226,Nice Hotel,"Nice hotel with great staff and average rooms.  The rooms were quiet, clean but nothing grand.  Hotel is located 3 minute walk to bus station (express bus to Portrush and Giants Causeway), 20 minute walk to train station, 5 minute walk to city bus and 10 minute walk to main pub district.  Famous Crown Liquor Saloon is 2 minutes walk and basically across the street.  20 minute drive to airport, $35 (pound) No complaints with my stay.",3,2016,08,23
226,Will stay again,"Well. Great cocktail bar , with great bar food all tucked away behind reception.
The restaurant in the first floor is a bit of understated poshness , with more delightful fare.
Breakfast is brill, with squeezed orange juice.
Rooms are a fair size but could be fresher . Bathrooms nice with loads of space.
Great vantage point to see what's going on in the city from the room views.
",5,2016,08,23
226,Couldn't have asked for more ......,"A very modern, stylish hotel in a perfect City Centre location with professional friendly staff. 
We arrived mid morning to find the room available which was a god send given the time.  The rooms are stylish and practical, large bed with (for us)  a slightly too soft mattress and  soft pillows.  Excellent bathroom with walk-in separate shower, and bath with shower attachment - amenities are of a good quality but due to soft water in the area it does take a long while to rid yourself of the soapy feeling. (not the hotels fault of course) 
Breakfast (we had booked Room only) was offered to us on check-in as a pre-pay option of ¬£10.00 per person which is excellent value given the choice on offer.
Our only gripe was when ironing a shirt for the evening the iron, at a hot temperature, left a nasty mark on the front of the shirt due to badly stained hot-plate.  The hotel did their very best to have it removed but sadly failed, however we were handled professionally during our complaint and offered recompense.  Thank you James & Victoria of Front Office Management team.  
TIP TO SELF & OTHER TRAVELLERS: always check the hot-plate of the Iron before using it!!
Other staff worthy note are Stephen in Concierge - very helpful and informative, Thank you for all your help and advice.  Ashleigh and Michelle at Front Desk - always ready with a smile.
We cannot recommend this hotel enough if you visit Belfast.",5,2016,08,23
226,Lovely stay,"We had a lovely 3 night stay.  The staff were super-helpful and friendly with all the amenities provided.  The continental breakfast has many options, and they hot menu provides delicious offerings.  My personal favorite was the Smoked Salmon Eggs Benedict.  Easy walking distance to shopping and dining.",5,2016,08,23
226,"Great hotel, great staff, great location...","Who could ask for anything more.  Did a one night stay here on our way to Scotland.  Hotel is brand new (or feels that way), and convenient.  Pay parking is available across the street in a secure lot.  Front desk staff, both at check in and check out were GREAT!  Friendly recommendations and could share in a laugh.  Location of the hotel is central and easy walking district to a lot of the attractions that Belfast has to offer.",5,2016,08,23
226,Not a FIVE STAR Hotel,"The hotel was beautiful however the concierge and desk staff were rude and provided zero help. For example.... We needed a power adapter to fit the 3 prong outlets. They told us to ""go purchase one"" at the drugstore down the block, because the hotel was out of the them (for 4 days). We purchased the adapter, still didn't work. Called down to the desk...sorry don't know what to tell you. Only after my wife said ""this is not acceptable"" did we get one concierge's to come to the room (with a bad attitude). 

Every (and I mean every) time I went to the lobby to ask for assistance with a dinning or entertainment, the concierge's were locked in deep conversation and I was clearly bothering them..

This isn't the type of treatment I'd expect from a ""FIVE STAR"" Hotel. Even if I am an American who is spending cash in your hotel",2,2016,08,23
226,perfect city hotel,We did stay for a week during our North Ireland tour at this Hotel and can only report that the Hotel is great. The location and the friendly staff together with nice rooms and a good breakfast make this Hotel one of the better City Hotels in Ireland.,4,2016,08,23
226,Beautiful Hotel,"Our stay was during July, the hotel is in a perfect location in the heart of Belfast. It is right beside a tescos, and lots of bars and restaurants for a good night out. If you are going out for a meal I would recomment either Fratelli or The Red Panda, which are both next door to eachother on the same road as the hotel, or just eat in, the hotel food was amazing! The room was very clean, everything was gorgeous but my favourite was the bathroom! You also got a robe and slippers in the cupboard and they supplied shampoos, conditioners, shower gel etc.. and they had matches and candles for you to light. There was a radio and a flatscreen tv, and they supplied tea, coffee, hot chocolate and water, the only bad thing was that the fridge was locked until you phoned the reception to tell them to open it, and whatever you took from the fridge got extra added on to your bill. The view was beautiful, but the windows in our room didnt open so we had to use the air conditioning. There wasnt a pool or anything, and if there had of been a pool I would of rated the hotel Excellent.",4,2016,08,23
226,Fab hotel,Gorgeous rooms with great decor and space. Spotlessly clean in every way. Fabulous location in the centre of Belfast. Main lobby and bar are lovely with plush furnishings. Would certainly highly recommend this hotel.,5,2016,08,22
226,Fantastic hotel,"So modern, rooms have such a funky design . We had a room with a view of the mountains and it was just fab .. staff were great and really helpful the hotel is in a great location and we had a great time",5,2016,08,21
226,Brilliant customer care,My son and his partner stayed here last night and was booked in for dinner but unfortunately he was unwell and could not make it to the restaurant...however the staff went all out to make sure he was looked after....the meal was brought to the room with a heater to keep it warm and left bottled water to ensure he was ok plus the staff member said if they needed anything to contact her...did not get her name but thank you...I stay here a lot and it just confirms what a wonderful hotel this is...please pass on my sincere thanks to the wonderful member of staff who was so good,5,2016,08,21
226,All ok ,"Staff great. Hotel lovely. But missing a few obvious points for the very high price we paid. Eg: No water in the room. Shower was a trickle. 

Still it was lovely. Beautiful and clean room in lovely modern hotel and very central. I'd go back. If I was feeling flush!!

226,Amazing Hotel!,"My husband and I stayed in the Fitzwilliam Hotel for our anniversary and it was fantastic from start to finish. The moment we stepped into the Hotel we were greeted by friendly staff. Check in was quick and the front desk staff were very informative.
The bar has the best cocktails and the servers were very attentive!
The restaurant food was delicious and we would highly recommend it.
The room was a great size with a very comfortable bed. 
Overall a very enjoyable stay at the Fitzwilliam made more special by the friendly staff. We will definitely be returning.",5,2016,08,20
226,Great stay. Perfect location,Stayed here for 2 nights and found it to be very convenient to travel around the city. Its only 2 minutes from city hall and numerous shopping streets. The staff are all very friendly and helpful.  Reakfast each morning was tasty and there were plenty of options. Next time i isit belfast i will definitely stay here again,5,2016,08,17
226,Vacation stay,"Beautiful well kept hotel, food at the hotel restaurant and bar was really good, continental breakfast was outstanding and the service was so quick.  Our room was very nice, the hotel is located downtown and across from some really good pubs like the Crown Pub which is a landmark.  If you haven't tried Guinness, now is the time to do so, it's delicious.  The people who work in this hotel are so helpful and friendly.",5,2016,08,17
226,Special,"What a jewel. Our first trip north and we selected this hotel from other people's recommendations and boy were they right a great hotel with great staff. To all thank you for making our visit to the North so ""Special"" from check in to leaving so simple so professional. To the concierge thank you for arranging the black cab tour. ",5,2016,08,17
226,Perfect,"This was booked for us by our travel agent.  We could not have been happier. The staff was beyond friendly and seemed to care about all needs.  We must have asked the bell staff a million questions about attractions, restaurants and golf!  We were given a corner room with a fabulous view.  The hotel is convenient for walking just about everywhere!",5,2016,08,17
226,Elegant and comfortable,"The hotel is very central. We booked a delux room on the third floor and we loved the room in spite of a few surprising flaws. These rooms are fabulously appointed on the corner of the building so that guests have windows on two sides looking directly out at the lovely Assembly building and onto the street. The room was very spacious and designed in such a way that the doors to the bathroom could be folded away leaving one big sleeping, working (?), living space. The room was beautiful it. The bed was a very comfortable King (perhaps extra King). We enjoyed the nespresso machine and regular tea/coffee facility. Unfortunately, we didn't order from the restaurant. The food seemed great and was reasonably priced. 

The bathroom was disappointing, although nicely designed and tiled; one small wash handbasin and a tiny shelf above it. Barely enough space for one, certainly not for two guests sharing (and we are not heavy travelers). The bath was a standard size and somehow seemed too ordinary for the room. The plug could not be released and we had to call hotel staff to unplug it and let out the dirty bath water. The shower tap was exceptionally tight, so that my partner had to turn the shower on for me!! 
Staff were friendly and helpful. We loved the foyer decor. We found the bar disappointing and not particularly cosy although food and drinks were good. 

Breakfast was a mix of limited buffet and √† la carte. Everything ordered was excellently prepared and delivered to the table in a very positive and helpful manner. Breakfast staff were all exceptionally friendly. 

We would return but would probably not stay in a delux room, as the quality just missed the mark for us in relation to the price. ",4,2016,08,17
226,wedding anniversary weekend,"First time to stay in a suite in the Fitz, extremely nice in every respect probably because of the aircon, other rooms are too warm. Have never been a fan of the bar so took drinks to room which was beautiful and very comfortable",4,2016,08,17
226,Delightful psychedelic stay,"Attention to detail on arrival was exemplary from the reception and concierge. We had booked valet parking, and this was smooth too. Directed to rooms on 3rd floor- 306 and 307 for children-king bed and twin. Both rooms generously decorated with black and gold colors, and mirrors galore. Mirrors on the doors and walls, which gave it a more spacious and lighter feel. Marble or marble-like furnishings and traditional velvet old school gentlemanly couch with multiple buttons- nice touch. Spacious bathroom with walk in shower and tub in the king room, but no walk in shower in the twin. Safe, bath robes and slippers provided.

Food and drink
We had our evening meal in the bar on the ground floor as the restaurant was full. To be honest, this was better than the restaurant. Lovely food and cocktails for the wife. Can't complain about the food, however such an establishment needs to be fine dining to make it whole. Breakfast was standard with fresh orange juice- lovely.

Location is ideal for exploring Belfast. Remember to book valet parking. Overall, quite an impressive hotel and would recommend it. Bring on the fine dining.",4,2016,08,15
226,Lovely hotel!,"Excellent hotel with lovely rooms, great service and staff and delicious breakfast.   Stayed for 4 days and a wonderful experience.  
Central to everything and beautiful inside and out in addition to modern.",5,2016,08,15
226,Conveniently Superb,"Recently stayed four nights in this city centre hotel with wife and friends.  Could not be more convenient for the centre of the city, bus station and bars and restaurants.
The welcome we received from the staff was great. So friendly and helpful.  Was given a map where the places we were interested in were marked on for us.
The rooms were spacious with large settee, giant bed and bathroom with four piece suite.  Lovely decor except the awful mirrors which were intentionally 'browned' but hard to use.  The bathroom mirrors were better but lighting could have been a little brighter.
Plenty of teas, coffees, water etc. provided.
Breakfast great especially the full Irish and summer fruits, granola with nuts etc.
Parking quite expensive but other options nearby.
Price a little high - I did not realise that the Saturday was ¬£40 more than other nights although when I looked back on my confirmation, it was there.
Only real downside was the two pairs of slippers which were in the wardrobe were removed whilst we were there.  I think a wardrobe should be private when the room is being occupied.
Will return if in Belfast again.",5,2016,08,14
226,Hen party cocktail making,"Hen party of 16. 
Location was fab, lovely view over the city. 
¬£30 to make 2 cocktails.
We requested buying an additional bottle to allow us to make another drink or 2 each, this was declined. 
Some little appetisers were provided which looked cute but burgers were a bit too pink for me!",3,2016,08,14
226,FitzWelcome,"We were made to feel welcomed from our first steps through the front door. Good value for ¬£150 per night. Great cocktails, huge comfy beds, friendly, chatty staff, and within walking distance to most Belfast sights.",5,2016,08,14
226,Weekend in Belfast ,"We stayed in the beautiful  Fitzwilliam Hotel . Valet parking, staff very friendly and concierge was excellent. Rooms have all been redecorated this year and are lovely and very well equipped, flat screen TV, music system, cafeti√®re coffee, iron, hairdryer, and comfortable sofa. Great breakfast also, we will definitely return.",5,2016,08,14
226,Does exactly what it says on the tin,"Stayed four nights with friends the building is modern and stylish.
The rooms were very well appointed and fashionably decorated. The hotel is all situated with just a short walk to  the centre.
Breakfasts were upscale buffet style but excellent choice and quality
Cooked orders were waiter served with excellent service.
Would defiantly stay again.",5,2016,08,14
226,Style and Comfort !!!,"We have just had a wonderful nights stay in this lovely Hotel right in the centre of Belfast . We had the Thank Fitz its Friday offer and truly enjoyed it . Staff were welcoming and helpful ,the bar and restaurant staff were first class.  The proximity of the hotel to other places to see in Belfast was excellent.  Our executive room  had all we ever needed....and was beautifully decorated ...would recommend ...",5,2016,08,13
226,Girls night out,"Great hotel, brilliant city centre location.
Very friendly front desk staff, the hotel bar staff were also efficient and friendly. And very helpful.
Room equipped well there was even a DVD player and umbrella for the wet summer days.
The opera house is right next door, no need for taxis.
Highly recommended!",5,2016,08,13
226,HIGHLY RECOMMENDED HOTEL,"My wife and I stayed at this hotel in April of 2016.   Our stay was a very pleasant experience with the service being efficient, helpful and friendly.   

Our room was spacious and clean.   The ensuite was excellent and included a good range of toiletries.   Housekeeping sevices were the equal some of the best hotels that we have stayed at. 

Of special mention would by the concierge services - top quality.   These guys had our luggage delivered to our room or car with speed.   The also spent much of their time parking or retrieving cars - always with a smile and despite the weather.

We only had two meals in the casual bar area.   No complaints at all - good food at easonable prices.

Finally, this hotel is rated by us highly not only for what it provides but also it's central location.",4,2016,08,12
226,Excellent stay sorry to leave.,"Our first visit to Belfast and we booked this excellent hotel. Position is very good. Surrounded by bars and restaurants. The hop on hop off bus is nearby as is the main bus station. You can easily walk into the main shopping area. Our room was excellent, comfy bed, the size of the room was very good and the furnishings very stylish. The room was exceptionally clean.  We had breakfast, they have a good choice all the food and drink is of good quality. the staff are very, very good. Friendly, professional and smart. Whoever runs the staff training at this hotel is doing a very good job. Well done. Loved our visit. ",5,2016,08,11
226,Over night stay in belfast,"What a hotel... Really has everything! The location is perfect, the staff are really helpful... For someone who doesn't often stay in hotels such as this they really made us feel welcome and not out of place! I would strongly recommend this hotel to anyone visiting Belfast! The rooms are incredible! Comfiest bed I've slept in ages! üëåüèª 10/10",5,2016,08,11
226,Great Hotel,We spent two nights in this hotel. super location. The rooms are quite roomy. Breakfast was top class. It's nice to be able to order your hot choice from a menu (not pre cooked). Bar food was very good. Private parking available. Staff were very efficient and friendly. Would recommend highly. ,5,2016,08,10
226,Excellent hotel,"This is a really first class hotel. My wife, either through a moment of gleefulness or impishness, booked an 'accessible' room for us. This fact we didn't notice until it came to the morning. The fully open 'wet room' shower in the corner of the bathroom was superb, but the fact that the sink was a knee height did pose a problem! However, if you were disabled the room, I can assure you, is perfect. I would comment that a shelf in the shower would have been nice - there is nowhere to put bottles etc. The room was delightful - clean and well proportioned, and was serviced excellently. We ate in the hotel restaurant twice as it was such good value and an excellent meal. If I can make my only negative comment: the hotel offers a ¬£55 for two plus bottle of wine option, which is excellent. They should be very proud of it. It is written on the side of the hotel and on a poster in the lift. Yet on both occasions we were only given the a la carte menu and the waiter wandered off. We had to ask twice for the 'offer' menu. This is not their fault - it is hotel policy. It is embarrassing to have to ask. Give both menus at once please. Breakfast excellent. And all the staff were superb",5,2016,08,10
226,Great place to stay,"Stayed for one night on a business trip.

Entrance to the foyer is relatively low-key, but once in the feeling is of luxury.

Concierge staff were excellent and welcoming.

Room was well-specified, very comfortable bed and pillows. Linen was clean, bathroom was a good size and shower had an appropriate pressure.

Location of the hotel is excellent for exploring central Belfast.

Breakfast served in the restaurant; a good continental selection, and attentive service.",5,2016,08,10
226,Slice of heaven,"Great experience from check in to check out. The room was comfortable and quiet and lacked nothing except a powerpoint near the tea station. 
Staff were friendly and helpful, breakfast tasty and lots on offer. Location is perfect for bus to airport or Dublin
We will make this our home in Belfast from now on. 
",5,2016,08,10
226,Perfect Date Night Stay,"This was our first visit to The Fitzwilliam Hotel and will certainly not be our last we had a fantastic stay. Everything from the d√©cor, the food/drinks and staff where all exceptional! 

We stayed on the Date Night offer of B&B with evening meal. Fantastic value for money. We have never had such a delicious meal in a hotel, it was exceptional! The waiting staff too were so friendly, chatty and attentive. Breakfast in the morning was equally tasty with hot and cold options. 

The d√©cor is stunning, trendy, but sophisticated. We stayed in an Executive King room which was spacious and very comfortable. 

At every stage staff were extremely helpful - we contacted them prior to arrival as our flight arrived into Belfast City Airport in the morning to see if we could leave our luggage with them at the hotel to enable us to sight see. This was easily accommodated by them and on arrival our room happened to be ready and the receptionist actually offered to take our bags to the room to allow us to get straight out to do our sight seeing! Super!

Cannot wait to come back again!",5,2016,08,09
226,Absolutely top notch!,"We were in Belfast for a wedding and chose the fitzwilliam based on the reviews here. It lived upto the hype, 100%! The room (a suite) was stylish, stunning, comfortable and well equipt. 
The staff were lovely, especially Gerard, the amazing kind, helpful concierge. He couldn't do enough to help, and not in an overbearing way! 
The breakfast was in a league of its own! I'd happily eat it 3 times a day, every day! Every element was perfectly cooked and of a high quality-poor quality ingredients are a pet peeve of mine but there were none to be seen here. 
I cannot wait to return to Belfast or to try the sister hotel in Dublin. I would happily live at a Fitzwilliam hotel ü§ì. ",5,2016,08,08
226,Lovely hotel. ,"Hotel is lovely and handy for everything in Belfast. Room was clean and spacious. Ate in restaurant food out of this world. Breakfast cold buffet or hot food cooked to order. I would rather have a full buffet but that's just my personal preference, and the breakfast was lovely and well cooked. 
Couple of small issues but the staff were friendly and helpful in sorting them out in a professional manner. The staff were all friendly and professional and nothing was a  problem to them. ",5,2016,08,08
226,Birthday treat for my partner,"Booked this and asked for a cheeky upgrade as it was my partner's birthday, but unfortunately there was none available, thou the room we stayed in a king-size deluxe was lovely, modern, clean and spacious... 
We had a meal in the restaurant, the soup was absolutely gorgeous, my main course which was steak was very thin and overcooked, but the sides were lovely. As we were celebrating a birthday I asked the waiter if I could have a candle in partners dessert, but he offered to write a message on the plate, so I was very disappointed when the dessert came out with no message.  Service was very slow, probably 40 mins for our soup starter to come out from kitchen.
The best part was a cocktail we had in the bar on our way back into the hotel, the barman (Brian, I think) was so pleasant even thou it was nearing the end his shift, very talkative and friendly, asking how our day was, interested in what we'd done and where we'd been and apologising for the poor service in the restaurant, even thou it was not his fault... 
Would have been 5* if the service in restaurant has been better...",4,2016,08,05
226,Trendy ,Very nicely decorated hotel in the heart Belfast! All staff were friendly and helpful! Food was nice and cocktails were well prepared! Rooms were spacious with some nice views of Belfast! Couldn't fault any aspect of our stay and we will be back. ,5,2016,08,05
226,Excellent base in Belfast,"We really enjoyed staying at this pleasant hotel.  The staff were charming and the rooms were spacious and comfortable. In particular the restaurant supervisor, Gabor, was extremely helpful in making sure everything was just right.  It is very well located in central Belfast. I would highly recommend it and certainly consider staying there on a future trip.",5,2016,08,03
226,Amazing!!,"My boyfriend and I stayed for 3 nights for my birthday. I can't fault the hotel at all! The staff are absolutely lovely and made us feel very welcome and cared for. 
The rooms are very spacious, modern, clean, and the bed was very comfortable!
The drinks at the bar are quite well priced for a city centre hotel and are very nice.
Overall our stay was amazing, the hotel is in the perfect location, definitely recommend! The only place I will stay if I return to Belfast!",5,2016,08,03
226,Two Night Stay - 31 July to 2 August 2016,"The Fitzwilliam is a modern  city centre hotel and proved an ideal hub for our attendance at a wedding in Belfast. The bedroom was spacious and comfortable with a good bathroom providing bath and shower options. We liked the retro black telephones....

Staff were friendly, efficient, knowledgeable and helpful.

Not too expensive and we would use again.",5,2016,08,02
226,the staff was just wonderful,"this place is so clean and perfect. only booked 30min before we got there.
the room was so new and clean  
would like to thank all the staff at the fitzwilliam hotel 
in how they looked after me and my wife",5,2016,08,01
226,Amazing city break,"Stayed in the Fitzwilliam on 30th July. We arrived at 3 just in time to check in. For once I left my boyfriend in charge of booking the room..and of course he booked the wrong night. The staff were so understanding and so helpful. Although the hotel was fully booked they got us a room in no time at all and it was no trouble to them. Honestly the most accommodating and polite staff I have encountered. 
The room was absolutely beautiful. Could not fault it. 
Had drinks in the bar. It was buzzing on the Saturday evening and served the nicest cocktails. 

Had such a wonderful stay and cannot wait to return.",5,2016,08,01
226,Good location and trendy ,"Reception were very friendly, room was nice and trendy. Would like a window to open however. 

Concierge was very helpful; however didn't look very happy. Parking was handy as they parked the car and all for you and get your keys any time you want. 

Close by to some lovely restaurants, will defo return ",4,2016,08,01
226,Fitzwilliam,"Great hotel-very close to shopping area. Has valet parking

Decor a little dark but sophisticated

Room has very comfortable beds and a luxurious bath and seperate shower- we stayed in an executive double room which was very reasonably priced. Had a great view of Spires cathedral/independent mall

Has a good restaurant/ room service options

Very friendly staff- I would definitely stay here again",4,2016,08,01
226,Winters Treat for Tattoo trip,"Had a very special tattoo booking with an artist in Belfast, was going to drop in and out in one day, til the missus got wind of it. Braying donkeys, hungry over-tired children and the wrath of the wife all need avoiding where possible whilst on this mortal plain. and a trip to Belfast was already long overdue. May as well style it out, i thought, shure its chicken for christmas dinner anyway.
Wanted a special hotel for my special someone, and what a treat we found. Open and spacious, no-bother staff, amazing rooms, vague cocktails,all in the heart of the city. There's a stiff wind that blows through the town, and no small amount of rain, yet Belfast doesn't bother itself with weather worry, not with your sweetheart to cuddle into, an umbrella over your bonce, and a blazing fire in the foyer as welcome. 
Great hotel, great memories made in Titanic town. Would love to return day soon. 
And the tattoo came out lovely, feeling no pain. Took 2 trains, a bus and 2 taxis to get us back to Cork, glowing all the while down.",5,2016,07,31
226,Would be perfect with certain adjustments,"Beautiful hotel, decor to die for, lovely staff, great cocktails and fab location!

But..

Not sure if we were just a bit unfortunate with our room; terrible stench of sewage in bathroom which meant I couldn't enjoy a candle lit baht as I wanted (nice touch!), shower flooded the bathroom floor every time we used it, door to bathroom kept sticking, if my bf hadn't been with me I'd be stuck in there, no plug for kettle so had to put it on the floor and the lid would not stay closed so was scolded by the boiling water.. 

This would have been the perfect hotel if it wasn't for these small issues - adding up to a bit of an annoyance.

",4,2016,07,31
226,Amazing service ,Stayed here last night as part of a family birthday celebration. I can only lavish praise on this hotel. A birthday message and some beautiful treats were in the room. We were staying as part of the Friday 'wine & dine' package at ¬£79 per person which was a 4 course meal that also included a bottle of wine per couple. Great value. The rooms are beautiful and the modern clean style is just fabulous. I would recommend any visitor from any part of the world to go here and feel assured they would be treated like royalty. There were so many little touches. Like my brother in law went to the bathroom during dinner and the waiter immediately covered his food with a cloche till he returned. The lovely waiter from Hungary. The really nice and attentive bar man. A treat for all and a credit to Belfast. Thank you. ,5,2016,07,30
226,One of the Best Hotels in Belfast,"The Fitzwilliam Hotel is very convenient to Gt Victoria St Train Station so no need to bring car into City. Very pleasant reception area and friendly welcome at check in. Room spacious, clean and very comfortable bed. Breakfast had been ordered online at ¬£10 each thus saving ¬£7 on menu price. Great selection for breakfast. We decided to eat in the Hotel for evening meals as well on both nights. There was a special 2 course for ¬£16 each between 5 and 6.30pm. The food was really good and service from waitress, Jordyn, exceptional. Hotel is within a short walking distance to the City Centre. It was lovely around the City Hall with the weather being warm and sunny. Shops had great sales especially Victoria Sq. A very enjoyable 2 night break in Belfast.",5,2016,07,29
226,Luxury in the heart of Belfast,"My wife treated me to a weekend in the fitzwilliam to celebrate a significant birthday. Check in was swift with a very friendly young lady behind the front desk, we had a suite on the 5th floor with great views  over the city from the giant corner Windows. The room was awesome, one of the most comfortable beds I've ever had. The bathroom has shutters which open up to create one large open plan room. Allowing you to have a bath with a glass of wine over looking the city. A great way to start the weekend. We dined in the restaurant that evening. The food and service was second to none. I had the lamb rump with rosemary jus and it was just fantastic. My compliments to the chef. After dinner we went for a few cocktails in the bar. I must admit they are pricey, and the bar was quiet on that particular night so we took a few of them back up to the room. 
We went shopping in Belfast the next day and due to the miserable weather the front desk offered us a complimentary umbrella, it's the simple things like this that help the Fitzwilliam stand out. Once again I have to pay tribute to the staff, always very obliging! 
All in all a great weekend and I will not hesitate to stay here again. ",4,2016,07,29
226,Fabulous Shirt Break,"On arrival at The Fitzwilliam Hotel we were greeted by the Concierge who took our luggage, booking in was quick and efficient and it was so nice to hear a friendly Irish accent.  

The whole hotel had a smell of newly fitted carpets , the room was spacious with a sofa and table, writing desk, huge king size bed, beautiful bath and  shower.  Tea and coffee facilities , iron , ironing board, slippers dressing gown and safe.

The staff were all friendly and could not do enough for you , we had a lite lunch in the bar which was excellent and evening meal in the restaurant , the goid was excellent my husband had the lamb he said it was the best he had ever tasted he is only 72 years old, huge big thank you to Anna who went that extra mile and made our evening very special, the family photo she took was great thank you again Anna.

The Irish breakfast again was huge and the staff could not do enough for you again lovely Irish staff so friendly and so many of them and different from the evening, so looking  forward to our return.",5,2016,07,28
226,Belfast Beauty,"Just stayed here for 3 nights. Ideal location in heart of Belfast. Rooms lovely, decorated in an Art Deco style. Staff very helpful and polite throughout the whole hotel. Food at main restaurant and bar absolutely delicious. Great stay and would highly recommend the Fitzwilliam. ",5,2016,07,28
226,Valet Parking Highly Expensive Ripoff,"The hotel room at the Fitzwilliam Hotel was extremely comfortable and the bathroom absolutely gorgeous.
But the only thing that spoiled our stay was the concierge. On arrival we were told by the concierge that the hotel have a valet service at ¬£17 per day. My partner spotted a secure car park about 50 meters from the hotel and was told by the concierge that to park the car there would cost ¬£16 per day. We naturally left the car with the hotel overnight as it was only a ¬£1 difference in price. The following day we inquired at the secured car park as to the price and to our surprise we found out it only cost ¬£6 for overnight parking. However you do have to collect your car at 8am or simply extend your parking ticket. And as we were staying at the Fitzwilliam we could have pick up the car at 10am and pay nothing for the extra 2hours as long as we get our ticket stamp at reception. We were not told this by reception or the concierge. Suffice to say we were not at all happy about it. ",3,2016,07,28
226,Good location with rennovation occurring,"As other TA reviewers indicate this hotel is close to City Hall in the CBD. The foyer is a nice place to sit and watch the world go by. The conceirge staff are very friendly and helpful.
The lighting in the hallways outside the rooms is strangely dark. The rooms are large and clean. Our friends stayed on a lower floor and the carpets and soft furnishings seemed to have been updated - on Floor 8 in our room they were 'past their prime'.",4,2016,07,28
226,"Great Service, Great Location","Everything about this hotel was fantastic.  ALL of the employees were helpful, friendly, and quite approachable.  Our room, which had been recently remodeled, was relaxing and classy.  The hotel was within walking distance of a variety of restaurants and the downtown shopping area. My husband and I thoroughly enjoyed Belfast, partly because of the wonderful experience at the Fitzwilliam Hotel.",5,2016,07,27
226,Good Choice for Central Belfast,"Special Thanks to James McAteer (Duty Manager). We had some minor issues with our room which James addressed quickly by swapping our room for us. He even loaded our car on check out day while we took a bus tour. Putting 2 bottles of water in the car for us shows a genuine understanding of great customer service.

Our initial room had a faulty A/C unit and a non-functioning hairdryer. We were offered a choice to wait for maintenance next day on the A/C or to move. We selected a move. Even though we moved down from 6th floor to the 3rd floor, the room was still very quiet. We overlooked Grosvenor Road but never heard a noise.

The hotel is decorated in an interesting scheme. The lobby is bright and welcoming but almost everywhere else has gone for dim lighting and darker colors. The rooms are fine but the bathrooms are quite dark. My wife has trouble finding enough light to apply her make up. The only suitable place was at the window itself. There is nothing ""wrong"" with the decor - we just feel it would be better in a brighter scheme.

The A/C is not really up to the job on hot days so if it is a deciding factor for you, be prepared that it may not meet your expectations.

We didn't do Breakfast at the hotel - there is a Starbucks across the street :-)

Parking is by valet at an onsite lot. There are limited spaces so you are advised to pre-book the parking  once you have your reservation. When you first arrive at the hotel there is no obvious place outside to park while you check in. There are two spaces on Grosvenor Street that look as they are ""no parking"" but thats where you need to be.

Location is great - right beside Grand Opera house and just around the corner from Belfast's oldest bar (The Crown). Its an easy walk to City Hall and Donegal Street for shopping. The Open Top Bus Tours leave from near City Hall but if you buy tickets from the Concierge they will call a courtesy shuttle for you.",4,2016,07,25
226,Great Hospitality at the Fitzwilliam Hotel,"We had a wonderful visit to the Fitzwilliam Hotel. The staff is great!  From the time you check in until the time you check out they are there for you.  Philip in concierge is the best! If you need help with anything ask concierge. The hotel is in a great location. We were able to walk to some great restaurants and do some great sightseeing in the city. The rooms are nice and cozy. Few hotels in Belfast have air-conditioning, but this one does. You will enjoy your stay there. ",4,2016,07,24
226,Wonderful ,We stated in the Fitzwilliam hotel in Belfast a few days ago for the first time and I can tell you now from the check in staff to the GM this is one if the best and friendliest hotels my wife & I have stayed in. If you are in Belfast or surrounding area do yourself a favour and stay here. We can't wait to go back.  Top marks to Cian and all his fantastic team.   ,5,2016,07,24

226,Fitz and Thrones,"We booked this package after hearing about it online. A full day travelling up the north coast of Northern Ireland taking in Cushendun caves , Ballintoy harbour , Carrick a Rede ropebridge and the Giants causeway also hearing about the game of thrones locations and scenes close by. We arrived back at 7pm and arrived at our luxury guestrooms. We had a lovely dinner in hotel, service and food top class. Bottom floor bar was first class and massive tv for the sport. A great package in Belfasts top hotel!",5,2016,07,24
226,great stay,"great stay, centrally located at the city centre, not too busy and not too far. Great service by front desk and concierge. Especially love the decoration of the lobby when we first arrived. Rooms are nice and pretty as well even though lightings are quite dark. But everything is all good though.",5,2016,07,20
226,Upgraded ,"This hotel is amazing, we arrived and the first thing reception said was we have upgraded your room. Omg they were not joking. The room is amazing it has a bath in the bedroom. We had excellent service in the bar and we ordered room service which was awesome. The place is really good.",5,2016,07,20
226,Lovely hotel,"Located beside bus and train station. Surrounded by bars and restaurants although hotel bar and restaurant very good.  We stayed in an executive suite which was excellent. Spotlessly clean, very comfortable and spacious. All staff that we interacted with were lovely especially the reception staff . Would highly recommend anyone to choose this hotel for their stay in Belfast.",5,2016,07,20
226,Concierge very helpful!,"Stayed here with my wife and then on business. Hotel is nice and very centrally located in a hotel cluster with Jury's and Europa alongside.

Big advantage of this hotel is that the Concierge is very helpful and friendly - this should always be the case but is often not!

We had investigated restaurants in detail and then asked for his suggestions which were spot on with our own research, He clearly had first hand experience of teh restaurants, knew the menus and was able to say when tables would be available at short notice and make the reservations - which he then did immediately without any fuss.

In addition we were looking for a Black Cab tour with an experienced guide as the difficulty with these tours is that the people mentioned on Internet as good guides farm out tours under their name/brand to less experienced guides which just gets you someone parroting lines that they have been given. We had heard of this from another couple involving a booking with a well known firm and again the Concierge was familiar with the issue and mentioned that he would get us a booking with a guide who was genuinely experienced and be the one booked - this was because the Concierge was putting his name to the deal and any problems would flow back to him, so important for him that the guide he booked was the one who showed up. So we had a tour with a driver called 'Red' who was in his early sizteis and had grown up during the Troubles in the areas involved, so he had 'lived' through the history which meant that he had experienced what he was describing, IN retrospect I think the trick in recognizing a good guide will be age - if they are in their 20's, 30's or even 40's they will be too young to know what happened. IN any case we had good tour, guide was good and pleasant and we were happy with the experience - cost was ¬£35 for about 1.5 hrs.

Breakfast was pretty good - yogurt, fruit, Fresh Pineapple, seeds, Walnuts as well as ham and cheese/bread I really liked this!

Cooked Breakfast was also available but I would only eat lean bacon that I could pick, mushrooms and tomatoes, so this only works if you have a buffet - so I kept off cooked breakfast, although others liked it.

The real advantage of this hotel is the Concierge !

Only thing I did'nt like about hotel was that although it is recently refurbished they have very low level lighting in the corridors -nearly dark - and this makes it look gloomy.",4,2016,07,20
226,Fitzwilliam Hotel Belfast,"We spent 3 nights at the Fitzwilliam.  Hotel is in a great location, at least for us and what we wanted to do while visiting Belfast.  All staff were great (hotel front end service, restaurant, lounge).  They were genuine in their friendly greetings, willingness to help and the service was wonderful.  We truly appreciated our stay.  Great job done by all.",5,2016,07,20
226,Excellent location. ,"I was staying in town for a business conference at the Waterfront, but this hotel was only a 10 minute walk away.  So glad I stayed here as I was much closer to area dining and nightlife. 

The staff is very pleasant and effective.  The rooms are on the smallish side so I upgraded one level which provided plenty of room.  

I was pleased with my stay and the only slight issue would be the air conditioning.  It was quite warm during my visit and the room AC unit ran often and was considerably loud and rattled.  Luckily, I am a heavy sleeper. 

I would definitely stay here again. ",5,2016,07,19
226,Great place to stay!,I selected this hotel because it was across the street from the Assembly Buildings Conference Centre. It was a great choice! My room was on an upper floor so I had an excellent view of the conference centre. The room was spacious and had a deep bathtub plus a shower. I think it had been renovated recently. The only problem was that the room door was out of alignment so you had to check to make certain it closed. The rate I had included breakfast and it was well worth the 10 pounds. There was a nice selection of cold and hot foods.,5,2016,07,19
226,Amazing hotel amazing staff ,"Myself and my boyfriend stayed here for my birthday and had the most pleasant stay! We were really impressed 
The staff here are so lovely ! From the reception to the bar to the restaurant everyone was so friendly which created a happy atmosphere in the hotel ! 
Rooms were so comfortable modern and luxurious. We had a deluxe room and the bathrooms were amazing loads of space and we really enjoyed having a radio in our room for background music ! 
The food was nice we found the prices in the bar to be a little on the pricey side but it was so worth it the rossinis were divine! 
We loved the main reception Lounge area and sitting beside the fire! 
Beautiful Irish breakfast we were so full after ! Hated leaving wanted to stay forever. 
Many thanks to the young blonde repceptionist wish I could remember h r name ! She was so friendly on arrival and wished me happy birthday which was a lovely touch ! 
Beautiful hotel , good food and the nicest friendly staff ! 
We will be back , thank you for a lovely stay !  
",5,2016,07,19
226,Excellent hotel ,"Just stayed one night and great staff accommodation and breakfast 

Thank you!

Just one request please raise the issue of rude customer service at the mcauslands  car park you recommend across the road! 

The guy that served us was an ignorant man!!!

Please don't drag the perception of your customer service to their dregs ",5,2016,07,18
226,Best hotel in Belfast!,"Stayed at the Fitzwilliam for 1 night including the ""wine & dine"" package (breakfast, bottle of wine and evening meal) - this was our second time here and it's definitely become a favourite. 
The room was spotless, ridiculously comfortable, beautifully furnished and staff were very helpful and welcoming.
The best part was the breakfast. Amazing. A HUGE variety of continental breakfast items and the hot food piping hot with lots of it! Service was quick, delicious and served with a smile! Will definitely be back and already considering purchasing a gift voucher so others (my parents) experience the same quality of stay! ",5,2016,07,18
226,Great location and service,"I've just spent two nights in the Fitzwilliam.   The location is great and we were able to walk to Crumlin Road Gaol, Titanic Quarter, Victoria Square, local restaurants, etc.   The bed was very comfortable and the bathroom was pretty good.   The cold buffet was included in our booking and it was more than enough for us.   Cooked breakfast was extra but we didn't order it so I can't comment.  
Overall, staff were friendly and very helpful but Gerard, the concierge, is an amazing resource.  He sorted out restaurant reservations and a black cab tour for us and they were all excellent choices.   We had a problem with the bath and it was sorted immediately I reported it.  Valet parking worked very well for us.
I'd be delighted to stay here again.",4,2016,07,17
226,Fabulous hotel ,"Loved everything about this hotel stayed in the penthouse suite.
The service was impeccable, the comfort was way above what we expected.
The restaurant was brilliant, food and service was great.
The location is central to everything.
I would highly recommend this hotel. ",5,2016,07,17
226,First class ,Beautiful hotel rooms are big and very comfy very modern think it's not long had a face lift food is very good and the 2 course dinner with wine is really good value for money if your looking to push the boat out a bit for a special occasion this hotel ticks all the boxes it's really good for shopping and is within walking distance to the centre of Belfast would definitely recommend if visiting the city lovely stay great staff very helpful and gave good info about the city ,5,2016,07,16
226,Superb ,"This hotel is fabulous. The staff are welcoming, efficient and they cannot do enough for you. 
We missed the restaurant but ate in the bar and the food was very good quality and value. I would highly recommend this hotel for your stay in Belfast",5,2016,07,16
226,Outstanding Belfast Hotel,"Staying at the Fitzwilliam Hotel made our stay in Belfast that much better. It is located in the centre of the city close to a myriad of great restaurants and easy walking distance to all of the major shops and some key sites. 
The hotel is a perfect size and the rooms are extremely comfortable with all the needed amenities. Their choice of toiletries (Murdock) are really top notch.
What makes the hotel particularly special is the staff. To a person, they are friendly, helpful and professional. All the concierge staff are terrific and Philip in particular went out of his way to book tours and restaurants for us. We did the Black Cab tour (a must), the Game of Thrones tour (many of the cast stay at the Fitzwilliam when they are filming in northern Ireland) the Titanic tour (great). 
We ate at several terrific restaurants, including Epic which was an unbelievable tasting tour de force. 
The Fitzwilliam should be at the top of your consideration set if you are visiting Belfast.",5,2016,07,15
226,Lovely hotel with a great central location,"The Fitzwilliam is in a great location near lots of good restaurants and bars, the opera house is next door and just a few minutes walk away from one of the many shopping areas.
The hotel was spotless, the staff were very efficient and so friendly, nothing at all seemed too much trouble.
Our room was spacious and comfortable, lots of choices of hot drinks, plenty of toiletries in the bathroom that smelt lovely.
Next time we visit Belfast we will stay at this hotel without a doubt.",5,2016,07,15
226,Great Stay!,"We had a great stay at this hotel!
Friendly, helpful & efficient. They bent over backwards to assist. A special shout out to the two concierges. They were the best. They even anticipated a few things & jumped on them. Even as far as helping get our phones set. Highly recommend them. The rooms are inviting and elegant. All of the things we look for in a staff. ",5,2016,07,15
226,"Good location, Good value and Excellent Stay","Stayed here for a couple of nights on a short city break. 

The hotel is in a great location - just around the corner from the Crown Liquor Saloon, Europa hotel (where there is a public taxi rank) and about 5 mins walk from City Hall and the main shopping district.  This is a good boutique hotel that does not disappoint.

The room was clean, well maintained and stylish.  Staff without exception were extremely friendly and the service was excellent. 

Would highly recommend.",5,2016,07,15
226,Semi-luxury hotel in downtown Belfast,The Fitzwilliam was a nice hotel in downtown Belfast.  I had the pleasure of staying her for one night while I was visiting on business.  The hotel staff were helpful and friendly.  The recommendations they made for local restaurants was also quite nice.  The rooms were decorated somewhat distinctly...not in a bad way.  If anything it added to the overall experience.  The bath and bed were also nice.  I would certainly stay here again the next time I am in Belfast.,5,2016,07,13
226,Overnight stop in Belfast,"The Room was amazing 5Star standard , Staff were very courteous and helpful made our short stay very comfortable and made to feel welcome. Dinner was excellent and good value including complimentary glass of wine , nice touch.
Breakfast , good selection again 5 star standards.. We were able to leave our cases while we hit the shops The Consierge kindly carried them to the car when we eventually left.Lovely will do it again.",5,2016,07,13
226,You can do no better than the Fitz,"This place is amazing.  We've stayed at the Glasshouse in Sligo, and Maldron in Londonderry, the Merrion in Dublin and none were even close to the Fitz.  Beautiful, beautiful rooms, perfect showers, perfect beds and pillows.  Breakfast service was always spot on and the location can not be beat.  I highly recommend this hotel.",5,2016,07,12
226,A Curious Mix Of The Great And The Distinctly Average,"This ought to be, and indeed in some respects is, a fantastic hotel. The building and room decor is fantastic and maintained to a high standard. They have great complimentary products in the bathrooms and the staff were friendly and extremely helpful to a fault. 

But, for a hotel that excels in so many other ways its breakfast offering is easily surpassed by what you can get these days in a premier inn. The selection was extremely limited and if you are gluten and wheat intolerant there really is not much to choose from. You would reasonably expect a hotel of this quality to offer a commensurate quality breakfast - it does not.

Our room also only had two plug sockets in the entire room, neither of which was remotely near to the kettle and the tv was positioned awkwardly for viewing when in bed, though the bed itself was very comfortable. 

Overall a hotel that is excellent in some ways and mediocre in others.",3,2016,07,12
226,Luxury and comfort with a friendly smile in a great location.,"We arrived at the hotel, Smack in the middle of the city, great location. It was raining,  we were greeted by a doorman with an umbrella, who walked me to the door, led me in and went back to the car for our luggage. Nice start!
The girls on reception were so welcoming, very friendly and attentive. We were booked in with no hassle at all, and brought to our suite.
The corridors to the rooms are very sleek, the lighting low, and the doors mirrored.  
The room itself was lovely, subdued lighting, a big king size bed, mini bar, hot chocolate, robes, slippers, big deep bath with separate shower and goodies in the bathroom to pamper myself with. Everything you want in a hotel room.
I never really sleep well in hotels. Its always too hot or the bed is uncomfortable, the pillows hard, but I have to say, that it was the best sleep I have ever had in a hotel!!
The air con was great, kept the room at a lovely cool temperature, and the bed was really so soft and comfortable.
The room was spotless, every evening when we returned the room was like new.
There was a safe in the room for our money, jewelry etc too which is always nice.
When booking tickets to the Titanic museum, the hotel done it for us at a great price, and were very helpful when helping us decide on places to eat or things to do.
There was only one thing that niggled at me and that was the breakfast. It was expensive at 34 pounds, that was for an omelette, and a egg on toast, which was really small, but that was the only issue.
The staff in the restaurant and at breakfast were so nice once again.
We had a wonderful stay, and we will definitely recommend it to friends and family.",4,2016,07,12
226,Fantastic!!!,"Beautiful hotel room was fantastic!!Food lovely cocktails amazing.
Room had a beautiful view. Reception staff were very efficient and had great knowledge of the city.
Will return maybe to do the xmas shopping.",5,2016,07,11
226,Fantastic stay in middle of the city,"I just love this place. The hotel looks good ,our room was fabulous but most importantly the staff are so lovely. Everyone did what they could do to make your stay the best it could be. Would highly recommend a stay in this hotel. The breakfast is the best we've had in Belfast.",5,2016,07,10
226,Lovely hotel,"Just returned from an overnight stay in this lovely newly redecorated hotel. It has a very cool vibe and thoroughly deserves a five star rating. The room was cosy with everything you could want eg decaf , instant and ground coffee, never mind hot chocolate mix , tea, short bread and bottles of water. The bathroom was beautifully appointed and the shower was great. 
Service at both the reception and the bar was excellent. Nothing was too much trouble and everything was accomplished with a smile. I'll be back !",5,2016,07,10
226,Great stay.,"We stayed here for two nights 7th & 8th July and really enjoyed our time here.
We were welcomed as soon as we entered the reception and given complimentary coffee as our room wasn't quite ready,good start.
The room was huge with all the usual tea/coffee mini bar,bottled water and toiletries.free wifi.
The staff were very friendly and really knew there job.reception even printed our boarding passes for our flight home for free(some places charge for this).
We had dinner on the first night and really couldn't fault anything,first class.
Breakfast was the same,no problems.
Will definately stay here again.",5,2016,07,10
226,Nice new hotel on good location,"This must be quite new hotel in the center of Belfast. Good location. Good valet service, which - however - has to be booked in advance! Arrival by car is on Grosvenor road driving away from the City Hall which leaves the hotel on left. Room was nice, spacious shower and separate bath. Good bed. Wifi was not the best but worked. Breakfast buffet was quite minimal, but they had a good menu of English breakfast options to order. There was a minor mistake in my check, but it was corrected quickly.",4,2016,07,09
226,Simply best hotel in Belfast ,"Although this hotel might be slightly more expensive than other hotels in area, the attention to detail, quality of staff, exquisite cocktails, clean modern and unique room designs ! Stayed in all room types available from executive king to suite all leave you with a good feeling having decided to stay at the Fitzwilliam, I wouldn't stay anywhere else in Belfast apart from this hotel!  5 star's ",5,2016,07,08
226,Simply Black and white,"The colour theme of our room was black and white, but the style, class and amenities were golden.
The arrival is easy, with enough room to stop, and have help unloading your car onto a trolley immediately; our car was taken to its park, too, and the Concierge did his job with welcoming ease, the luggage arriving in our room. Classical music greeted us - our own hi-fi.
The room was huge, quiet, fully equipped; it had style, variable lighting, an extra chaise lounge and chair; the bed was a King-sized ripper.
Shower huge, easy to use, separate bath; night light; safe, hanging space with real hangers a-plenty; iron and ironing board. Fridge, cold, stocked at good prices.
Breakfast and the Bar were brilliant. Watching the cocktails being produced was enjoyable entertainment!
Departure was just as easy, with seamless luggage control and car delivery to the front doors.
The staff were efficient and friendly to a T. They seemed to be having fun helping us to enjoy our stay.
Hard to Fault.",5,2016,07,07
226,Friendly welcome in modern hotel,"Stayed for 2 nights (Sunday & Monday) on a short business trip. Warm welcome & fast and efficient check in. Room was very comfortable & well equipped (although the kettle had been removed & I had to phone for a replacement).

Corridors & Rooms are all very dark brown decoration which is tastefully done but made the hotel appear dark, especially as it rained the whole stay.

Good bar with friendly service and an excellent breakfast - although on both days I had to ask for small items that had been missed from the plate, but these were brought without fuss.

Excellent concierge was happy to call Taxis and there are plenty of umbrellas available for use (thankfully).",5,2016,07,07
226,Wonderful hotel in a great location,"The service you receive at this hotel is second to none, from the time you arrive everything is taken care of for you.The rooms are well laid out and for a city center hotel very quiet. The concierge is very helpful and will tell you all you need to know about Belfast.
We would most definitely stay again.",5,2016,07,07
226,Five Star service,"Being invited to a wedding in Ireland, we booked the Fitzwilliam Hotel,, the photographs and reviews of the Fitzwilliam all seemed positive and as it was a special occasion and the location was just right, we went ahead and secured a booking for 2 days.

This was our first trip to Ireland, on arrival at the hotel we were advised we had been complimentary upgraded to one  of the executive rooms, this does not happen to my husband and I so it was a great surprise. The room was just stunning, the staff so helpful and friendly, breakfast was lovely, overall the stay was brilliant, we will hopefully be back soon.",4,2016,07,07
226,Our best stay in the British Isles,"We recently took an extensive trip through the British Isles and Ireland visiting London, Edinburgh, Dublin, and Belfast, among smaller towns here and there.  And our stay at the Fitzwilliam Hotel was by far our favorite accommodation.  It's worth traveling to Belfast just to stay in this superb hotel.  The price is incredibly reasonable for what the hotel offers.  The room was modern, spacious, fully accommodating, and comfortable.  We also loved the hotel bar and the restaurant.  The staff could not have been more professional and helpful.  This hotel, and Belfast in general, really exceeded our expectations.",5,2016,07,06
226,Great Location,I selected this hotel based on search of best hotels in Belfast when heading there for a three night stay.  Our rooms was newly renovated and very nice.  Location wise you can walk to most of the highlights of downtown Belfast. My only comment would be that I didn't find the team members overly friendly.  ,4,2016,07,06
226,The helpfulness of the staff and the quality of the breakfast really make this hotel.,"Checked in at about 7pm, good experience at Reception. The car was booked for valet parking...and this worked well. The room allocated was crisp, fresh and well appointed. Pleased with that (my first stsy in thix hotel). Nice comfortable bed.
The bar was a bit odd in layout and decor, but the barman couldn't have been more cheerful and helpful.
Next morning my room number wad taken at entry to the restaurant and thereafter I was addressed by name by a really charming and attentive member of staff. She was a welcoming and friendly start to the day. The full breakfast was a hot, good quality and a flavoursome take on an Ulster fry in a supurbly presented format. I would retuen to this hotel for the breakfast and the breakfast staff.
All in all an excellent experience.
In addition I was a member of a group using the 9th floor conference facilities which were very good indeed. Again the staff ensured that all our needs were catered for including serving an excellent working lunch.
Most highly recommended business location. Most highly recommended overnight and breakfast.
Excellent staff including a really on the ball concierge! A very good hotel.",5,2016,07,05
226,Excellent hotel with welcoming staff,We were staying in belfast for the weekend and decided to treat ourselves with an extra night in the fitzwilliam saying we haven't stayed here before and I have to say it won't be the last time we stay here. It's in a great Central location for a start and although you definitely pay more for it than many other hotels i felt it was worth it. We were in a deluxe room on the corner which had just been renovated and it was excellent. Credit to the staff on the front desk (sunday and Monday 3rd and 4th of july) and the lads in the bar who made this a very welcoming hotel- full of life and always professional. Can't wait to return,5,2016,07,04
226,Belfast weekend,"Visited for a special weekend with my wife for her birthday. Without prompting we were given a generous birthday welcome. Fabulous hotel, fabulous staff, the food was fantastic in a newly refurbished dinning-room and all in a fantastic location. ",5,2016,07,04
226,Perfect Location,"Stayed here with a friend during a quick transit in Belfast. The location is amazing - right by the station with plenty of food options near by. Most charter tours pick up travellers from right around the corner so it was mighty convenient. The hotel was clean, modern and most importantly, safe. As a couple of women travelling alone, this safety is paramount and this hotel delivered.",5,2016,07,04
226,Amazing,"This hotel is stunning, the staff are lovely and very welcoming especially Anna in the restaurant where the most delicious meal has been had by me and my family twice and each time we were lucky to be served by Anna, she goes above and beyond and if there is something on the menu hard to pronounce, she makes you feel at ease and not embarrassed. I would definitely recommend and hope to be be back again soon.",5,2016,07,04
226,üëçüèº,"The rooms are very nice. I have stayed here twice now and intend to return again the next time I am in Belfast.  It is centrally located. The staff are pleasant and helpful. The breakfast is good however would be expensive if you went everyday. There is a cute caf√© one min walk from the hotel which is also delightful. 

Lobby bar is a delight. The staff are lovely.  We were there for a drink almost everyday. 

Folks do not eat out late in this city. Plan to be done by nine-ish and don't expect to get in anywhere after 8:30-ish. We made this mistake once and it just isn't the norm there. They close down early. 

I love this city. It is beautiful, I've been twice and there is still more to discover. I'm happy to have the Fitzwilliam as my temporary home while I am there. ",4,2016,07,03
226,Pleasant Stay,"Clean, comfortable and quiet :-)
Rented a king size room and a dbl twin room.
Bellmen were very helpful with directions and things to do.
Had dinner in restaurant on site which was good and open late.
Visit the Titanic Museum while there, you won't be disappointed. 

",5,2016,06,29
226,A great place in a perfect location,"We stayed at the Fitzwilliam hotel for two nights, and it was a very comfortable stay. The rooms were spacious and clean, and the bathroom was awesome. We ate at the hotel restaurant one night, and it was a little pricey for the quality of the food, but the atmosphere was nice and it was convenient after a long day of traveling.  They do offer breakfast room service if you fill out an order card and leave it on the door, but we woke up to the card still being on the door and no breakfast. I called and said we had left it but not received our order but instead of being apologetic, they just said it would be about a half hour until we got food. This wasn‚Äôt a huge deal, but if we were in a rush it might have been. Not to mention if you SAY this is how to order breakfast, it should actually work. 
Other than that, the staff was very friendly and the valet parking, great central location and free WIFI make it a place we would definitely go back to.",4,2016,06,29
226,Blissful room,"Loved staying here with my sister in a girly night in town, where we spent drinking in Robinsons, directly across the road from hotel. The room was amazing, really large and comfy bed for just me, spotlessly clean bathroom, and the decor was funky. Air con worked, and kept me cool during the night. Quiet and peaceful nights sleep, staying on a Sunday night. Belfast is much quieter on a Sunday. Breakfast next day was rather small and disappointing as I prefer an 'all you can eat' buffet breakfast but it was tasty. ",5,2016,06,28
226,A Most Pleasant Surprise.,"When visiting Belfast, we have always stayed in the Europa, but they were full this time, and we stayed one block away, in the Fitzwilliam Hotel. It was delightful, the people were among the friendliest we have ever encountered in Belfast. Our room was beautifully outfitted, and the bath was outstanding. We will definitely stay there again.",5,2016,06,28
226,Relaxing Stay,"Went here for my wedding anniversary last week was very relaxing. Staff were excellent couldn't do more for us. Room was immaculate and luxurious definitely be back. Very close to the centre of Belfast near pubs, restaurants and shops. Breakfast was beautiful.",5,2016,06,27
226,Great location,"Great location in city centre.  The accessible room was great plenty of room for the wheelchair, very clean and the bed was very comfortable but as with most disabled rooms the view was onto a roof with air conditioning units.  The breakfast was excellent, all you could want and very attentive staff.  The only problem we had was with some cocktails in the bar which weren't made properly but we complained and had them replaced, maybe just inexperienced bar staff.  Overall I would definitely stay there again.",5,2016,06,27
226,Fantastic spot!!!!,"Lovely hotel which is pretty hidden from the outside but I liked that. Staff were excellent and the smell of new carpet greats you with a smile. The newly refurbished rooms are lovely if a tad small and the view was a typical side road view.

Very central for visiting Belfast but you can get some great hotels in Belfast now for half the price but it is a nice change or for a treat.

The hotel bar was empty both times we
Looked in so we avoided that as it was nice outside and the bar has no windows so very dark. The breakfast was just okay, it has a strange layout and pretty tight no to comfy seating but it was fine.

If you want a drink and great music at night I highly recommend the harp bar, it's in the cathedral quarter and is always buzzing anytime of day.

Overall there was nothing to complain about but then nothing to make me go wow either.

All good!!!!",5,2016,06,27
226,Fab stay in belfast,"I stayed here for one night towards the end of June.  I was there for a surprise birthday and the hotel were happy to accommodate an earlier check in to avoid the surprise being spoilt. 
I originally booked an executive room via the hotel website and shortly before my visit decided to contact the hotel directly and asked for an upgrade to a superior room - which they gladly accepted. The superior room was great - enough space for a night or more.  Floor to ceiling windows - with a view across the city and the mourne mountains.  Unfortunately, my room looked out on to the uninspiring streets of belfast and the mountains were in the distance - but that's OK - I didn't come to Belfast to stare out of the windows.  
All of the staff I encountered were friendly, knowledgeable, easy going whilst remaining professional. 
The only downside was breakfast.  The good bits - huge selection of continental delights, fruits, yoghurt, cereal , danishes etc. 
Bad Bit - full irish breakfast - my partner and our other guests ordered this and it came to the table cold and greasy and not very nice considering the price.  I had eggs benedict which was lovely, however small. 
I would stay here again, I would probably only pay for the continental breakfast though.",5,2016,06,27
226,"Convenient location, Courteous service","Clean, comfortable rooms.  The hotel must have undergone a renovation.  No doubt an older hotel but bathrooms, carpets and lobby were updated in modest comfort.  Helpful service by the bellman.  Convenient parking across the street and easy access from the Highway.",4,2016,06,27
226,Comfortable stay in Belfast,"My wife and I stayed here for a night as we passed through Belfast on our way to Giant's Causeway and the rest of Northern Ireland. The staff was very kind and helpful especially considering our early checkin needs. The hotel is nicely located such that my wife and I were able to walk to the market and to the Titanic museum.

Note that when you stay here, you will need to get valet parking as there isn't really much parking that is nearby. This is an extra charge so just be aware.",4,2016,06,26
226,Nice hotel that is trying hard,"I stayed at the Fitzwilliam for 5 nights. The hotel has been under going obvious renovations and over-haul. 
The good- The Fitzwilliam is trying..HARD. The staff is in abundance, I don't say that lightly. At the adequate hotel restaurant I must have had interactions with a minimum of 6 staff members at every meal. That included the buffet breakfast. This might sound a bit over whelming but the staff seemed to really be invested in good service.  The front desk, while some seemed inexperienced, worked hard to make sure I was taken care of. The rooms are nice and the cleaning staff is friendly and competent. The hotel is in a fabulous location- easy walk to so much you want to see. The rooms are well equipped with the usual comforts but also supplied nice shortbread cookies and hot chocolate mix. 
The not-so-good
As mentioned, the hotel has been going through a lot of renovations. The overwhelming smell of new carpet was hard to take. It was really, really strong.
The bathroom shower is extremely slippery- as Gerald, the concierge, warned us ""you will break you neck if you are not very careful"" that was the Gods truth! 
The views are limited. Mine was of a bricked over building, but it was not too big a deal. The beds were a little too firm and the sharp bed frame end corners were a nasty thing to bump into ( again, something Gerald warned me about ) in the middle of the night. The vast majority of the staff was fantastic, they really tried hard to please. The morning I left ( around 5am ) there was a front desk attendant who was snarky and condescending. I did not get his name but he was the first and only staff member that was down right rude. 
Over all, I would stay at the Fitzwilliam again. It was a reasonably priced hotel in a great location with staff that aimed to please.",4,2016,06,25
226,Very Nice Place To Stay in Belfast,"This is an excellent place to stay in Belfast in a very central position. Our room was very clean, and comfortable and modern without being all style over substance and all of the staff we met were extremely nice and helpful. 
I would have given a five star review but the breakfast (which was not included in our room rate) was really not very good at all. This wouldn't deter us from staying here again we would just have breakfast somewhere else nearby which we decided to do on our second day. Note to management you really ought to be able to put on a better breakfast than this but in all other respects we were very happy with our stay.",4,2016,06,25
226,Best Concierge ever!!( Gerard),"Stayed here last month when my partner and I visited Belfast. We had a two night stay and really enjoyed this hotel. We ordered a room service breakfast in bed  the first morning and ate in the restaurant for breakfast on the second morning and both were lovely, really tasty food and freshly cooked. Staff were helpful in terms of information,  I have to say that we spoke to Gerard the Concierge on different times through our stay and we could talk to this concierge for ever he is so pleased and knows his stuff my partner a month later is still speaking to family and friends about the guy, We are hoping to come back next month to stay longer and go on one of the day trips to the Causeway Coast that Gerard was telling us about I would even pay to take Gerard with us as he is so intelligent and would be better that a local. He is a credit to your hotel. see ya soon!!!",5,2016,06,24
226,Outstanding ,"I'm a huge fan of Belfast, the city is continuing to emerge with so much new culture.  I've always stayed at the Fitzwilliam anytime I visit. The hotel which is located in the city offers exciting bars, restaurants and nite life all within walking distance. Though don't forget to check out the cocktail list in the hotel bar , simply amazing ( Pear Drop) is so refreshing!! The reason I always return is because of the location and the service they deliver.  The staff here literally go above and beyond to make sure their customers come first always!!  I've made reservations direct by phone and always got amazing service, it really makes one feel appreciated as a customer and that they value your business. Danielle in reservations whom I dealt with was a true professional, she went above and beyond to make sure I was taken care off, her words were simply "" if our customers are not happy, we're not happy"". She is a credit to Fitzwilliam.  Rooms are spacious and so comfortable which is always a bonus.  My recent stay was in a suite located on the 8th floor which give me amazing views of Belfast. There is exciting things going on with Fitzwillam Belfast, and I feel I will remain a loyal customer for many years to come, this hotel is a cut above the rest in my eyes!! ",5,2016,06,24
226,Welcome to Northern Ireland,"Gerard, the concierge, met us at the door, unloaded and parked the car, arranged for luggage transfer, gave good information, arranged for a Black Taxi tour the next day and arranged to load the car and have it ready when the tour was done. In short, he could overcome any negatives about this stay, and then some. The hotel is in the process of being re-done, and our room up on top had the new carpet smell; however the decor throughout the hotel is superb.  Staff at the desk were also very helpful. Lunch in the pub was very good - nice selection and great conversations with the staff. Dinner in the main restaurant was so-so.",4,2016,06,22
226,Gorgeous hotel,Stayed here last night and didnt wanna leave. Gorgeous hotel throughtout. Service is brilliant and staff are very friendly and helpful. Room was lovely and bed very comfortable. Breakfast was amazing and id deffo come back here again,5,2016,06,20
226,Great Stay,"We had a very nice room here on the 6th floor with floor to ceiling double aspect windows. Very stylish decor, quality furnishings...spacious bathroom with power shower and a large separate bath. good toiletries...soft fluffy towels....Mrs P couldn't fault anything...downstairs a very comfortable lobby area...we didn't take breakfast but did have dinner in their excellent restaurant. Staff were excellent ...special mention to Stephen the concierge who booked a couple of tours for us and was a mine of local information.
Belfast is a great city to visit don't miss the Titanic Museum...the Black Taxi tour...dinner in the great room of The Merchant Hotel...but most important of all don't miss staying at The Fitzwilliam",5,2016,06,20
226,Pre Theatre,"Food fantastic, location 5*, however employing staff to fill tiny glasses of water???? 8 times they appeared???????? How necessary? Just back from the Westbury in Dublin and I poured my own water, large jug was left on the table, imagine? Staff were lovely, management, wise up!",4,2016,06,17
226,Another great stay,"I've stayed her a number of times, each time just as great.  Hotel is always lovely.  Rooms are spacious and clean with a super soft beds and a great bathrooms.  Located nicely in the heart of belfast close to everything.  Love coming back here.",5,2016,06,17
226,Group dinner,"A group of us ate here recently. The dining room was quite dark with no natural light. We ordered from the pre theatre menu which was good value. My seafood tartlet was nice ( though I've no idea what it consisted of as I couldn't make it out) . I chose the vegetarian lasagne which could have done with a side order of chips. Dessert was yummy, sticky toffee pudding with coffee ice cream . The service was very attentive, with very few people in the dining room. Complimentary teas and coffees rounded up the meal. All said a pleasant outing!",4,2016,06,15
226,First Class Hotel in Belfast,"I can only provide positive comments on my 2 night stay at The Fitzwilliam Hotel in Belfast.

The hotel is centrally located in downtown Belfast. It is next door to the Belfast Opera House, within walking distance to shopping, lots of Pubs and excellent restaurants.

My deluxe room was on the 6th floor and had floor to ceiling windows with a great view of Great Victoria St and downtown Belfast. The service and amenities were 1st class. One of the Bellmen, Phillip, provided excellent advice in regards to pubs & restaurants.

I hooked up with an excellent tailor at North Gentlemen's Outfitters and ordered my 1st suit. I'll be returning to Belfast and staying at the Fitzwilliam Hotel.

The Fitzwilliam is a can't miss destination!",5,2016,06,15
226,"Great staff, great room, great breakfast.","Loved staying here. Reception staff plus concierge and porters helpful and friendly. Room bright, well decorated and clean. Breakfast beautifully cooked (and served) with good selection of cold choices too.",5,2016,06,15
226,Better than Most - But Average at Best,"With regard to the choice of hotels in Belfast, the Fitzwilliam Hotel is one of the newer and more state of the art hotel.  That is the good news...

The hotel is over priced however when it comes to the room.  The registration staff is not very helpful unless you are checking or out.  The Wi-Fi service did not work, and very little was done other than sate how sorry they were.  

When asking for directions to one of the few ""must see"" attractions, the staff gave me the wrong directions to the Giant Causeway...  It took over an hour more than it should because of misdirecting.  The ""executive"" king room had very few executive amenities that one would expect to find - like a desk with adequate power outlets.

We also had to park a block away as the hotel only had 35 parking spots.  I would strongly suggest considering one of the more traditraditonalional hotels if you are planning on staying in Belfast.",3,2016,06,12
226,Outstanding,"Just a one night stay at the Fitzwilliam Belfast.  The room was beautifully appointed and so clean.  All the check in, dining - teams were very accommodating. Arrived very early and our room was ready for us, a bonus.",5,2016,06,12
226,Super smooth,"A really relaxing hotel, we had a great deal that included a four course meal which was really yummy. Staff at the restaurant where super friendly and great service. Breakfast was really good. Eggs benedicts is delish! Great location. Room was really cost. Shower is fab. A really lovely hotel. And really quiet with super comfy beds üòÄ",5,2016,06,12
226,Great stay,"We stayed at this hotel for just a single night while passing through town and enjoyed our stay. Check in was seamless and friendly. The room was nice and modern. It was one of the few hotels on our trip that had air conditioning! The location is very good and easy to get to. We made use of their 'gym' which was a very small room with a bike, treadmill, elliptical, and a few free weights. Luckily no one else was in there otherwise it would've been quite tight.",5,2016,06,12
226,Luxurious & relaxed,"Pleasantly surprised with standard and quality of hotel and room, absolutely luxurious Bed so comfortable and room quiet. Location perfect. Staff friendly and helpful.  I think guests should have free car parking which is in a public car park opposite the hotel. Only dislike was the choice of bathroom shower gels etc, but this is personal and some people may like them.",5,2016,06,12
226,Comfortable ,"A nice and comfortable hotel right in the centre of Belfast, close to everything. The car park down the street is ¬£15 for the day. The staff are friendly and the night bar man is very helpful. Well worth staying here.",4,2016,06,11
226,Luxurious hotel in the city center,"This hotel was recommended by colleagues local to Belfast. It was luxurious and chic, and I truly enjoyed my stay. Definitely would stay again next time I am in Belfast.  The staff are friendly, the breakfast is healthy (delicious yogurt!!) and it's near several top restaurants in Belfast.",5,2016,06,11
226,Right in the city,"Great service. Phillip was so helpful. Room was clean, but not so big. We had an Executive King, with a king size bed, couch, and desk. From the sound of things, the hotel is undergoing some minor renovations. Burger from room service was great! Would stay again. Not very kid friendly.",3,2016,06,11
226,A wonderful surprise in Central Belfast,"This is a good hotel. The rooms are spacious and quiet. My room had a large wet room with a very efficient shower and all the accoutrements needed for wheelchair access.
The bed was king size and very comfortable, and all was very agreeable. The view was uninspiring, as it featured the fly tower for the Grand Opera House next door. 
The breakfast was beautifully laid out and the service was excellent.
I'd rush back here any time I'm in Belfast. What a find. ",5,2016,06,10
226,Beautiful Hotel in Belfast,"We stayed here in May, enjoying our new, clean room, helpful staff, and lovely pub and lobby. Only gave it 4 stars because the restaurant for dinner was not good, neither food nor service. Go elsewhere to eat.",4,2016,06,09
226,Fantastic trip to the Fitzwilliam!,"We are just back after to Belfast. We stayed in the Fitzwilliam Hotel, what a treat!  It is super stylish, excellent central location, courteous staff and the food was amazing!  The staff were so welcoming to our children making them feel very special.  Front of desk were full of smiles and helpful as was Gerard the concierge. 
Rooms were spacious with excellent views over Belfast and the decor was very modern. The location is superb literally in the heart of Belfast, 2 mins from the shopping area.  I especially loved the breakfast, a menu to choose from!  Just perfect and a good vegetarian option!
We will certainly be back again to stay at the Fitzwilliam!",5,2016,06,09
226,Fantastic,"I loved everything about this hotel. Close to the sites and cafes. Immaculate large room with all of the amenities.  Friendly, helpful staff and concierge services that are exceptional. Bonus points for being nonsmoking and having  windows that open. It is not cheap but it is great value.",5,2016,06,09
226,Outstanding Overall,"Booked this as it was the best rated hotel available at the time I was going.  Was in town for my 40th birthday so wanted to splurge a bit.  Mentioned this as check-in and low and behold there was a note from the Manager and some sweets left for me.  Nice touch.  Room was excellent, super-King size bed, lots of room and a very nice and spacious bathroom.  Only downside was the the tiny TV and the bathtub had some very poorly patched over holes. But both were minor enough that I didn't mention it.  Location was close to everything and the concierge even set up a bus tour for me.  Can't say enough about how good it was, well done!",4,2016,06,08
226,Great Hotel,"We stayed here on a Friday night. This was our second stay at this property. Stayed in a ""Superior"" corner room. It was very spacious and comfortable. Bathroom was clean and had good amenities. The staff are very attentive and friendly. The hotel is in a very good location and it's easy to get around the city from the hotel. Only downside was the breakfast. The buffet is quit poor with a very basic selection. Other than that it's a great hotel. I will stay here again if I'm in Belfast! ",5,2016,06,07
226,1st Class stay,last minute plans for a night in Belfast... booked only 24 hours in advance . Excellent stay ... concierge parked the car and brought it back to the door next morning . Room was beautiful everything and more that you could want . Breakfast was delicious too. highly recommended.  ,5,2016,06,07
226,"Great location, great staff, great stay",While planning a recent visit to one of my favorite cities our plans changed and we needed to find a hotel.  With only a couple of pictures and an address we chose The Fitzwilliam.  What a treat. We enjoyed every minute of our stay.  The staff was more than helpful providing some great (new to us) spots for dining and fun.  I highly recommend this hotel for your visit to this treat of a city.,5,2016,06,06
226,Generally good or very good ,"I stayed here for the weekend in May with a group of friends. First impressions very good, nice size rooms, recently decorated, new bathrooms. The location was great everything we wanted to do was very walkable. 
The bar was very nice but was busy when we met up for pre-dinner drinks due to people heading there prior to visiting the opera house next door and who can blame them: great cocktails!
The downside for me was that there seemed to be a general issue with the aircon in the guest rooms. The first room we nor the hotel staff could get below 27C, we moved to another room the next day on another floor but this time the room was even hotter at 28C. Others in our group had similar issues. 
",3,2016,06,06
226,"Very nice, great location","This hotel was in the perfect location.  Both airports were a quick cab ride away, and there were many sites, restaurants, and pubs within walking distance.  The room was very nice with a comfortable bed. The staff were fantastic!  They were all very friendly and happy to give recommendations and directions.  And umbrellas. :)",5,2016,06,05
226,Excellent Hotel ,The Fitzwilliam hotel was very nice and had the friendliest and most helpful staff. The room was a little dark which was our only complaint. It was a great place to stay for location. Maybe just add some brighter lamps! The did give us an excellent tip on a fine seafood restaurant. I would recommend this hotel to anyone traveling to Belfast. ,4,2016,06,05
226,Wonderful experience,"We went here for a meal and cocktail master class as part of a hen party and we had a truly wonderful time. The staff were all very friendly and helpful, and the food was absolutely delicious. Best part of the night by far was the cocktail masterclass, Brian was brilliant, very funny, friendly, bubbly and he made us all feel at ease from the beginning. His guide through the cocktails was very informative and easy to follow. I would highly recommend this experience and would definitely recommend Brian as a mixologist, he was just fantastic! Thank you very much for such a wonderful night and we'll definitely be returning!",5,2016,06,05
226,Fantastic,"Stayed on 2nd June for one night and from the beginning to the end of our stay we received  nothing but 5 star treatment .The staff are amazing, cannot wait to return. Well done the Fitzwilliam.The only place to stay while in Belfast .",5,2016,06,04
226,Luxury in Belfast,"We arrived and the concierge came out took our luggage made arrangements for the car to be garaged on site all while we checked in.
The room came with everything you could need including terrycloth robes and slippers. Everything about this place is outstanding especially the friendly staff. We will definitely return.",5,2016,06,03
226,Lovely hotel in the heart of it ,"We had a lovely stay at the Fitzwilliam for our weekend break. The hotel has very nice decor and extremely friendly staff who can't do enough for you. The bar area is quite pleasant as is the main reception area with the nice open fire. The room we had was clean, nicely furnished and quite spacious. The only thing I couldn't comment on was breakfast as due to a combination of strong Belfast ale and getting in about 2 we did not make it ! Loved Belfast and will be back ",4,2016,06,03
226,Business meeting,A good hotel but I found the lighting poor. The room was good and well provided with facilities I would expect. Excellent service from the concierge who agreed to keep a piece of luggage to be collected by a friend even after I had checked out. The location was excellent for good restaurants nearby. Excellent service at breakfast with good choice and quality. I was allowed to start earlier than 7am (which is late for busy business people with early meetings!). A positive experience overall. ,4,2016,06,03
226,Getting it right ,"Visited the Fitzwilliam on an overnight package which included dinner and breakfast in their studio suite. From making my reservation to checking out I can have no complaints. Everything was handled professionally.  The room was spectacular and well worth the money. Dinner was very good, as was room service breakfast. Try the cocktails!",5,2016,06,02
226,"A Beautiful, recently refurbished hotel","This hotel was extensively refurbished in early May 2016 and has been very tastefully renovated.The room had both a shower and a bath and was very clean. 

It had the feel of a property that was well managed and staff were well trained and extremely helpful.

Breakfast was included in our tariff and was very tasty. We also visited in the bar which was busy and vibey again with great staff.

The location is great for shopping, site seeing and night life

A couple of factors that stop it being a five... the air conditioning seems to be badly designed and even when set to the minimum left the room too warm for us (we had the concierge visit and they couldn't make it cooler) and why oh why are the tea and coffee facilities so far from a power point which means you have to lift out a heavy tray?",4,2016,06,02
226,Disapointed,"Really had high hopes for here if I'm honest , stayed here one night and the hotel is beautiful but the staff let it down big time, very judgemental and look down on you. The hotel itself is gorgeous and the rooms are beautiful but really needs to give the staff a good talking too
Really disappointed",3,2016,06,02
226,Excellent hotel at very reasonable prices compared to London ,Had an excellent experience recently in this hotel. Had booked a nice suite at a very reasonable price ( compared to London) and arrived to find out I was upgraded to the penthouse ......a good start for me!! The location is very central and valet parking provided through the hotel (at a cost). The penthouse was what you'd expect in a 5 star hotel and did not disappoint and I highly recommend ( if you can push the boat out a little - same as a big 2 bedroom upmarket apt ). The restaurant was good (not 5 star but not bad) but good value and food was very good. Staff were very friendly and helpful. Unfortunately I did not get to stay another night in the penthouse suite as I had to go but I will be back.  ,5,2016,06,01
226,Nice Hotel,"Spent the night in the Fitzwilliam en route to a conference.  Room was very spacious and bathroom was well stocked.  Breakfast was excellent with loads of selections.  I gave this a 4 rating as it was just missing the little touches that I would expect from a 5* hotel.  Overnight parking @ ¬£17  was a bit steep.  Overall, the stay was very good and I would go back again ",4,2016,06,01
226,Belfast visit,It's one of the lovely hotels I have been fortunate to stay with. The people are just the best! They cater to your every need and they're very helpful. I love the hotel as it's very clean and the rooms are spacious as well as the bathroom. I had a great time staying in this hotel. ,5,2016,06,01
226,bitthday visit,"arrived Friday 27/may wow! reception fab,natalie booked us in it went as smooth as silk and all with a smile, all reception personnel are fab could not do enough to make your stay great. then in restaurant and bar grill brian,megian,blinda just could not do enough in serving you, even the housemaids where great.
the management should be proud of this hotel and how its run, [I have named but a few] I would recommend this hotel to anyone wanting to visit Belfast.",5,2016,05,31
226,"Lovely City, lovely hotel","Stayed for two nights and after booking on a fully flexible rate, changed it to an offer rate they had running closer to our travel dates that included breakfast and an evening meal for both nights; so was great value.
The hotel seemed to be going through a very discreet minor refurbishment, which meant the carpets had recently been laid on our level and our room was in excellent decorative order.
The food was of a very good standard, both breakfast and the evening meal.
The location of the hotel is excellent for a city visit, although Belfast is such a lovely little city any location would be good.
The staff in the hotel were fantastic. Everyone was so friendly and helpful, from Dermot on the concierge desk to the room cleaning staff. All so warm and welcoming. 
I would wholeheartedly recommend this hotel and when I visit Belfast again (it was such a welcoming and vibrant city, so I will be returning) I would look at returning to the Fitzwilliam as my first option.",4,2016,05,30
226,Retirement do - everything we hoped for,"We chose the Fitzwilliam hotel as we had been here for a night out at Christmas time and the atmosphere and service had been top notch but the pre theatre deal swung it. There was great choice and the food was delicious. As a group of 37, this could have been chaotic but it all seemed seamless. The only (very small) issue was having to ask a few times to get water and when someone asked for a slice of lime in their glass of water, they were told that this could not be facilitated.  The staff were friendly and courteous and the bill was worked out to our advantage, which is decent. ¬£16 for two courses and ¬£19 for three - excellent. Service was not included, which for a group 37 is unusual and trusting. We went to the bar after, which provided the same excellent service and providing complementary nuts is a nice touch. All in all, I would highly recommend it.",5,2016,05,26
226,"Ideal location, and lovely staff","We stayed in a deluxe double room on the 7th floor and the room was lovely. The whole hotel is clean and well looked after, and all the staff we interacted with were friendly and very helpful. 

There were nice little touches with deliveries of chocolates etc and our room had all the facilities and toiletries that you would expect from a good hotel. It is ideally located within easy walking distance of nice restaurants and bars, and I would happily recommend it. 

The only thing stopping me grading the hotel as Excellent was the price. I was happy to pay over ¬£200 for the room, but I've had much bigger rooms in other capital cities for that money.",4,2016,05,26
226,great hotel in a great location,"Set next to the opera, this hotel is just a few blocks from most sites you might want to see in downtown belfast. The room was comfortable and aesthetically pleasing and we would gladly stay here again anytime. Staff were wonderfully helpful and made it an even more positive and memorable stay from this holiday in Ireland.",5,2016,05,25
226,Lovely hotel ,"Just back from a 2 night stay at this fabulous hotel. 
Beautiful room with amazing decor 
Bar service was excellent as were the cocktails.
The only let down was the restaurant for me the restaurant  was very basic with a very limited menu we received no bread at the start of our meal where all the other tables did the main course was slightly cold and also the sides were left and had formed a skin on top 

On the second night we had bar food the food  was much better very tasty and the brownie was to die for!!

We will be back perhaps not to the restaurant 

 ",4,2016,05,24
226,Very professional hotel,"Booked an overnight stay for my daughter and her friend to stay here in May.  They loved it and especially the room service breakfast!!!

The staff on the front desk and the conscierge were very happy and helpful.  

Bedrooms are uber modern with all facilities. 

I would have no hesitation in recommending this hotel",5,2016,05,24
226,Great location,Hotel is situated right in Belfast's city centre. Everything was within walking distance. Room was modern and very clean. There wasn't a great view from our room however we didn't mind as we were only there for 1 night. When checking out we were made aware of a ¬£17 parking charge. Parking is available near by for less. This charge should be made clear when booking however we knew our car was safe as it was on hotel grounds behind locked gates.,4,2016,05,24
226,Going down,"Planned to stay there for 4 nights and escaped after 2 nights :( 
This is 5th or 6th stay there, and they are going down from stay to another, the rooms are getting too old without any renovation, breakfast is still the same since they opened",2,2016,05,24
226,Lovely Belfast hotel,"I stayed for three nights, 26-29 August, 2015; for business.

This is a wonderful hotel in Belfast. I stayed for three nights, as part of a conference. The hotel is very well located in Belfast, and super-close to anything that you may need, including shopping centers, postal services, and late-night eating. The check-in was professional, friendly, and easy. 

The rooms are nice, but tend to be a little on the dark side. If you are room-bound for a length period, this could get tiresome. But, the showers in the bathrooms are great, and the bed is very comfortable. Breakfast was extensive and nice!

I would recommend this hotel for a stay in Belfast.",4,2016,05,22
226,Fantastic Stay,"I stayed here for the first time for an anniversary on 23rd April.

I can't fault the hotel at all.

The reception staff were welcoming, the bar staff were so friendly and the restaurant staff were so attentive.

I'll definitely stay here again, and recommend it to anyone else.",5,2016,05,21
226,Diasppointing,So for ¬£150 for one night you'd think you'd get a room that didn't have sub standard furniture but we did. Then we got hit for another ¬£17 for car parking from 2.30pm to  10.20am the parking in a shopping centre would have been cheaper. Not to mention the drilling from 8am in the morning the only thing I could recommend was the location. Bitterly disappointed,1,2016,05,21
226,Extremely friendly and efficient staff,"An overall excellent hotel, all the staff were very efficient and extremely helpful..
the room was clean and very comfortable, the bathroom had a fine range of toiletries and reasonable size bars of soap!
We were staying as part of a large group and as were impressed with the service at dinner and the standard of our food (which was pre ordered from a multiple choice menu ) which was excellent.
Breakfast service again was very attentive, a good selection of cereals and cold buffet with prompt service from the extensive hot menu.",5,2016,05,20
226,"Lovely Hotel, Very nice Bar.","Stayed here last weekend when my husband and I visited Belfast. We had a two night stay and really enjoyed this hotel. We ordered a room service breakfast the first morning and ate in the restaurant for breakfast on the second morning and both were faultless, really tasty and fresh. Staff were helpful in terms of information, even the security guard when we popped back in for some directions when we had visited a few bars. They booked several taxis for us which all arrived promptly. We spent some time in the bar ordering cocktails which we charged to our room. The first couple of drinks we ordered were abit underwhelming but they were quite busy and a young girl prepared our drinks so putting it down to lack of experience. We called back later on and had more cocktails prepared by a man called Jamie and they were spot on, served in the correct glasses with the right amount of alcohol and lovely prompt service. A live DJ was situated in the corner of the bar playing chilled music and there was a lovely atmosphere about the place. Our room was clean with lovely interior and a large bath and shower. Cannot really fault this place and would definitely stay here if we visit again. Great weekend. ",5,2016,05,20
226,Disappointing,"Given the other reviews for this hotel, it was really disappointing to not have the same experience that other have had. On the day of arrival we received an email to say their would be building work in the lobby, which was not a problem. However, when we arrived we were informed that the restaurant, which we had booked in advance, was also closed and that the food would be served in the bar.

We had requested a specific room which we were given. The best thing about the room was the fantastic views over the city and the bed was very comfortable. The not so good was the badly stained net curtains, the blood on the lamp shade, the water damage to the front of the bath and the poor condition of the paint in the room. The little things others talked about in their reviews that made the stay for them were missing. The room badly needs renovated as it is far from 5 star.

With regards to out meal, I would not recommend the bar as a place to eat or even for a drink. The lack of any kind of atmosphere or ambience hits you straight away. The food was fine, not as good as the likes of Tedfords, but fine. The staff were very nice and attentive but the experience was one to forget as the place really is a souless stereotypical hotel bar. I'm sure the restaurant is better but I'll never know.

Breakfast was fantastic and we had it delivered to our room which arrived when requested.

All the staff we spoke to or encountered were very friendly and helpful. They certainly are an asset to the Fitzwilliam.

We did have a couple of small things that were addressed by reception before we left and we were offered a discount on a future stay because of this but I don't intend to pay again to let someone rectify the mistakes they made the first time so I can't recommend the Fitzwilliam and will choose the Merchant or Clandeboy Lodge next time.",3,2016,05,20
226,Convenient location and well-appointed room.,"Nearly everything's within walking distance from this convenient hotel, even down to the quay.  Our room was a delight, done up in black and white with accents of lime green, very modern B&W bathroom and even an old-fashioned black dial-up telephone!  The place was immaculate.  We had breakfast only, but it was ample and delicious.  We found the concierge very helpful.",5,2016,05,19
226,Lovely!,My husband and I recently had a 2 night stay at the Fitzwilliam Hotel and loved everything about it. The location was great as there were lots of nice pubs and restaurants nearby. We found a fab little bar called Ritas which is the most amazing place and of course the Crown is just around the corner which is well worth a visit. We walked to the Titanic museum but can't tell you anything about it as we didn't want to spend the 17.50 each to go in! The black cab tours were the best thing but all in all we loved both Belfast and the hotel and would go back to both.,5,2016,05,19
226,First Class!  Highly Recommended,"I booked the Fitzwilliam for a business trip for 3 nights and was not disappointed.  I was very pleasantly surprised and the quality for the price.
I was made very welcome, the room was amazing (standard room)...very spacious, very clean and comfortable, the shower was great - everything I needed and more to work and enjoy.  Very good location.
The breakfast was lovely
I will definitely stay here again",5,2016,05,19
226,"Well located, comfortable, great staff, spotlessly clean, great food.","It's not our first visit here and it won't be our last. A modern hotel located in the centre of Belfast, the Fitz will tick all your boxes. Close to the train and bus station and right next door to the Grand Old Opera House theatre. Loads of restaurants and nightlife right on your doorstep, you'll be spoiled for choice of things to do and places to go. 
The rooms are, in my mind, slightly larger than normal, beautifully decorated and squeaky clean. They are equipped with everything you would expect from a hotel of this quality. 
At reception there's a fire, comfy seating and complimentary papers. Perfect place just to sit and chill out. 
The restaurant is on the first floor. Breakfast choice is excellent, and the hot food is freshly prepared and served to your table. The fresh bread offering is particularly good. Marta was in charge of our breakfast. She was pleasant, courteous and couldn't do enough to help us. Nothing was too much trouble for her. 
Dinner was chosen from the pre theatre menu, and at ¬£15.95 for 2 courses or ¬£18.95 for 3 courses, it was quality food, very tasty, and good value for the money. 
Kathryn Magill, who handled our reservation, was extremely efficient in dealing with our queries and some minor concerns we had. 
There's a new colour scheme being launched and I'm looking forward to getting back to see it. There's also been a recent revamp in the check in and reception area. 
All in all a great hotel, genuinely friendly and helpful staff, quality food, comfortable and clean rooms, and really well located for visiting Belfast. 
",5,2016,05,19
226,Best Concierge Service!,"Located 15 minute walk from train station. Central to restaurants.  Spacious room.  Rooms look onto street but quiet at night.  Modern rooms that are being remodeled along with the lobby.Comfortable bed, robe, room safe.  Great shower with lots of hot water.  Elevators.  Restaurant and bar.  Breakfast not included but many coffee shops nearby.  Tea pot in room with crackers. A few problems.  One at check-in they required a prepay double the cost of our stay.  We are seniors and not likely to damage anything.  Second some computer glitch resulted in someone going in my room, opening the safe, changing code & no  note left. Unsettling to which the hotel manager just felt this was not any cause for alarm.  However, the concierge service was extraordinary.  They were extraordinarily helpful and attentive. They arranged drivers and restaurant reservations that were all excellent.",4,2016,05,18
226,A treat,"The Fitzwilliam pampers you from the time you step out of your car. The kindest gentleman helped us with our luggage and asked about our plans for the day. He arranged our taxi tour and transport to the Titanic exhibit and gave us recommendations for the rest of our stay here. He then had our bags in our room with lovely music playing when we arrived back. 
The room is rather large with a shower and bath tub. Everything is clean. There is a safe, refrigerator, music system, and bathrobes. No complaints. It is right downtown in walking distance of shops, entertainment, and food. 
The front lobby has a beautiful fire place, newspapers, books, and plenty of seating. There is room service available. Wifi works great. They have umbrellas for you and iron with ironing board. I would definitely recommend.",5,2016,05,18
226,One Night Stay,"Stayed one night following the Noah Stewart concert in the Ulster Hall on 29 May 2016. The hotel is top class, service is very good and the room was better that we expected. Room lighting and lighting in the bathroom could nave been brighter. Breakfast was excellent; plenty of choice for the continental breakfast and the cooked breakfast was very good indeed - set us both up for a day's shopping in Belfast and the Markets. Would recommend The Fitzwilliam and would stay there again.",5,2016,05,18
226,The rooms at the fitzwilliam are my favourite ,"I love the square shape of the room as opposed to the typical long room where the bed faces the wall. Although we weren't looking out at anything - it was much nicer facing the window.

Room had anything we needed including beautiful white robes.

The location is perfect for Belfast as you're close to everything you need.

We didn't get use of the hotel bar or restaurant while we were there though.. Will be tried on the next visit.",5,2016,05,18
226,Great hotel in the centre of Belfast,"Stayed here with my wife on a trip.
It is a high quality hotel, the rooms are Very spacious, fantastic bathrooms with huge showers.
Service and quality at the restaurant is very good.
In any new place it sometimes can be difficult to know where to head for the best restaurants etc.
However, we didn't fare well on our search, but subsequently found that if you turn right out the hotel and cross the road, along this road are many great restaurants, if you turn right out the front of the hotel then right again, Robinson's, about 5 mins walk is a great traditional pub, with titanic memorabilia to look at, and a great Guinness.",4,2016,05,18
226,Very good but shower a bit weak,"Hotel was great except that the water supply couldn't cope with the large shower head so the water flow was weaker than I'd like, slowing to not much more than a trickle once for a couple of minutes at a peak time. Service was friendly and efficient. Room was quite large and had everything you need except a view. Asked for the Telegraph and received the Belfast Telegraph which is a local paper not a national so be specific if it matters to you. Car park service worked ok. Didn't use the restaurant so can't comment on that. Well positioned and very good restaurants close by. Recommend Coco, Fratelli and the Crown Liquor Saloon and for great fine dining, good Italian and fantastic atmosphere respectively. ",4,2016,05,18
226,Wasn't impressed ,Stayed here last weekend for our Anniversary.Was sad to say I expect moreüòêWas given 4th floor room after checking in early & have to say noise from traffic was horrendous.In fairness they offered to move us next night but the effort of packing & unpacking again annoyed me.We decided to pay extra for a top hotel but wasn't worth it.Walls in room were in need of serious repainting.Bathroom was nice but no were to place toilet bags & forget about doing your makeup in here as lighting was bad.Had breckie which was only OK.Cooked fry was only warm & not enough selection of fresh fruit.We have stayed in Belfast many times but sad to say will not return here.If you enjoy listening to the bells on the hour this is the place for you.,3,2016,05,17
226,Unreal,"Top notch hotel with a lovely layout and the most nicest and friendly people  

Rooms are nice and spacious with great view over the lovely city of Belfast 

The restaurant served loved food and the service was very quick and the staff were very helpful and polite 

Would recommend this hotel to anyone as it ideal for anything you want to do in Belfast as it is central 

Can't wait to stay here again in the future",5,2016,05,17
226,Fantastic,"Beautiful hotel with great service. Really enjoyed our stay. Bedroom very spacious and bright with everything you could think off to include toiliteries, hairdryer, mini bar, camera. Would highly recommend to others and hope to get back again soon",5,2016,05,17
226,Delightful dining,"Myself and my boyfriend visited the restaurant last Thursday. We both had the fried squid to start and the breast of Fermanagh chicken as a main. We found our dishes to be surprisingly scrumptious and the service received made our visit even better. In particular, our waiter dean was very helpful and maintained friendly conversation while looking after us. We would definitely come back for a meal and will possibly stay in the future as it seemed like a lovely hotel. ",4,2016,05,17
226,Wonderful home base to visit belfast,"My boyfriend Kyle and I were visiting Ireland for a friends wedding in Belfast and were recommended to stay here at the Fitzwilliam by the bride and groom! 

This hotel is wonderfully centrally located. Close to restaurants and bars and the historical parts of the city. 

The staff was wonderfully kind, in true Irish fashion, and made us feel at home. 

We stayed in a queen bed room and it was nice and spacious, just don't be a typical American and call the front desk saying that the lights don't work! You have to leave a key card in a slot by the door (to save energy!) ;-) 

The restaurant in the hotel is lovely. Really amazing food and bar specials; and of course, their Guinness on tapüëåüèºüëåüèº

The gym I used every morning. Very small so don't expect anything spectacular, more like a room with 4 cardio equipment machines and free weights and a bench, but plenty for a good workout. 

I would definitely recommend staying here if you're planning on visiting Belfast! ",4,2016,05,17
226,Excellent hotel.,"We have just stayed here 3 nights, and were very happy with not only the location, which is right in the heart of the city, but also with the service and the room we were allocated.  This hotel has recently been refurbished and what a grand job they have done with it.
We would definitely stay here again!",4,2016,05,16
226,"Just at 4 star level, some improvement needed ","Just back from a weekend break in the Fitzwilliam. Both good and bad to report, although overall I feel that the staff were very attentive and that I will go back in the future. As always the hotel is very accessible, quite close to the motorway/road from Dublin as it passes through the centre of Belfast, while also being within easy walking distance of all major Belfast amenities. Checkin was very efficient, indeed I found that all dealings with the reception desk were of a high standard. After checking in we went to the bar - disappointing that they have just discontinued hop-house 13 on draught, hopefully they will reconsider! In general over the weekend we found the bar to be too loud, the booths a bit too small and crowded (felt like a diner booth, not a high class hotel), and we really weren't tempted to spend much time there. Then we went to the rooms, which in general have modern decor with a comfortable large bed. I think some upgrading is needed soon, however, with facilities such as the bill being displayed on the tv being unavailable, and in my room there was a large burn mark easily visible in the mesh curtain, which really isn't acceptable in a hotel of this price/standard. The full Irish breakfast was very nice the first morning, but the coffee was very bitter, nearly undrinkable, and had clearly been brewing all morning. The second morning we ordered the full Irish breakfast, just as before, but got 1 less rasher each and no potato cake in contrast to the first morning even though the option on the menu hadn't changed and we ordered exactly the same thing. No idea why this would change from day to day, little bit annoying. Would also suggest that the lit steps on the way out of the hotel be reconsidered, as the lights actually make it difficult to see where you are putting your feet! So in summary, a great location, attentive staff and nice decor, but falling down in some small details and not always consistent in the service provided. If any extra problems were added, this would be a three star review given the price.",4,2016,05,15
226,great hotel,"great hotel placed in easy reach of town center. staff could not be more helpful and polite. breakfast good food and service. room good although did have problems with odour from from toilet when bathroom door left open. Hotel  apologised  following our comments and has stated they would attend to this immediately and if we returned would upgrade our room.
will certainly use this hotel again and would recommend to friends",4,2016,05,13
226,Nice hotel ,"Great stay, food in restaurant was good, very comfy bed! Would certainly Recommend! Hotel staff were very helpful too, couldn't fault the place! :) very clean and tidy, ok having to write 200 characters... lol ",5,2016,05,13
226,Great Hotel,Had attended the Hotel with a number of friends A number had travelled from overseas. The meal and service as usual were 1st class. The only downside was when we retired to the lobby bar. Being a fan of local beers it was a major disappointment to find there were none on draft and a limited bottle selection. As a result we decided to finish the evening across the road in The Crown Bar.,4,2016,05,11
226,"Top class, great service and very relaxing!","We stayed in the Fitzwilliam on a Sunday and it was absolutely top class. We got checked in at 1pm with absolutely no delay and were given a nice quiet room on the 6th floor. The room was lovely with a big comfortable bed and great pillows.
Bathroom was fantastic with separate bath tub and big walk in shower.
The reception staff and concierge are amazing and so helpful and are a credit to the hotel.
We had a couple of cocktails in the bar in the evening and these were really good. I recommend the Winter Soldier.
Breakfast in the morning was super and there was plenty of choice in a really relaxed atmosphere.
The Fitzwilliam is not the cheapest hotel in Belfast but you absolutely get what you pay for. Very recommended!
",5,2016,05,10
226,Luxurious hotel,"Top flight hotel with a helpful staff. Great location with lots of shopping, eating, drinking venues within walking distance. Rooms are well-appointed and it's quiet despite being located on Victoria Street. 
   We wanted to go on a tour of the wall and they very quickly got us THE BEST guide we've ever had, Bobby Walsh. (My son recognized him from Anthony Bourdain's show.). We got a lot of information from him about ""The Troubles"" and it was the highlight of our trip to London, Edinburgh, and Belfast (with Dublin yet to go).  The location of the hotel makes it easy to access transportation. It's pricey but worth it. ",4,2016,05,10
226,5* All the Way,"Had the absolute pleasure of staying here last week with my Wife for a Night in Belfast.

Having stayed in many of the Hotels in the Belfast Area the Fitzwilliam simply stands out as the Best.

From Reservation to Departure the Service was 1st Class.

The Hotel on arrival exudes class.

Check in was Warm & Friendly but yet Proffesional.

We had booked on the ' Thank Fitz it's Friday Offer' and  I must say Amazing.

Our Room was an Excutive King on the 5th Floor and just blew us away.

Classy, Modern Style with an Art Deco feel about it.
Clean and Fresh.
With all the Facilities you would expect.

The Bathroom .... Wow.... How often do you get the choice of aWet Room or Bath!
Black and White in Style ... Perfect.
Bathrobes ....Lovely Touch.

We chose not to Dine here as we wished to explore the Belfast Restaurant Scene.

As part of the Deal our Breakfast was included as was Complimentary Cocktails in the Bar of which we took full use of .... After our return that evening.
I must say that once again the Servers were Friendly and very Knowledgeable and we're obviously enjoying what they Do.

Breakfast was probably the Best I have had in. Belfast Hotel.
It's nice that when an Full Irish Breakfast is Advertised that is exactly what you get.
Quality Irish Products Cooked and Served Perfectly.
The whole Breakfast Buffet itself was exceptional, Fresh, Quality Products Presented Beautifully.

A Complimentary Paper was also part of the Offer, so the Mirning was rounded off just Perfectly.

We left that morning with nothing but Praise for this Hotel for giving us such a Wonderful Stay and Memory.

We will return..... What do you think!

Congratulations to all at the Fitzwilliam and just keep doing what you are doing....   . See you soon üòÄ",5,2016,05,09
226,Great service in a nice location,"We were five persons that drove up to Belfast from Dublin at the end of February 2016. I had booked the Fitzwilliam hotel for us because it had gotten some good reviews, the price was reasonable, and the location was ideal.

Arriving from Dublin it was really easy to find the hotel, since it actually is on the road you exit of the motorway from. While we used GPS to get there we followed the hotel instructions for the last meters, and that turned out to be a good idea since it effectively made sure you approached the hotel from the correct side, where the GPS would have seen you approach from the wrong side with having to do a U turn on a busy road.

I had booked with valet parking, and when we arrived the concierge stood there immediately, helped us with the luggage and then parked the car for me.

Checkin was fast an efficient, and overall the staff at the hotel was really nice and helpful. The rooms were well appointed. Good beds, very good bathrooms, and all the essential amenities. We had gotten rooms on the second floor, and the hotel is situated in a busy area, but we had no problems with noise. There was a nice bar in the hotel, again with a friendly and efficient staff, and the breakfast was very good. The bacon was dry, but since that is the only flaw I found it was overall very good.

What stood out was the helpfulness of the concierge. He gave recommendations for restaurants, which we followed, and was great with advice overall. When we checked out after having stayed for two days we asked the concierge if we could store the luggage while we walked a bit around town. He went a step further and offered to put it into the car so that when we came to get the car it would be all ready to go. I made a note of their names so I could mention them in this review, but since it took me a few months to get around to writing it their names escape me now, sorry lads! 

Anyway, the hotel is in a perfect situation to explore Belfast from, and we did that of course. The two stand out things to do when visiting Belfast for me is to visit the Titanic exhibition and take the black taxi cab tour to the trouble spots. 

I recommend the hotel and would stay there again on my next visit.",5,2016,05,07
226,Would use hotel again,Stayed for 3 nights. Very central to all locations. Hotel staff excellent. Breakfast good. Stayed on the forth floor at the front of hotel. Traffic a bit noisy but this was ok. Rooms cleaned every day. Staff at the checking desk were great. The concierge staff were excellent.  Would highly recommend this hotel. We will use hotel when we come back to Belfast. ,5,2016,05,06
226,An amazing hotel! ,"Stayed in Belfast several times, usually at the jury's across the road, after being very disappointed we decided to book the Fitzwilliam for our next stay.

From arrival, to departure the hotel and staff couldn't have made the experience more pleasurable, nothing was too much, everyone was very polite, if anything TOO polite! 

Genuinely though, from a personal note on arrival from Cian Lander, to the handmade sweets in the bedroom, the the toilet in the room, I can honestly say it has to be one of the nicest hotels I've ever stayed in!

We will be back.
Thanks again Chris & Danielle - Room 715",5,2016,05,03
226,Friendly staff and nice suites,I was in Belfast for some business and in need of a decent hotel so I tried this hotel. The service from the staff was impeccable upon arrival and through out my stay. I stayed in one of the suites and it was a great size with lots of amenities. Room service great and the hotel bar is nice to sit in with a good range of drinks. Definitely one of the better hotels in Belfast.,4,2016,05,03
226,Beautiful Hotel,We stay here everytime we come to Belfast and this time the experience was even better. From the girl in reservations manner on the telephone right through to the maids every single member of staff at the hotel are so helpful and go above and beyond to assure you feel at home. The rooms are so comfy and the clean. The breakfast is unbelievable! The bar cant really be much better and the cocktails its serves is amazing. Will return again soon! Gets better every time.,5,2016,05,01
226,Restaurant visit only,"Nice enough surroundings.. Slightly unclear where to find the restaurant so had to ask where to find it to discover it is on the first floor accessible via the lift. 

Lift felt quaint with the small lamps on the back wall against the mirror. 

Restaurant looked ok but very dark. Food Presentation was good. 
Service was just ok - ordering was slightly strained and I had to eventually get up and go find a waitress (much to the amusement of the couple at the adjacent table who clearly did see my attempts to attract attention from the staff!!) which I felt was bad form.

My steak was a bit fatty and I was disappointed that I had to remove some from my mouth whilst eating due to being difficult to eat - I've had better elsewhere. 

Lastly.. Service was very slow.. It took 2 hours to complete our meal which might be acceptable if that is all you've planned for an evening but I felt it was a bit much before a theatre performance. 

Had the dark chocolate tart for dessert which was really nice..",3,2016,05,01
226,Best hotel stay in a long time,"Would highly recommend this hotel! Brilliant night in a modern vibrant central hotel with amazing staff who are all very attentive, polite and helpful. The restaurant is lovely and cozy and the food was gorgeous, also the breakfast which is cooked to order. Thoroughly enjoyable stay and will definitely be back :) ",5,2016,05,01
226,Overnight visit with dinner,Stayed for one night in April . Excellent service throughout our visit. There was refurbishment work taking place and the staff explained what was happening and that it would be finished early and begin late the following day. Lovely modern room in keeping with the style of the hotel. Dinner was delicious with friendly well trained staff Put this hotel on your list for a stay in Belfast,5,2016,05,01
226,Excellent service combined with fantastic food!,"Its in Belfast City Centre and I took my wife there for her 30th for the night (Sunday Night). From walking to the place and being greeted by the receptionist was brilliant. She was a pro and so friendly. 

The room we got (Superior Room) was fantastic and everything you wanted. 

Dinner in the restaurant was out of this world. From the staff who took us to our table and the lady who served us, everything was brilliant! 

Breakfast the next morning was brilliant with a cooked breakfast and self service continental breakfast it had everything you wanted. 

I would highly recommend this to anyone and we will be back!!",5,2016,04,29
226,Lovely place to stay,"The hotel is reasonably small and centrally placed in Belfast city. The rooms are a good size with lots of nice design features. The bar is perhaps a bit noisy and a bit modern, but the modernity is in keeping with the theme of the hotel and there are a couple of more traditional pubs almost next door.

What makes the hotel, though, are the staff: very attentive and ready to help, especially the concierges.",5,2016,04,28
226,Cocktail Making Class,"A great day out for the girls, the guy taking our class was good fun and a great teacher. Cocktails where lovely, and the little gift after was so nice. A beautiful hotel and the staff where friendly.",5,2016,04,27
226,Enjoyable family meal,"Had dinner at the fitzwilliam hotel before going to a show in the opera house  ,food was well presented and very good quality but portion  sizes were small  .overall a pleasant experience but quite expensive for what you get",4,2016,04,26
226,Bathroom was designed by a man,"This seems to be a hotel that prides itself on design. However the design touches are superficial; there has been zero design thinking around the actual guest experience.

Paid extra for a better room (Signature) and still got a room with a stunning view of the garbage area. 

The room is missing a luggage rack.

Since this is evidently a nice enough hotel to provide bathrobes, slippers would not be an unfair expectation. 

Power socket was provided on only one side of the bed - really not sure why. It's a room for 2 people and everything else in the room provided in pairs. I was on the side without the socket and had to get out of bed to walk to the desk to reach my charging devices. Very inconvenient.

And finally, we come to the bathroom that was designed by a man. Sigh. 

1) No vanity space on the sink, only a sliver of glass for toothbrushes. Too easy for cylindrical shaped objects like eye pencil, mascara etc to roll off. Had to put my toiletries bag on the bathtub, which was not only hard to reach, there was nowhere to spread out my things to find them quicker.

2) Lighting was asymmetrical and insufficient for make up.

3) Shower stall only had a rain shower. There's a reason that rain showers anywhere else ALWAYS come with a handheld shower option. Firstly, the shower stall was already chilly because there isn't a door. With a rain shower you have to stand in an awkward bending position to stay under the water to keep warm while preventing shampoo from rinsing off before you're done lathering. And to my general complaint about the bathroom designer, rain showers are not conducive for washing certain parts of the female anatomy. Also the shower pressure was abysmal.

4) Nowhere to hang towel for easy reach from the shower. Basically just nowhere to put anything.

5) The soap holder in the shower had an inexplicable gap on one side. I had a tube of facewash that fell through the gap, crashing to the ground.

6) Also, the sink plug and the toilet paper holder were stupidly designed. It took several minutes to figure out how to unplug the sink the first time I washed my hands; and it is impossible to change the toilet roll while sitting on the toilet. Serious UX fails.",3,2016,04,26
226,Dull and expensive for what it is,"Entrance, Tiny foyer, reception, lifts to room. That surprised me, apart from the restaurant(1st floor) and bar, that its. Room was good, bathroom excellent. Minor points were lots of wires hanging behind dressing table and kettle had to be put on floor to reach a plug also TV reception breaking up, (pixelation weak signal). Good large bed and good pillows. Bar is expensive with some weird low seating,weird seats in restaurant as well. Food good,small portions,breakfast not bad,tea was undrinkable and cold. Staff very polite but this hotel has no other amenities. Just a place to sleep.",3,2016,04,26
226,A bit of class in the heart of the city,"I have stayed in most of the Belfast city hotels and this is by far the best all round package. The reception staff were genuinely friendly and I received an upgrade when they found out it was my birthday. Well appointed superior room, with a great view down one of the cities main roads. We had a few drinks in the bar after eating out and I think they have exaggerated the level it sits at. There are more atmospheric bars in close proximity to the hotel.",4,2016,04,26
226,Cocktail classes,Took part in the Fitzwilliams cocktail class with 8 other work colleagues for a day out. From we first arrived we were made to feel very welcome.When taken into the bar area we were greeted with a glass of prosecco and everything set up for the fun to begin. Our bartender Brian Crozier was amazing throughout.Whilst he played along when we were having fun he also was very knowledgable when we asked questions regarding certain cocktails and their history.A very enjoyable day which was finished off with a little goodie bag with a small bottle of prosecco and some delicious chocolates.Thanks to Brian for a fabulous day!,5,2016,04,25
226,Great hotel and location,"The staff at this hotel are amazing. From the time we arrived to the time we left all staff from reception to concierge, bar staff and breakfast were all amazing.
The rooms are large and spacious, great beds and bedding.
Tea/coffee, ironing board, hairdryer etc.
The biggest let down for us was the fact that we had a disabled bathroom 
(don't know why ?) which was THE most awkward bathroom we have ever had. No where to put a toiletry bag, no where to put shampoo or even a bar of soap in the shower. Couldn't fill up the kettle unless using the shower hose as the sink was so small, my husband couldn't even shave in it. 
If you stay here make sure you DON'T get a disabled bathroom. One night might be ok, but 4 nights....no way.
Other than that i would highly recommend this hotel for it's location and service and also the buffet breakfast has everything you could want. 
Wifi is also very good here.",4,2016,04,25
226,Weekend to Belfast,"Lovely hotel, got a real London feel to it. The food was great in the hotel, location is perfect and within walking distance to everything. Customer service from the staff was really good, the only downside was the clock from the church going off every hour.
Maybe next time we will request a room at the back of the hotel not facing the street.",5,2016,04,25
226,"Great hotel, excellent location","Booked in at the last minute and was not disappointed...great service and excellent rooms but can someone please get the cleaners to spend more time in the restaurant. In the booth we were in for breakfast, the wall had dirty splash marks up it and the shelves/dividers had not been dusted in quite a while .....",5,2016,04,25
226,Beautiful hotel,Great staff could not do enough to help. Very modern and comfortable room with all you could wish for in such a good hotel. Right in the centre of Belfast so good location. Hard to park outside and lacking a little in other amenities but would go back..,4,2016,04,21
226,Not the best but not the worst,"Ok so let's be clear, this hotel is not awful,  but this is NOT a high class hotel either.
No room service at all after midnight - not even a sandwich, I do not expect to be told that I can use ""just eat"" if I have the right app on my phone - not the kind of service I expect at a hotel portraying itself as high standard

I left my room in the morning to go shopping and when I returned at 3pm the room still had not been made up. When I asked the maid in the corridor to please make my room up she cleaned the bathroom (neglecting to replenish used items, including toilet paper)
she then asked.... Do you want me to hoover, I declined but asked for the mini bar to be replenished as I had drunk  the water. She duly left 2 bottles and buggered off, no making of the bed !!

Breakfast was nice on day 1, day 2 I was presented with a very undercooked and inedible poached egg and elements of my breakfast missing (black and white pudding)

On checking out both me and my travelling colleague challenged our bills, indeed my friends was over ¬£100.00 incorrect - with the receptionist saying, oh yes your quite right those are other rooms bar bills they should not have put that on your room, well YOU check it please before presenting it to me because that's just poor.

On the plus side, the rooms were spacious and comfortable and nicely decorated.",3,2016,04,18
226,Sloppy Vegetarian Meal in restaurant,"This review is my mother's experience on the 17th April 2016 as dictated to me.

I was really disappointed with my recent visit to the Fitzwilliam Hotel. It was a group booking following a visit to the Grand Opera House.
As a vegetarian I had no choice of dishes, and accepted the only thing offered on the menu; Spring vegetables, orzo pasta, tomato sauce with garlic bread. Once the dish arrived, there were no vegetable of any kind visible; I presume they must have been incorporated into the bland sauce that was stirred through the pasta, meanwhile the parmesan that was also promised could teach MI5 a thing or two about being incognito.
There was no texture, taste or anything of interest about this meal, it was presented poorly and why anyone would think that a dish of mashed potato would serve as a good side dish is beyond me (I didn't order this)
In contrast to how it was advertised, this is not, in my opinion, a balanced meal, given that it was mostly carbohydrate, with no protein available - yet it is offered as an equal alternative to chicken or lamb dishes which obviously had been prepared with much more thought and skill.
My vegetarian dish was neither enjoyable, nor value for money, whereas the other meals looked as though someone actually cared about the dish. 
Given the standard of alternative venues in Belfast where an entire menu of vegetarian choices are available, it will be a long time before I will be returning to the Fitzwilliam.

Belfast is being promoted a food destination, particularly this year, for goodness sake sort this out and do better.",3,2016,04,17
226,Excellent hotel,"Lovely stay here. Rooms very bright and spacious. Had dinner and breakfast here also - both meals very nice and good quality. Excellent location, in Belfast City Centre, close to all big attractions. Have stayed in The Europa hotel next door and think the Fitzwilliam was better!",5,2016,04,13
226,Fantastic hotel,"My friend & I enjoyed a fabulous stay in the Fitzwilliam. The rooms were spacious & stylish with very attentive & accommodating staff who went out of their way for you. Special mention to the two Dermots! Nothing was too much trouble! The hotel itself is in a great location to access all areas of the city. Breakfast was fantastic, cooked to order and of high quality. The bar service was good and had a nice atmosphere. Would absolutely stay again. ",5,2016,04,10
226,Fitzwilliam,"My partner and I visted the Fitzwilliam for an overnight stay,- the rooms were decorated to perfection, same with the lobby as you enter!! We also had breakfast included, all your fruit, cereal type breakfast was self serve but if you were having a cooked one you just placed your order with one of the staff-  we enjoyed our stay and would definitely go back again!!",5,2016,04,10
226,Home from Home,"I stayed here many times during a business secondment in Belfast and the hotel became a home away from home for me. The hotel has all the amenities that a business traveller would expect. Breakfast was always well organised, promptly delivered and filling.
The staff are delightful, always friendly, and if you come here a few times, very good at anticipating your needs. The central location is very handy for the shops and businesses of Belfast, and not too far from George Best Airport if the traffic is willing.",4,2016,04,08
226,Bar Snacks,Been to the Fitzwilliam often since Vincent O'Gormon's days. Seating still needs to be sorted but food excellent as always. All staff attentive but were made to feel particularly welcome and comfortable by Brian who is an absolute credit to the Fitzwilliam - prompting my first ever review!,5,2016,04,07
226,Pre theatre bar snacks,"We recently went to the Fitzwilliam for a bar snack prior to attending a show at the Opera House. Opting to avoid the pre-theatre menu in the restaurant was an excellent decision as we were served promptly and efficiently, thereby avoiding the last minute panic of dining upstairs which we had previously experienced. The food was good in both quality and quantity. What prompted me to write this review, however, was the exceptional service we were afforded from our waiter Brian. This young man is a credit to the establishment and an excellent example of how to provide 5 Star service. We will definitely be back on our next theatre visit!!!",5,2016,04,06
226,Wedding celebrations,"Superb room with king size bed, very comfortable night's sleep. We also had a lovely sofa in the corner of the room, floor to ceiling glass that gave us fabulous views of the city. Breakfast was brilliant. Freshly cooked to order with a great range of ingredients in the buffet. As the hotel was in a central location we were able to easily experience the delights that Belfast had to offer. 
To top things off the staff were friendly and professional and nothing was too much trouble for them. We will use this hotel again.",5,2016,04,06
226,Stylish and friendly 4* at the heart of the city.,"Great central location, very friendly and helpful staff and stylish contemporary public areas. The bedroom was great, it was a good size, had designer styling, a comfortable bed and a great bathroom with both a walk-inshower and a bath. The cocktail bar had a good atmosphere as well as friendly and efficient service. The concierge was fantastic; knowledgeable, friendly and helpful. We would stay here again. Top end of four star!",5,2016,04,04
226,Amazing event,"We had a fabulous evening at a Murder Mystery event dinner at this hotel. Service was excellent, the food was wonderful and we were so well looked after by Tim and the team. Lovely, welcoming and fantastic service!",5,2016,04,04
226,Best coctail masterclass,"I recently stayed at the hotel for a hen do and we had a coctail masterclass!!our host was called brian,and he really made our weekend extra special!!our hen party was all age ranges and everyone attending really enjoyed themselves, and brian made it fun and went the extra mile, so much so that although our class was 3-5pm, he left us the room to stay in when the class was over, and supplied us with prosecco and canapes!!really couldnt recommend brian and the masterclass enough,already planning our return for the masterclass again!!we met brian serving in the bar again later and again made sure we were all catered for fast and efficiently, thank you brian, you made our weekend extra special!!",5,2016,04,04
226,2 night break in Belfast.,"We stayed in the Fitzwilliam for 2 nights last week and couldn't say enough for the staff and their friendliness.The location of the hotel is excellent.Breakfast was very good.We had a package which included evening meal on one night which was just very ordinary.Our room was on the 6th floor and a bit too hot the first night as the air-con was noisy.But I would recommend this hotel to future visitors to Belfast for location, friendliness and cleanliness.",5,2016,04,04
226,Will not be back!!!!,"I can't complain about the room as it was stunning, but what annoyed me the most was that bloody spire clock ringing every 15 minutes until 9 o'clock at night then ringing from 9 in the morning again, sound proof windows would maybe be an idea?
We has booked dinner with our stay which was a three course meal.
For starters we both got the chicken and onion soup- no amount of pepper would stop the soup being bland and tasting like cardboard.
We then both got the steak and chips with side portions of peppered sauce and vegetables. The sirloin was gritty and extremely fatty and tasted vile. The chips were greasy and tasted extremely funny, and don't even start about the vegetables... are they using some new disgusting oil that tastes like crap?? We then had the sticky toffee pudding, how could they get this wrong?? they did...... both the sauce and the cake were burnt, we ended up leaving pretty much everything and ended up ordering a dominos.  They also charged us ¬£19.99 for a pint and a corna with one extra side?? really??
The breakfast was pretty standard, the cold breakfast was nice, but the cooked breakfast not so much.
The staff were lovely but the food was vile and that bloody clock was ridiculous, I know we wont be back !!! waste of money.  !!!!",1,2016,04,04
226,Another warm welcome,"Myself and my wife stayed on friday night on a bed and breakfast package. As soon as we came through the doors we knew we were in for another treat . Our keys for the car  were taken one way and our bags another allowing us to check in hassle free. We were checked in by a girl with long red hair who was not only informative but took the time to chat to us about our plans and also acknowledged that we had stayed before , this made us feel very special indeed.

Our next stop was the bar , in the bar we were greeted by the lovely manageress who quickly tucked us into a booth . My wife wasn't sure of what she fancied to drink but after a couple of questions about what my wife liked taste, flavours etc the manageress was able to suggest  a cocktail that my wife described as 'the tastiest' cocktail she had ever tasted. Before we went into the bar we had intended to go in to the city to check out some of the new spots but we ended up staying most of the evening as we felt so relaxed. The bar staff are exemplary.

Our room was spotlessly clean and had all the amenities you would expect from a 5star hotel. Very comfortable. The bathrooms are the highlight for us.
 
Our breakfast the next morning was also good, service prompt and cooked breakfast (made to order) was one of the best hotel breakfasts we have had.

On checkout we visited the bar again for a spot of lunch and were recognised instantly by another blonde manager in a suit who remembered our names (and our drinks from the night before !!!) our lobster macaroni and burger were lovely also.

We cant wait to return - thank you!",5,2016,04,03
226,Fantastic night for a special occassion!,"I booked to stay here for my mother's birthday as we were travelling to Belfast to watch a rugby match in the Kingspan Stadium. From we arrived until we left the staff made us feel very welcome and went above and beyond to make our stay pleasant and relaxed.
We stayed in an executive room which was amazing and were delighted to have a plate of pastries to have with our tea / coffee when we arrived. The room was well equipped with everything we needed and the decor was beautiful. There is also free wifi, a safe, and toiletries for your use as well as a minibar which we did not use.
Breakfast the next morning was delicious and plentiful, my only suggestion would be offering fresh tea or coffee as both got cold quite quickly and we had to request a second pot of hot tea for my mum - the staff were quick to get this and in general were very helpful and friendly but I know some people would possibly feel cheeky asking so just a suggestion.
All together a lovely stay and I would recommend and will most definitely return for a night's stay with my husband in the future.",5,2016,04,03
226,The place to be,"The place to be. Less than five minutes walk from 1. The bus station serving the airports. 2. Many of the restaurants currently in TA's top ten. 3. Two of the cities great traditional Irish Pubs (the Crown and Robinsons). 4. And just about everything really because Belfast is a walkable city, the furthest distances we walked were to the Titanic quarter and Crimson Road Gaol, both under 30 minutes. As for the Fitzwilliam? A well presented hotel, standard rooms perhaps just a little dated ... dark almost oriental feeling, but they contain every modern amenity you'd expect from a 4 star hotel. The key ones being a warm room, quality bedding, good shower and good speed free Wifi. Kept clean and well maintained. We had a street view room, a little noisy from the road but it won't keep you awake. Breakfast a good selection of hot and cold offerings again well maintained and always tidy. The bar was a pleasant way to start and end our evenings, with well made cocktails and a very wide selection of drinks and bar snacks if you wanted them.

What made the hotel, pretty much like everywhere in Belfast, was the people running it. Reception and staff concierge always interested in us and wanting to chat and share their city with us. Breakfast team super efficient during a busy weekend. The bar was the only hit and miss bit, probably because they were short staffed a couple of times so the empties piled up and we weren't quite sure whether to bar queue or be waited on. This was the only one blip in an otherwise great stay.

Well worthy of its star rating.",4,2016,04,02
226,Leisure,"Quiet  boutique hotel ..lovely warm interior .. With a great location ..next door to Opera House ..nd just a few minutes walk from most of  the city attractions .. Such as the Botanic Gardens .. City Hall ..  Queens University ..Victoria Square ..nd more ..bus nd train stations r just behind the block ..
Attentive Friendly staff (thanx Yara).. Clean modern rooms .. Delicious food .. Good breakfast although it's a little bit limitted .. Special thanx to 'John' .. The professional knowledgeable concierge .. Who helped us  nd arranged all the tours to explore the city nd around in just 3 nights ..
Overall .. I would highly recommend it and come back again ....

226,Nice Hotel but Uneven Service,"My friend and I spent two nights in Fitzwilliam Hotel, Belfast this week.

The hotel is new, well designed and well located.  It has potential to be a leading hotel in the city.

We decided not to eat in the hotel restaurant because the Trip Advisor reviews were poor.  So our experience with staff service was confined to the receptionists and the bar staff.

The receptionists were first class, and very pleasant and efficient.

The bar staff however need training, leadership and management.     For the duration of our stay there was a large ugly pile of unwashed glasses at one end of the bar,  which was unpleasant to look at.     And on our second night at around 10.45 pm the bar staff disappeared totally.     Several guests wanted a drink,  but there was nobody to serve them, and most customers just left the bar.

So it's a nice looking hotel,  but there's huge work to be done in staff training.",3,2016,04,01
226,A weekend in Belfast,"My advice to anyone staying over in Belfast, book this hotel as quick as you can!!!
The hotel and staff are amazing, ive stayed a few times now and the quality is consistent never changes. The rooms are perfect, spotless and comfortable. The staff have always have a smile and a hello when you pass. As you have prob noticed by now I really like this hotel, the whole package!!! Congrats to the GM and staff for a job well done, il look forward to our next stay. Oh the cocktails, I nearly forgot to mention them :)) the best ive ever tasted and really good value, even if your just visiting call in and have one The Bramble is out of this world!!!!",5,2016,04,01
226,Great hotel with a great location,"This is a very friendly hotel it a great central location. Our room was spacious, comfortable and very clean with a large bathroom and shower. The entire hotel was clean and the staff very friendly. It has valet parking so all you have to do is pull up at the front door, however the parking costs ¬£15 and I don't like paying for hotel parking. The bar and restaurant is spacious and quite atmospheric. The location couldn't really be better as you can walk to anywhere in the city centre. It is a bit pricey compared to other Belfast hotels but I suppose you pay for service and location.",5,2016,03,31
226,The Best of The Best in this city,As the title suggests this is what I think of this hotel from the staff to the food and drink I could not ask for better. If you want a taste of the penthouse feel then 702 is the room for you outstanding.,5,2016,03,29
226,Fabulous hotel worth the money!,"Staff at this hotel so polite friendly and cannot do enough for you!
Huge bed, modern rooms and all amenities you could need. We had breakfast every morning great selection and the omelettes were so good. 
Location is very good, rooms quiet, clean, even lend you umbrellas which you will usually need in Belfast! 
",5,2016,03,29
226,Good business stop over ,"I stayed here for one night on a business trip. This is the second Fitzwilliam I have stayed in and can say that each have had consistent high quality staff and design. It's a great looking hotel with well trained staff. 

Overall, I would say that this is a good value choice. It's also a good location to access some cool parts of Belfast. ",4,2016,03,27
226,Excellent Location and Comfort,"I really enjoyed my stay at the Fitzwilliam Hotel. The hotel is modern and well located. From my room I could hear the nearby church bells ringing, which was very beautiful. There was a large sofa in my room. It was very comfortable... (Wondering if I could get one for my own place?) Highly recommend overall. ",5,2016,03,26
226,Fantastic customer service.,"Thank you for the upgrade to one of your beautiful suites. Really enjoyed our stay, the staff were excellent and the food was exceptional. Location is perfect, a short walk to the city centre shops. We will be back.",5,2016,03,25
226,Belfast Rooftops,"My girlfriend and I booked a suite here at the Fitzwilliam to celebrate our anniversary, and have to admit it was one of the very best hotels I've ever stayed in. From the stunning rooftop views of the City. to the plush rooms, great service and food, and the magnificent city centre location, this is unbelievable value",5,2016,03,25
226,"Good Location, Great Service","We had a little trouble finding the hotel, as it is slightly difficult to see from the car.  They have limited signage, and it does not jump out at you from car level.  That said, we really enjoyed our stay.  It is fairly centrally located to the sights in Belfast.  The rooms are large and comfortable.  We did not have a street facing room, but our room was very quiet.  The staff is very friendly and professional to a level I have not experienced in many hotels.  Also, while there is not on site parking, they did arrange a parking spot for me in advance of my stay, and one of the doormen valeted the car.  Overall, I would stay here again if in Belfast.",5,2016,03,25
226,Wonderful hotel in the heart of downtown,"My husband and I, along with my parents, stayed at this lovely hotel while in town for a wedding. We all absolutely loved it --- rooms are comfy, staff is eager to assist, location is within walking distance of many restaurants and bars.  The room sizes are slightly larger than typical Euro rooms and are very clean and comfortable.  My only criticisms are that the bedding itself could be improved -- super heavy comforter, no sheets (too hot); the bathroom could use better lighting for putting on makeup.  That's really about it, we had a wonderful stay.",4,2016,03,22
226,"So relaxing, amazing room all over great hotel",I have family in Belfast so i go to a hotel every year to see them. I seen Fitzwilliam where having a sale on rooms so I booked straightaway. It was always my dream to stay in this hotel and oh how it lived up to that dream. I got a simple room the cheapest one in the hotel. With this I got a bath and walk in shower. I got a king bed which was huge and so comfortable.  There were blackout curtains a sofa tv and radio. As well as this there was a mini bar fridge. The room was great for my boyfriend and I. I didn't want to leave the hotel . I had the most amazing sleep I've ever had. The staff are lovely and really helpful. Always have a smile on their faces. The hotel is just beautiful.,5,2016,03,20
226,Love this hotel!!!,"What a wonderful hotel!!  We were away for four weeks and stayed here for two nights, but it was by far the best hotel we stayed in.  Centrally located, huge rooms and huge bed and beautifully appointed.

We didn't eat in the hotel, so I can't comment on the restaurants.

I would highly recommend and would definitely stay again.",5,2016,03,20
226,Outstanding,"I have stayed at this hotel on two separate occasions, and have never been disappointed. The rooms are huge, the beds are massive and it is spotless clean. The staff where so friendly and so approachable. There is a wonderful, if not expensive, bar and restaurant that served beautiful food and an amazing pint of Guinness.",5,2016,03,18
226,Very nice- request a view of the church ,"This was the first hotel we stayed at in our trip around all of Ireland.  And it ended up being the best hotel we stayed at our whole trip.  Good location and very modern room.  

I'd request a room looking at the church across the street, but I'm not sure if you can here the bells that go off every hour?  We had a terrible view of an alley area but didn't mind.  It was very quiet which is important to me because I'm very light sleeper.  

The only other thing is the shower is the usual open air kind (with no door) you see nowadays and I hate those because they are freezing.  

The breakfast was very good and made to order! ",4,2016,03,17
226,Great night away with boys,"Stayed for 1 night with four friends, great hotel and great bar downstairs very central for clubs and pubs too.  Nice to come back to a bit of luxury at the end of the night! We stay again this time I will take my girlfriend!",4,2016,03,16
226,Wonderful hotel,I stayed here when I had to be in the area for business & it immediately got onto my list of places to return to. The decor was modern and professional. The staff were welcoming and it felt like a treat to be there even though I was alone.,5,2016,03,15
226,Excellent Hotel in the center of Belfast,"5 minutes from a train station with direct connection to the city airport, the Fitzwilliam is perfectly located in the center of town. The prices are reasonable, the water is hot, the service is fast, the internet connects and breakfast is quite good.",4,2016,03,13
226,Average dinnrr,I had a very average pre dinner here. The decor is ok but not the nicest. I ordered burger which was quite nice. The staff where lovely and eager to help in every way possible. It has a nice friendly vibe and is good if you are having a pre theatre as the opera house is very near ,4,2016,03,10
226,Nice place,"First time I have stayed here and have to say truly enjoyed my stay and experience from I got out of my car on arrival and got into my car on departure 
Reception was very cosy with a welcoming gas fire with modern surroundings 
Bar was comfortable with booths for privacy and also seats at bar also 
Rooms were spacious with king size bed which was executive room 
Bathroom was specious also with walk in shower and and mod cons within also deep bath also 
Had a great experience here and was central to everything 
Lots of nice restaurants and bars within walking distance 
Truly enjoyable experience",5,2016,03,07
226,stay at the FItzwilliam,"very handy to City Centre and next door to Grand Opera House. Reception staff very high standard and all staff encountered are friendly and helpful. The room was spacious and well serviced with the usual toiletries etc. Free wifi  and little touches like bottled water free gratis are nice. We found the service painfully slow in the evening. It felt like we could have gone to a show between course. Breakfast was excellent however and well served.
Would stay again ,but eat out in evening to save time.",4,2016,03,06
226,Love it will definitely come back,"Stayed for 5 nights while working over in Belfast. It is just next to the Grand Opera House, short walk to a variety of good restaurants. Quick check in and check out. Room had everything I needed including daily supply of mineral water. Requested for bedroom slippers but was out of stock. Front desk noted my request on their system and slippers arrived the very next day! Hotel supplies umbrellas too so I didn't had to worry forgetting mine. Clean, modern well kept interior and large room. Although lighting along the corridors of the floors and at the front of the rooms could be brighten up.

Highly recommended and will definitely go back again!",5,2016,03,02
226,Centrally Located.  Great Staff,"Great location to explore Belfast for a few days. Can walk to numerous historical pubs and restaurants. Is a modern hotel and seems to cater to the business crowd, but also suitable for tourists. Valet parking is available, or self park is only 1/2 block away. The concierge is very knowledgeable and helpful. He arranged a Black Cab Historical tour which I recommend.",5,2016,02,29
226,Lovely Hotel...great service,"Stayed at the hotel for two nights...the room was large and comfortable, the bed and bathroom heavenly.

The staff was wonderful and very attentive, enjoyed a meal in the bar one night which was served promptly and very nice.  Only downside was the breakfast, although a selection of continental and hot dishes was available but you will have a better fry up in a ""greasy spoon""",5,2016,02,29
226,Return stay,"We stayed in August and where not that impressed. I choose this 3 night trip as it was my anniversary weekend and the place we met you could see from the room. We checked In to our studio suite on the 8th floor it was fantastic open planned amazing double shower and free standing bath. The real credit to this hotel is the staff from the concierge to the reception and bar staff. They could not do enough to keep us happy slight hick up with Expedia and the hotel for the final night but that was all Expedia fault and the night Manager Killian was outstanding in helping me. I will rebook and recommend this hotel to anyone, great improvement on our August stay. I'm totally delighted with our three night stay and can't wait to come back! Thanks to all the staff for an memorable weekend.",5,2016,02,29
226,Great hotel,"Stayed here in a girl's weekend break and it was fantastic. Rooms were clean and a good size and lovely bathrooms and great products. Amazing shower
Breakfast was also delicious and ate in the bar and also did not dissapoint. Only downside was we asked for rooms near each other and that didn't happen but was not a biggie just would have been nice
",4,2016,02,28
226,Wonderful hotel,"Fabulous hotel, excellent staff, comfortable sleep, bathrobes, bath as well as a shower so a great 2 night stay.
Sadly, their breakfast is quite disappointing. Though continental and hot dishes are available, it was very limited.  Perhaps find alternative outside of the hotel where you will have more choice and better value.",5,2016,02,28
226,Great hotel,"A great hotel, have stayed here a few times now and would recommend it to anyone.
Rooms are great, food is lovely and in spite of it being in central Belfast, we weren't bothered by noise. Very convenient to Belfast city centre.",5,2016,02,23
226,"Service, service, service, Amazing service with a big smile","If you have a weekend in Belfast and don't really know the city, stay at the Fitzwilliam and let the concierge team look after you. Brendan booked us at James St South, recommended bars, found my lost laundry, called round for theatre tickets, made sure my new shoes got delivered and ended up in my room and generally made sure we were pointed in the right direction. Most people don't know that Brendan has tables secretly booked at most of Belfast's best restaurants so you never end up with that 'damn I wish I had booked there' glum feeling on a Friday night. Don't stay anywhere else, the rooms are funky, showers are great, the breakfast, ooooh the breakfast, great bar‚Ä¶.. I cannot find fault with anything about the hotel, cant wait to go back.",5,2016,02,22
226,Not so special valentines,"My wife and I decided to treat ourselves to a nice hotel for valentines. We had heard good things about the Fitzwilliam Hotel and thought it would be a perfect. We arrived a little after 2pm to check in but our room wasnt ready, the receptionist said that we could wait in the bar or the lobby and should only be 15 minutes. We went to the bar and waited a little over 40 minutes. When we finished our drinks, we went back to get the key to our room. It still wasnt ready, and the receptionist said we can have a drink on the house while we wait, this time it should only be another 15 minutes. When we went back way more than 15 minutes later and we were told that our room still wasnt ready. At this point it was 3.45pm, and we arrived at 2.05pm, i pointed out to the receptionist how long we had been waiting and she decided to switch our rooms so that we could get our room key. I dont know why this wasnt done in the first place, especially as there was guests that arrived after us that got to their room straight away. 
There was also problems with our room, there is a tea and coffee station by the door, we had to move the kettle to use it as there was no plug, and the packets of shortbread were opened and eaten. In the bathroom the shower gel was empty, which i found out when i went to use it in the shower. The sheets on the bed were also ripped. 

We had dinner in the restaurant which tasted lovely. Although, we were nearly finished our meal when they brought our sides. We then had to wait 45 minutes without anyone coming over to check on us or to bring our dessert. When i finally got the attention of the waitress she said that the kitchen is busy. That didnt excuse why nobody came over to check on us.

The hotel was clean and the staff were friendly, but it definitley wasnt worth ¬£200 for the night. Some might say why didnt i ring down about the problems. I already had, which were fixed and i havent noted them here because of that, but im not paying to have to ring down everytime i find something wrong! I gave the receptionist a note when checking out with everything that was wrong as i didnt want to get into it with other guests seeing... i still havent heard from the hotel!!",2,2016,02,21
226,"Lovely rooms, staff ok","The Fitzwilliam is a lovely hotel and the rooms are luxurious, so you get what you pay for. Only let down was the door man after a night out checking me off on a list and also my room key wouldn't work so I had to go down to reception twice to get a new one after 2am which wasn't ideal for a woman staying on her own...
Otherwise top hotel ",4,2016,02,21
226,Lovely hotel centre of Belfast,"Stayed for one night. Room was lovely, with a fabulous huge super kingsize bed.
Only fault i had, was the bar. You would expect some music on a Saturday night but there was none. The hotel is expensive to stay, even ""room only"".",4,2016,02,20
226,A last minute weekend in Belfast,"Staff are possibly the friendless most helpful of any hotel we have stayed in. Especially a woman who worked in the bar area. I'm afraid I never got her name but she greeted us on entering the bar last Friday the 12th and served us some drinks. (She had short, dyed red hair). All of the staff deserve credit. The room was fabulous, the breakfast was delicious and had lots of variety, and the hotel was in am excellent location. Would highly recommend.",5,2016,02,20
226,Stayed for a concert in Belfast. ,"Went to see a concert in Belfast and stayed here. We're not from far away so there wasn't a necessity for staying, but was a luxury night away. Lovely hotel, staff very friendly. The rooms are modern and nicely decorated, shower is amazing. We went for some drinks in the bar and had cocktails. There expensive but are what would be expected at this type of hotel. Nice bar and atmosphere, even if you don't eat there at least try one cocktail! Hotel is central and close to a lot of bars and restaurants ",5,2016,02,20
226,Titanic visit,I went to Belfast to visit the Titanic Museum (go there) and because it was for my 60th birthday I threw some money at it. To say that I treated myself and got it right would be an understatement this was a real Value for money Hotel loved it.,5,2016,02,18
226,Excellent Hotel,"Stayed at this hotel, excellent value for money. Room spotless, food lovely and staff extremely friendly and helpful. Excellent location for all areas of the city and easy access to tours around Northern Ireland. Would highly recommend this hotel and will be visiting again very soon ‚òòüáÆüá™üëç",5,2016,02,18
226,Top Class,"Enjoyed a one night stay here recently for business - a really comfortable, quality, understated hotel. Wonderful touches from the staff at check-in, very hospitable and welcoming overall.

Brekfast was excellent, cooked to order even despite a very large number of guests. Would highly recommend the hotel, location was excellent and food was top-notch too..

Room was very spacious and comfortable, with a large bed and spacious seating area within the standard room also. Bathroom was excellent, with both a bath and a walk-in shower.",5,2016,02,18
226,Wonderful,"We have been here 3 nights and had a very comfortable stay at a difficult time. Room fabulous, staff excellent and location perfect. Eating in restaurant tonight and all very good. Totally recommend this hotel",5,2016,02,17
226,"Overpriced , disapointing , not to be recommended","In a deluxe room ¬£230 with no breakfast , does not even compare to the Fitzwilliam in Dublin , I stayed here for my combined  birthday/wedding anniversary/ Valentines day and no effort was made to acknowledge this , plate of 3 things in the room ( not sure what they were ) Room was not particularly clean , decor was  distinctly average.Did not feel like a boutique hotel at all.Very overpriced .",1,2016,02,17
226,"Groupon voucher,  meal after show opera house","Our visit to the Fitzwilliam for a meal never disappoints.    We have tried pre theatre,  couples meal and now Groupon.    All have been super meals and great service.
it doesn't matter when we visit the staff are always very helpful.",5,2016,02,14
226,high praise  indeed,"I come from a hospitality background  so when I go to restaurants and hotels I see past all the shiny baubles and balls and look for what's really  important  and to me that is good staff who smile are welcoming and attentive and this is something  the Fitzwilliam hotel  should pride themselves on having,nothing was to much bother to them from the front off house to the kitchen staff who are often forgotten about and rarely seen yet do such a great job.my husband and I stayed over night so we had dinner  and breakfast  all the food was delicious and very well presented.my only critic would be I found the reception area dull and also the corridors very dark these areas  are not low lighting to add to the ambience of those areas  to me they are just dull nothing brighter lights or warmer  low lighting couldn't fix.we had a room on the 7th floor classical music playing when we entered  very nice,good hospitality tray along with mini bar free wifi and good coverage this is something that is lacking in a look off hotels and came in very useful . bathroom was a good size separate bath and shower and lovely  toiletries,the bedroom was a good size as well with TV and sofa all in all a 
very good stay .We most certainly will be back",5,2016,02,13
226,Well worth it...,"We had a wonderful stay at the Fitzwilliam Hotel.  We were booked in one of the corner rooms which had two solid walls of floor to ceiling windows which showcased a fantastic view of the streets and buildings below.   One great amenity the room had was its own stereo system/sound system within the closet.  That was nice to have when we were in the room relaxing after a day of walking in the city center or just playing cards before bed.   The tiled bathroom WAS AMAZING, complete with a separate shower and a deep bathtub.   It was great to have a nice soak in the tub on cold nights plus they supplied candles along the ledge (a nice touch that was well appreciated).  

The staff was very courteous and helpful.  The daily complimentary breakfast bar was well maintained and their menu options were absolutely delicious.  The lobby fireplace was great to warm up to after we got caught in the rain.  The Fitzwilliam hotel was a nice home away from home.  The room was very clean. The daily room rate was reasonable.  We would highly recommend this establishment and we will be staying here again.  ",5,2016,02,10
226,A night at the theatre,"Me and the wife stayed here last night as we where going the the grand opera house, despite a few bad reviews I thought it was a very pleasant stay, staff were friendly and courteous, food was really nice and the room was spacious and well later out, ideal if your going to the theatre, all in all a very pleasant stay. ",5,2016,02,10
226,Fantastic Hotel,"Booked a 2 night stay for my friends 40th birthday (stayed beginning of February 2016)

Check in was super and quick, and we were an hour early!

When we got to our room there was a lovely plate of treats and a chocolate message of ""Happy Birthday"" for my friend. It was a lovely surprise - THANK YOU!

Room (on 6th floor) was spacious and clean. Bathroom was again big (loved the separate shower) and spotless.

The concierge was fantastic explaining where we had to go meet our tour, booking taxis and sorting bus tour tickets. Really helpful and full of smiles every time.

Breakfast was amazing; great selection of juices, cereals, fruit,breads,muffins,pastries.....and the hot breakfast was delicious.

I really can't fault this hotel in anyway. It was both our first visit to Belfast and the hotel was the best base we could have asked for.

SUPER SUPER SUPER !!!!",5,2016,02,09
226,Ideal,"Stayed at this lovely hotel for two nights on a business trip. Executive room on the 4th floor with breakfast included. The hotel is beautifully decorated and very modern in design. From White Company toiletries, warm robes, free complementary umbrella to use throughout your stay (Needed in Belfast) delicious room service, I would return and highly recommend. Also hearing the church / cathedral bell ringing is pretty nice, sits adjacent to the hotel.   ",5,2016,02,09
226,Nice hotel,"The Fitzwilliam is a very nice and comfortable hotel
The staff are great and very attentive, polite etc
The only negative was bared wires on the hair drier which was changed in a reasonable time scale
there are bars and restaurants close by but not a great deal of choice although Deanes on Howard street is great and the Crown and Robinsons are close by
rooms are nice and bathroom of a good size 
great breakfast although we didn't go for the cooked on just continental",4,2016,02,08
226,Really nice hotel,"We stayed here for a long weekend, staff were all very friendly, rooms were spacious, hotel is in a good location close to all the sights. Lots of good bars within walking distance. Hotel has a good bar and restaurant too.",5,2016,02,08
226,Disappointing!,"I bought this one night stay, dinner bed & breakfast package as a treat as we had never experienced a 5 star hotel before. Upon arrival there was no acknowledgement from any member of staff, until checking in at the desk where we only provided with the keys and time of breakfast, and no welcome or we hope you enjoy your stay was offered.

The room was nicely decorated, but had a questionable stain in the middle of the sofa and also a previous guest had taken the time to leave the contents of their nose wiped on the base of the bed!! After a while we noticed a strange smell which we thought may have been the air conditioning, but by the time it got to late evening we discovered that in fact it was coming from the bathroom and smelt strongly of drains. We spent most of the night with the window open as we were too tired to request a room change. The shower attached to the bath had virtually no water pressure and gave nothing more than a trickle and could not be used.

The service at dinner time was very prompt between courses. I have to say the soup was nice but was lukewarm and came with 2 tiny pieces of wheaten which seemed to come straight out of the fridge. We were told the mains came with a side and chose fries but when the dinner came it already had potato with it that was not previously mentioned or else we would have ordered veg instead. The food was nothing special.

At check out we were not asked if everything was okay or if we enjoyed our stay. My wife mentioned the bad smell and was told maintenance would check it out but no apology was offered for us having to endure the smell all night. We were then asked to pay the bill despite this being pre paid 2 months ago.
A poor level of service and a disappointing view of this hotel. If this is what foreign guests are experiencing as 5 star compared to 5 star in other countries they will go away very disappointed.",3,2016,02,07
226,My Belfast home!,"This is my go-to hotel whenever I'm in Belfast and that's quite often!  I stayed here for 5 nights just over a week ago and as usual, I loved every moment of it.

The check in staff who pretty much recognise me every time I check in now, to the breakfast, the staff at breakfast and at the bar, the comfort of the rooms etc.

I really love the fact that every time I come back, I get a small plate of chocolates in my room as a welcome back!  It's like they know I love chocolate!

The only downside is the gym which I do use when I visit.. could be bigger with more floor space and equipment, and also the room service menu.  The menu has not changed for absolutely months, if not a couple of years and be nice to have something new on there.",5,2016,02,05
226,Fantastic hotel,I stayed here for a night out in Belfast and I have to say the hotel is excellent. The room was large and the bed was one of the biggest I've slept in and was very comfortable.the room had a lot of gadgets and was decorated in a very modern way. The bathroom was fantastic and the shower was excellent.the hotel reception was basic and check in was quick.the hotel bar was very busy and I would recommend the cocktails however the service was slow there is parking on-site but it is expensive however there are other car parks very close and more reasonable in price.,5,2016,02,05
226,Fantastic Honeymoon visit!,"Well this hotel really is first class!
The staff are so helpful - nothing is too much trouble.
Rooms very spacious and clean and location is very central.
We had B & B for three nights, the breakfast was delicious and the restaiurant staff were always on hand! 
Would receoment and will go back at some point! 
Thank you to you all! 

",5,2016,02,03
226,Excellent!,"Best hotel in Belfast! Stayed here for our anniversary last night for the first time and from the moment we walked in the service was first class. We paid for valet parking only ¬£17 , conceirge brought our bags to the room. Staff couldnt do enough. We stayed in Deluxe Room 602 an it was beautiful couldnt fault it at all. Big massive windows and view of the city was amazing. Loved the little extra touches in the room ie hot chocolate sachets with your tea and coffee, handmade chocolate truffles@turndown, tea light candles around the bath. Breakfast was amazing such a wide selection. We didnt want to leave and already looking at booking another stay :)",5,2016,02,02
226,Good location ,"I stayed here recently for one night in a standard room. The lobby was nice although cold but the flowers were absolutely gorgeous. They are worth going in to see alone. The hallways are very dark and the room was as well (515). The room was ok but with a view of the opposite building. The bed is lovely and big but the decor was quite plain. There were no glamorous touches. There was only one of each toiletry which was disappointing. The location is fabulous, it's right beside the Royal Opera House and The Crown and Robinsons etc. I didn't eat in the hotel so can't comment on the food,instead we went to Harlem for brunch which was lovely. ",3,2016,01,31
226,Brilliant ,"A superb hotel the concierges and all the staff are great so very attentive 
The cocktails in the bar are really good served with some crisps and nuts a nice touch
The breakfast is really good with a range on offer
Could not recommend it highly enough ",5,2016,01,30
226,Excellent Hotel,"We stayed here on a Friday night and we had a lovely stay. We arrived too early to get into our room but they stored our bags and when we came back our bags where already in our room. We had a double room with a huge bed which was very comfy. The room had. All the usual stuff Kettle, Radio, TV, sofa. The only small negative was that the TV was on the wall over the desk so was side on to the bed, not a big deal but might annoy some folk. A nice touch was the mini Cafetiere with some ""real"" coffee which was lovely and enough for 2 cups. The room also had a mini bar whjich we didn't use. Bathroom was big with towels etc. The WiFi was fantastic and super fast. We didn't have breakfast in they Hotel but we did have drinks in the bar after being out on the town. The Bar is very nice and not cheap but I guess you would expect that. Its in a very handy location, close to town centre and the golden mile. If you are staying go across the road to the Crown bar which is fantastic. ",4,2016,01,30
226,Fantastic customer service ,"Me and my fiance stayed here for our 1st anniversary and without asking the hotel upgraded our stay with lots of little extras that ment the world to us and made our stay soo special and we'll never forget what a brilliant 1st year anniversary we had.... the staff were so friendly and helpful and the food was brilliant...  

Would highly recommend... excellent value!!... 
Will be back for sure ",5,2016,01,29
226,Good hotel in the center of town,"This hotel was nice and had all the necessities for a business traveler. WiFi was fine. Location was very good. Only 15 minutes to Belfast City Airport. Nice toiletries in the bathroom. Bed was comfortable and noise level in the room was quiet. Only thing that they could improve on is breakfast hours. Breakfast was included with my room, however, they don‚Äôt start breakfast until 7:00am which makes it difficult to eat and still make a 8:30am flight (which there are several out of Belfast City). Most hotels I‚Äôve been to start breakfast at 6:00am. If you have an early flight, don‚Äôt plan on having time to enjoy the breakfast at the hotel. Other than that, a fine choice for downtown Belfast.",4,2016,01,28
226,Very disappointing!!,"Stayed here on a Saturday night after shopping and dinner. Looking forward to a relaxing getaway but was very disappointed on checking in. Our Executive room was very small, although contemporary decor was nice. TV had no terrestrial channels and stereo had only one station, but the BIGGEST problem was the noise!! Double aspect windows with very poor sound proofing meant the constant road noise was deafening! When asked to be moved to a quieter room we were told they were fully booked.  The noise only disapiated slightly as the night wore on with sirens and horns hooting continuously into the early hours. This was only compacted with a chiming town clock across the street which played a chiming tune every 15mins! This stopped at 9pm but began bright and early on Sun morning at 9am again- bang goes a lazy Sunday morning  lie in in this hotel!! Very disappointed with our stay here and sorry to say I would never consider making reservations here again.",1,2016,01,28
226,"Beautiful hotel, central location","Very comfy bed, nice spacious room, friendly and helpful staff, lovely decor and all areas spotless and well maintained. Excellent location for walking to lots of sights, shopping and great places to eat and drink. Shower was disappointing, water pressure not great.",4,2016,01,26
226,Gorgeous!,"Stayed here for one night... absolutely loved it!! Friendly an helpful staff, central to shops bars etc... maybe a tad expensive but for a treat I could not recommend it highly enough! Beautiful hotel! ",5,2016,01,26
226,Lovely stay at the fitzwilliam,"I reserved one of the beautiful corner rooms for my husband and I when we were having a night out in Belfast, it was a stunning room, everything was very clean, and staff were so friendly I'd definitely stay again",5,2016,01,25
226,Would highly recommend ,"We really enjoyed our stay at The Fitzwilliam. The location was ideal. The staff were super friendly and helpful, without exception. Our room was a good size and very comfortable. The bed was very confirms je and the black out curtains were a god send! Would definitely stay at The Fitzwilliam again :) ",5,2016,01,25
226,Good central hotel,"Good sized room (superior King) and bathroom, but disappointing view from floor. Massive comfy bed. I had a few issues with room temperature and quality of TVs (old) but manageress Victoria recovered things roses signally to my satisfaction.
Breakfast was generally good but could be improved by offering more lighter options eg simple boiled egg and soldiers, or scrambled eggs on toast.
Concentrated juices were horrible.
We booked private giants causeway and city tours through the hotel. Our driver Dan was excellent; his knowledge of the political issues was especially good.",4,2016,01,24
226,Our stay at the Fitzwilliam hotel Belfast,"Had a lovely nights stay in the Fitzwilliam for our anniversary. Our room was very nice, the hotel is close 2 all amenities in Belfast city centre. We had breakfast which was of a very high standard & the staff are all very friendly a big thank you 2 Philip the concierge who was very helpful on helping us out with places 2 visit in Belfast. Brilliant experience can't wait for our next visit",5,2016,01,24
226,"Classy, good value for money and great staff","I went to Belfast for a couple of days with my sister for her birthday, I only mentioned this briefly and the lady was finding us a room to upgrade to! 
This interior was gorgeous and it felt like a spa treatment just being there.  It was so worth it to pay a little extra for a great and memorable stay.",5,2016,01,23
226,A little slow,"I and a friend had a pre-theatre dinner. The South African wine was good, but the dinner was of moderate quality. Portions quite small, and service rather slow so that we were really worried about whether or not we would be in time for the performance. ",3,2016,01,23
226,"My Stay At ""The Fitzwilliam Hotel""","We arrived at my favourite city centre hotel ""The Fitzwilliam"" yesterday 21.01.2016 and were greeted by the friendly, welcoming attentive front of house team and the then the  ever efficient  Lauren, Melony and their team when we relaxed in the bar  following our check in. Our bedroom suite on the 8th floor was amazing and sheer luxury. My sister and I were in Belfast to attend an event however, we found it very difficult  to leave the luxury and comfort of our suite and would been quite content to spend our evening in..  The presentation and high standard of  food beverages, and overall quality of ""The Fitzwilliam""were excellent and made our stay most enjoyable hence our 5* Rating...We look forward to a return visit very soon. Sadie McAuley....",5,2016,01,22
226,So disappointed.,"Firstly I would like to point out this review is purely about the restaurant!
My husband & I had been given a gift voucher for a meal & decided to use it tonight as we were going to the theatre next door. We had a table booked for 6-15pm as the show started at 8pm.We had our order taken reasonably quickly and got our starter ok ,after 45mins still no main course .I had mentioned it to passing staff 3 times.At 7-25pm just as we were getting up to leave when meal arrived cold .At  this stage we gave up to leave.I asked for the Manager and that was their own saving grace as he was most apologetic and said this wasn't normal told us to keep the voucher and hopefully we would be happier next time .This was our first visit and only for the way the Manager dealt with our complaint we would never be back. We will give it another chance & if it comes up to standard I will review again.",2,2016,01,21
226,Beautiful hotel,"Stayed here for a night on a work trip. Lovely spacious rooms, beautifully appointed and quiet. The hotel is in a good central location. Big comfy bed, and lRge walk in shower with lovely white company toiletries.",5,2016,01,21
226,Excellent Stay,"Our 3rd time staying at the Fitzwilliam, and it didn't disappoint.  It has to be my favourite hotel in Belfast.  Staff and Concierge team are very friendly and helpful.  Rooms are lovely and spacious with again spacious bathrooms.  Beds and bedding are very comfortable.  The style of the Fitzwilliam does not disappoint, with its elegance and hints of Art Deco styling. Very handy and central to the town and the sights.  Definitely will be back.",5,2016,01,21
226,Good but lacking something...,An overnight business stay. Dinner was good but the restaurant was quiet and lacking ambience. Breakfast was less successful. A good selection but the food was overly salted and very plain. Coffee was good! The room had a bit of character and front of house was efficient. But given it wasn't one of the big chains it felt as though they were playing safe - and lost something in the process.,3,2016,01,20
226,Another great visit!,"We got the New Year's Eve package this year and it didn't disappoint ! The rooms are beautiful , cocktails are fab and the 4 course dinner was great! Staff are lovely & the late check out and breakfast went down a treat! Would recommend to everyone!!",5,2016,01,14
226,Lovely!,"Stayed one night on business. Knew I was in for a treat when I walked in to classic fm playing on the stereo in my room and the TV welcoming me by name. Not rocket science, but lovely. Great big room - all the trimmings and really helpful staff. Great central location and really plush decor. Can't wait to return. ",5,2016,01,13
226,Excellent!,"I stayed here for two nights in December and everything was brilliant. The room was lovely, clean, fresh and had everything we needed. The staff were great and really friendly. Recommend to anyone! :)",5,2016,01,12
226,Two night birthday break.,"I booked a suite here for two nights as a birthday surprise. There were some nice nibbles and birthday message provided by the hotel, a nice touch to the room. Staff were friendly and happy to help. Suites are spacious, with double sinks and a double shower head wet room (the showers could have been a little more powerful).

Hotel is central and up there with other high star options in the city. Only reason for 4 stars rather than 5 was the disappointing breakfast buffet / selection. Save your money and book room only, there are plenty of good breakfast spots in the city.",4,2016,01,07
226,Total Five Star Experience,"Stayed overnight on the 2.1.16 for a New Year birthday treat.  The room was sheer luxury. A beautiful King-size bed was complimented by lovely heavy curtains and soft furnishings.  The bathroom was class and I really enjoyed the super-soaker shower.

We had an early - evening meal in the restaurant in addition to the included breakfast.  The food was of exceptional high-quality.  The restaurant staff were excellent and a joy to engage with.  Nothing too much bother.  My wife and I loved every bit of the experience and will be anxious to return agaiin.

 I suppose it is priced at the higher end of the market but it is worth it!",5,2016,01,05
226,Stylish,"Visit this hotel for the first time. Very welcoming staff and lovely surroundings. Check in was quick and room was fabulous.We selected a meal package deal and it was excellent value for money as the food was very well presented and of high quality.
Staff in the hotel are all very keyed into customer service and it was present no matter where you were in the hotel.
Will definitely stay here again when next in Belfast. Location and car parking very convenient.",5,2016,01,05
226,Glad I wasn't paying full price,"The fist time myself and my partner stayed here we stayed in an executive room for 2 nights the executive rooms are nice and spacious with big comfy double beds a big sofa and an ensuite with separate bath and shower although there where a few issues with our room, the fitzwilliam boasts spectacular views of the city which aren't so spectacular when you can't see through the window because the condensation on it is so thick it forms a small puddle on the floor, the shower door didn't close properly, there was a hole in one of the dressing gowns provided, the TV's are like something from the stone ages, there was no breakfast card provided to order breakfast in bed, and breakfast was late. But breakfast was one of the best breakfasts we've had in a long time all in all some minor faults but you'd expect more from a 4 star hotel. I decided to book us in again for Sunday the 3rd of January into one of you're deluxe rooms as part of my other halves Christmas present, I phoned on Saturday to ask how much an upgrade to a suite would be as an extra treat and to my surprise it was complimentary, great!As always the girls at reception where lovely and on first impressions the room was lovely too despite the wobbly toilet, and not being able to get the bath plug out, one of our sinks also blocked up which staff did thankfully quickly rectify while we where out. We ordered breakfast in bed and selected for it to be brought up between 10-10.30 around 9.30 my other half nipped out  for the paper and at 9.40 the door went so I jumped out of bed and opened the door in my somewhat revealing pjs expecting my partner to be met by a waiter who looked as equally surprised as I was awkward and there was no toast which we had ordered but which was again quickly rectified. Breakfast was no where near as good as it was on our previous stay and we where both left disappointed at a ¬£44 breakfast so I did complain about this and it was completely taken off the bill so all in all I paid ¬£135 for a suite and breakfast in bed which I think is about all it was worth and the staff are obviously very used to complaints for them to be rectified so easily with no questions asked and although our complaints where dealt with incredibly well by very commendable staff I will from now on be taken my money elsewhere. Not worth 4 stars. ",2,2016,01,04
226,Visit site seeing,"The hotel is very very clean and friendly 
Slippers and guest robes I would stay there again in a heart beat   The whole hotel staff is a one and so friendly great restaurant lovely sweet hotel   They don't make places like this anymore",5,2016,01,03
226,birthday treat for my partner.,"I booked the winter warmer package as a birthday treat for my fiancee. The room was stunning with a free standing bath which my partner loved. Their was an issue with the television which was quickly resolved by the concierge( an aerial wire adjustment). The 4 course meal was beautiful and with exceptional service by our waiter and thx again for the recommendations as my partner is a coeliac, nothing was to much trouble for him. Breakfast the next morning was again lovely and well presented. I could not fault this hotel and would return.",5,2015,12,31
226,Perfect Fitz,"Awesome room, stayed in a suite with a shower room, massive bath, bathrobes etc.Excellent staff, very attentive. Great location, 2 minutes into city centre, lots of pubs ant eating places close by. Great food in the restaurant. Worth that little bit extra. Will definitely return!",5,2015,12,30
226,Not worth the money ,Having just had a baby my husband took me here for my birthday.  The check in staff were lovely and very helpful. Both lifts have cracked mirrors and broken lights/shades.  The room was clean and neat however the light switch came off in my hand.  We ordered room service as a treat it was a very expensive treat I ordered a chicken lettuce and tomato sandwich when it arrived there was no tomato so it was very dry.  Then we turned on the tv the only channels we could get were the rte channels and cnn and a French news channel.  The bed was very firm not to my taste and the traffic outside was very loud in our room we actually thought the window was open which it wasn't.. Over all it was an ok visit I don't think il be returning. But staff were very helpful.,1,2015,12,29
226,Great place for a city break,"I am sure this is a business hotel during the working week but as a break it is well located and has good service as well as great rooms.  Staff are great as well. Good location,  ask for higher floors at the back if you are a light sleeper",5,2015,12,29
226,Nice Hotel But Service Was Poor,"My wife and I booked in for a couple of nights to celebrate a birthday and were pleased with the check in and standard of the room. Decor and facilities where good. 
We asked for some champagne flutes and an ice bucket which arrived promptly although I couldn't get through to the main desk and had to call the bar directly.
On our return to the hotel we stopped in the bar for a nightcap but where unable to get an Irish Coffee as the coffee machine was turned off so we ordered something else and sat down to enjoy our drink. After a couple of minutes the barman told us he was closing the bar and we would have to take our drinks to the lobby. We duly carried our drinks to the lobby which was cold, the gas flame fire was turned off and generally not a pleasant or comfortable place for a nightcap so we just had to head back to our room.
The following day I went out to meet some friends while my wife was getting ready in the room. The hairdryer wasn'y working in the room so she called reception and they sent another one up fairly promptly, unfortunately the other hairdryer wasn't working as well and when she called reception they told my wife to hold the line while they contacted housekeeping, After waiting for 5 minutes, the line went dead and the hairdryer never appeared. My wife had to give up waiting and go out with her hair still wet as we had a dinner appointment. 
We left the next day without any explanation or apology. 
Very poor service for a hotel which is trying to market itself as top class.",2,2015,12,29
226,NOT the most often bombed hotel in Belfast (that would be the Europa),"Lovely hotel. If you can figure out the weird totally over-engineered lighting, the staff and hotel stay were all lovely. A belated but heartfelt thanks to all the complicated help (locating political party headquarters) we got from Gerard (Gerry), Philip, Dermot and Declan as well as to Tour guide Francie who works with the hotel and can give a wonderful and authoritative tour of Belfast. A great city to visit. ",5,2015,12,26
226,Business trip in Belfast,"Nice hotel in Belfast city center. Breakfast and accomodation up to the best international standards. Not far from Robinson's and The Crown Bar, two old Irish pubs with a bookmaker shop in between for a Guinness.",4,2015,12,26
226,Lovely hotel,"Just back from an excellent stay at the Fitzwilliam.  We booked a deluxe double room, which was spacious and tastefully decorated.  It was not cheap, but worth it.  The bed was comfy, the bathroom large with separate tub and rainfall shower and big bath towels, great view from floor to ceiling windows, excellent location, nice selection of toiletries which were replaced daily, friendly and helpful staff, nice little touches like candles and chocolates for turndown service, A.C. available even in winter (very rare in European hotel which are usually boiling hot in the winter).  There is a bustling bar scene so avoid the lower floors on the weekend.  Also, the lighting isn't great.  Not normally a concern, but applying makeup was a challenge.  We only tried the internet in the business center and it was terrible.  The drawers in the nightstand are too tiny for pjs and they definitely need more shelf space in the bathroom.  Otherwise, a perfect stay.",5,2015,12,23
226,Another warm stay,"Once again a great stay in a grand hotel. Staff exceptionally friendly and helpful.

The room was fabulous, nice and spacious and cleaned to perfection.

A large bathroom with a shower and separate bathtub (very large bathtub too I might add) made the stay all the more pleasant.

The breakfast here is worthy of an award. Possibly the best breakfast I've had in a hotel. The three egg omlette are cooked to perfection every morning without fail and the Irish fry is exceptional. Without a doubt the highlight of my stay here.",5,2015,12,20
226,Exceptional service,"We stayed here for four nights in December. I called the hotel the day before as we were arriving by very early so I aided if we'd be able to check in early. It was no trouble and the staff couldn't be more accommodating. We had our room by 0930 which although was a know accessible room which we didn't need, it was more than suitable and beautifully equipped. Every time we asked the staff any thing they couldn't be more helpful. Even trying to find somewhere I could get my nails done at short notice! Brilliant! I'd definitely go back! ",5,2015,12,17
226,Wonderful weekend!,"Great hotel for it's proximity to wonderful Restaurants and Bars. The staff were very friendly and accommodating. Room and bed very comfortable. Our second time to stay at the Hotel and both times very enjoyable.
A great city!",5,2015,12,17
226,Great Hotel in centre of Belfast,"Stayed 2 nights recently and was impressed,location excellent for accessing centre of Belfast.Rooms very high standard,we were on 7th floor in executive room with king size bed,very comfortable and spotlessly clean.Special mention of the concierge staff who couldn't,t do enough for you,very helpful indeed!!in particular Dermot,Philip and Gerard who were most helpful.
one thing though the advertised valet car service is only a parking service and not a valet service which is misleading, at ¬£15 per day one would expect at least a car wash!!! All in all would recommend this hotel and we will return.",4,2015,12,16
226,A very pleasant stay,"Hotel receptionist very welcoming concierge  took care of my car and luggage,room was excellent .I thought we had super king size bed turned out to be two singles pushed together but very comfortable had dinner in bar food good but a bit noisy lots of xmas parties going on breakfast very good,on checking out was able to leave my car in hotel car park to do a bit shopping after a quiet word with concierge.",4,2015,12,15
226,Cut above the rest!,"Stylish, comfortable  and so central! Very close to bus and train station. Lots of restaurants  and convenience stores close-by. Staff very pleasant,  friendly and helpful. Rooms well equipped and very glamourous. Will definitely  be back!!",5,2015,12,15

226,Not what I expected from a 5-star hotel,"I stayed here on Friday 11th with a friend. I have to say for being the Fitzwilliam I wasn't overly impressed.

When we arrived the staff were very helpful and friendly. We got checked into out hotel with no hassle at all.

We made our way up to our executive room on the 5th floor. Our room was clean and tidy and seemed to have everything that we needed. It was however very small, there were dirty marks on the wall and the TV was something that you would expect to see in a 2* hotel. The remote didn't even have a cover over the batteries. 
The view wasn't the best but we didn't care about that.

On my confirmation email from the hotel I was told that we would have a iPod docking station but when we arrived in the room there was so sign of one. There was a radio with a cassette player - yes a cassette player! I rang down to reception to find out about this and was told that it was removed from the room. The girl who I was speaking to said that she would see if she could try and get us one and that she would call us back. We never got that call back! Don't get me wrong, it really didn't matter if we had a docking station but the fact that I was told in my email there would be one and that no one call me back was disappointing.

As we missed lunch that day we ordered a chip up to the room and it cost us ¬£7, which included the room service charge which we expected. However, the serving was like something you would get from McDonalds!!

My friend and I went out in Belfast for the night and arrived back to the hotel about 1.30am. We had planned to go to the residents bar for a quick night cap before bed but we were informed that the residents bar had closed for the night.

The next morning I went to boil the kettle and had to use a torch to see because the lights were so hard to use. After playing about for 30+ minutes I realised there was a dimmer switch but this switch was in the room beside the beds! Maybe this is me being silly but I would expect this to be beside the actual light switch. I then had to set the kettle on the carpeted floor to boil it as there was a shortage of plugs in the room! When it was boiling the lid kept opening!

I checked out at about 11.30am and they staff were again very helpful and friendly.

I really expected more from this hotel and was very disappointed as this is a 5-star hotel and holds such a high reputation. ",3,2015,12,14
226,Great place to stay in Belfast,"This is our 2nd time here.  Great staff, very friendly. Comfortable bed and room plus the bathroom is fantastic. Love the rain head shower and deep bathtub.  Close to everything.  I love the decor too. 

We both highly recommend it. The bar is nice and they make a great Cosmo. We tried the restaurant on our previous trip and thought it was very good and we are experienced fine diners. ",5,2015,12,14
226,A wonderful hotel,"I love Belfast, the people are so friendly and The Fitzwilliam hotel seems to have the best of them.  We didn't stay there, as it was fully booked but we ate there every day of our trip.  The food is great, a blend of traditional Irish with contemporary, all beautifully prepared and presented.  Despite being very busy with large parties celebrating Christmas, the staff remained very friendly.  One in particular stood out, a 'wee' girl named Hannah, she could not do enough for us.  All and all it was a brilliant weekend.  Thank you.",5,2015,12,14
226,`A Christmas Blast`,"Stayed Saturday night , in an executive suite and used their parking services. From our arrival to our departure,  all the staff were courteous, friendly and helpful. 
The room was well equipped, clean and modern with good facilities. We were on the 7th floor, with view to the rear of the hotel,, no noise at all. View was poor, though.
We had not booked anywhere for a meal and used the bar menu. The bar room was busy with both diners and persons in for a drink. I spoke with one of the supervising staff, namely Megan, (I believe), she was very helpful and informative. Taking into consideration how busy, she he afford us time and attempted to source a booth for dining but was unable to do so, but swiftly set up our table for food and delivered same within minutes. ..(as if they were waiting on us) Excellent food and service. 
Great location for experiencing Belfast shopping and the buzzing night life.
Our booking in and departure was quick and hassle free, thanks to Ashleigh, reception desk.
Great stay, thanks.",5,2015,12,13
226,Daylight robbery,"I feel as if I have been robbed in broad daylight. I took my mother and two children to the restaurant  for a pre theatre dinner. I was told on the phone  that the two course meal would cost ¬£20 but they didn't  tell you that if you wanted  vegetables  with your meal it would cost an extra ¬£3.50 for each side order. My two children  had chicken  bites  and skinny fries from the children's  menu. My mother had one glass of white wine costing ¬£7.50, how can they  even justify  that? Soft drinks cost ¬£2.50.  The total  bill for 2 adults  and 2 children  came to ¬£99.50 and the standard  of the food wasn't  that good. Definitely would never return. We had gone out  the night before  in my home town, there were 6 of us we had  starter's  main course, dessert and three bottles of wine and the bill came to ¬£175 but was worth  it. This definitely  wasn't!",1,2015,12,12
226,One of the best places to stay in Belfast,Reception staff are very friendly and polite so you feel welcome from the moment you arrive. Nicely decorated spacious and well equipped rooms. Nice relaxing bar with waiter service. Good choice of buffet and cook to order Irish breakfast.,5,2015,12,12
226,"Good stay at this hotel, location sells it.","We try to visit Belfast in December every year and usually stay in the Fitzwilliam. We stayed here last weekend. Check-in was easy and straightforward. We booked our car for car parking and were greeted on arrival by friendly staff. Our room was nice. Not one of the better rooms I have stayed in. We got a good deal at ¬£80 for the night, to be honest I'd have been slightly disappointed if we'd paid anymore. Room was clean and pleasant however our window looked straight into another room so our curtains had to remain closed at all times - not ideal. We had no remote control for our TV. When I went to use a wine glass for water I discovered it wasn't clean - when I lifted the other glass it was dirty too. Not a major factor but they are small details that do affect your stay. Bathroom was lovely and clean, our shower didn't feel very powerful and I actually decided it would be easier to wash the shampoo off my hair by using the hose from the bath - bad idea.. there was a large spilt at the top of our hose in the bath which sent water everywhere. Location is a selling point for this hotel.. leave the hotel and walk straight a very short distance and you're at city hall which is great for the markets or some shopping. Only a short walk to many restaurants. 
I'm not entirely sure if we'd stay again. It is a lovely hotel but unfortunately these minor details from our stay took away from it slightly.",4,2015,12,11
226,Again :),"This is my 4th or 5th time to stay there, good place and location for business travelers in the heart of the city, the rooms start to need some renovation as it is getting old, but overall it is still good, breakfast was perfect even with a limited choices, free wifi was great and speedy :)",4,2015,12,11
226,Not too shabby,"Just spent a weekend in Belfast with another couple, and chose to stay here after a recommendation.
The reception staff, including the concierge & bell boys were very friendly and welcoming. Check in was very quick & efficient.
We stayed in executive rooms. Whilst the decor was not to my taste, the rooms were spotless & very comfortable. Every extra that you might expect from this class of hotel was provided; robes, slippers, brolly, safe, real iron & board, safe etc.
The bathroom spacious & modern with both a full size bath & large shower, toiletries from The White Company were a nice touch.
Breakfast was adequate, good service & prompt but my tea was served luke warm on Sunday.
The cocktail bar was very busy on Saturday with tables occupied by teenagers ( their parents were at another table), they weren't drinking & I personally would have encouraged them to vacate a little earlier.. We returned later and a lovely lady secured us a table quickly.
Cocktails were nice but actually cheaper at the beautiful Europa next door.
Check out again, very quick and efficient.
Good break, nice hotel with great staff.
Not sure I'd return, but purely as the modern decor wasn't to my personal taste.
",4,2015,12,08
226,"Great location, excellent service ","Enjoyed a short visit at the weekend and was impressed with this hotel.  It really is ideally located for a visit to the Christmas markets and main shopping areas with some great bars and restaurants in the immediate vicinity.  

The staff are all lovely and the rooms well equipped, spotless and very comfortable.  Excellent bathrooms, very clean and modern, a stylish hotel overall.  It has a good bar and gorgeous fire in the lobby which is very inviting.  Will definitely return.

",4,2015,12,06
226,One of Belfast's best hotels,"This was our second time staying at the Fitzwilliam Belfast and just like the first time this time was great.

Great service, helpful staff and lovely clean rooms.

Ideally located for the city centre this hotel must be in the top 3!

Cocktail bar is great and the mixologists are at the top of their game. 

Super hotel ",5,2015,12,05
226,Almost perfection,"For less than ¬£100 I had a big double upgraded room with settee and everything I could possibly need. Everyone was laid back and whatever we needed we could have. The staff were friendly and professional and made everything easy. I sat around downstairs having an informal meeting and we were left in peace, until we needed coffee, which was soon sorted. A high level of comfort and a feeling of being looked after made this a super base to explore Belfast. It was central and round the corner from the airport bus terminal. Be warned though that if you ask for a paper, there is a delivery charge. 60p turned into ¬£1.50, which I have never come across before. However, as I queried it, they promptly took it off the bill and I got my paper free. Next time I come to belfast I will be staying here for sure. ",5,2015,12,05
226,Lovely hotel and great location,"Recently we stayed at the Fitzwilliam for 2 nights while on a brief visit to Belfast. We were very impressed. Our room was large, clean and tastefully decorated. The staff were friendly and accommodating and we loved the location which allowed us to walk to the Titanic exhibit and the Crumlin Road Gaol. It was so handy to have the bus station just a few steps away. This enabled us to get back and forth to the airport very easily.",5,2015,11,30
226,Weekend in Belfast.,Just back from an excellent weekend in Belfast staying at the Fitzwilliam Hotel. The accommodation was excellent and service the same. Special mention to Philip the concierge who couldn't have been more helpful and also to Lauren the bar manager and Lorraine bar staff for the great service. Overall this is a really nice hotel with a good atmosphere nice restaurant and bar. Would definitely recommend this hotel and its location for all amenities. Belfast is a great place to visit full of life and lovely friendly people !,5,2015,11,30
226,Practically perfect in every way,"Just come back from an amazing 2 night stay at The Fitzwilliam. Staff were friendly and helpful. Room was beautiful, bed comfy and even got a turn down service with chocolates! Had cocktails at the bar both nights with complimentary nibbles. Cocktails were all fantastic and staff only too happy to help even though it was very busy both nights. Great location for all things in an around the city center. Even had a umbrella in the room which was a life saver on a rainy weekend.",5,2015,11,30
226,A top stay in Belfast!,"Stayed at this property for a couple of nights, very handy location, only a couple of blocks from the Belfast City Hall.  Very friendly staff on reception, and great bar to watch Ireland vs. France in the rugby.  Very nice room with a comfortable bed.  Fitness room a little on the small side, but sufficient to keep those holiday calories in check.  Would stay here again.",5,2015,11,28
226,Fitzwilliam hotel Beds,Stayd last night. Orderd a double room & ended up with two single beds joint togeather & two matress zipd togeather on the beds. Was not happy with the the beds at all. Only downfall we had other than that hotel is amazing. But will not be back after the beds & not a thing was done about it. Not one bit happy at all. Any other hotel its a proper double or king matress on the bed. It should have been stated at time of booking but was not.,2,2015,11,28
226,Great hotel for business,"I try to stay at the Fitzwilliam whenever I'm in town for business. It's very central - close to many shops and restaurants. They tend to book out very fast or the rates shoot up. 
The rooms are clean and well equipped. There is wifi available. Some rates include breakfast - full buffet with option to order from the kitchen for omelettes and/or pancakes.",4,2015,11,27
226,Top 1 or 2 in Belfast,"Smaller boutique hotel type fare, great staff, great bar, great breakfast (buffet + a la carte), nice rooms with comfy beds. Good location. Stayed many times, default choice for Belfast. I've yet to try Merchant but until then this is my top pick for Belfast. To improve: fitness room a bit small, one of the rooms I stayed in had a slightly loose window handle i.e. a  bit more ambient noise.",5,2015,11,26
226,And still the best hotel in Belfast!,"Another great stay at the Fitzwilliam. Really friendly and helpful staff at front of house, and in the bar and restaurant. The room was as ever very clean, modern and colourful, with some nice touches like free WiFi, iron and ironing board, bottled spring water, biscuits, as well as tea, coffee & hot chocolate. The food in the restaurant was great - I can recommend the Christmas turkey with trimmings (nice seasonal dish), followed by Christmas pudding. All in all, a great nights stay and I shall definitely be coming back!",5,2015,11,26
226,Very Nice stay,"Only spent one night here recently but great hotel,only let down really is the parking being a distance away from the hotel and the carpark they send you to is always full so you have to wait about for a space!",5,2015,11,24
226,Birthday treat,Room was out of this world.  Stayed in the deluxe room. Loved the views. Bed so comfy. Excellent room. We stayed for lazy Sunday which included dinner and breakfast.  Dinner was 4 course one of the courses is tea and coffee. Was very very disappointed in the dinner service. Not great choice pea soup was tasteless. Steak was just ok certainly not mouth watering. Chips were cheap chips and sides was boiled potatoes and veg. Which to me doesn't go with chips. Didn't stay for tea and coffee. We had breakfast in our room and it was lovely. We will definitely be staying again in fact we have booked again for May to stay in same room. But we will be having dinner elsewhere. ,4,2015,11,23
226,Family overnight,"Booked two rooms for the family for a Sunday through to Monday. No special occasion other than to enjoy the Christmas Continental Market, some shopping and Belfast. Therefore had wanted a centrally placed hotel within walking distance of shops, eateries etc.  this certainly is. Arrived a little early for checkin but this was not a problem as reception staff checked in our bags which were then waiting in our rooms when we returned. Used the valet parking which was stress free for us. Quite expensive but saved us the hassle of finding a parking space etc.  the rooms were as advertised and as seen in the photographs. Spacious with a very comfortable king sized bed and the usual amenities. Cafe de terry for proper coffee was welcomed.  Had a strawberry daiquiri on room service..reasonably priced however ¬£7 room service charge was a little extorinate I thought.  The cocktail was really good though!
Wil certainly consider it again for a Belfast break.",4,2015,11,23
226,An enjoyable stay,"We had a very pleasant stay at the Fitzwilliam this weekend. The location is excellent-very close to everything and perfect for heading out for a stroll around the city centre. Our room was a deluxe corner king and was lovely-nice decor and spacious and bright with large windows overlooking the streets below. There was some traffic noise but this is to be expected in a city centre hotel. Bathroom was spotlessly clean. Room temperature was very pleasant and also easily controlled which isn't always the case in hotel rooms. WiFi was excellent. The bed was really comfortable, as were the pillows and I am very fussy about pillows! Breakfast was good and the wait staff on duty were very friendly and efficient. We ate one evening meal in the hotel restaurant and this is where I would mark it down as it was mediocre at best and definitely not up to the standard one would expect from a hotel of this category. In all other regards the hotel met our expectations and I would recommend it but with the proviso that you'd be better off dining elsewhere in the evenings in one of the many fab restaurants Belfast has to offer.",4,2015,11,22
226,Spacious accommodation in central location  ,"My husband and I stayed here on a Thursday night just before Halloween. Our greeting at reception was very warm. We stayed in a de luxe twin room. Whilst the decor was a little garish in colour it did all feel nicely stylish. A candle and matches in the bathroom was a nice touch. Overall the bathroom was one of the best things about our accommodation. We were a little underwhelmed by the hotel bar which was lacking in atmosphere and the bar snacks a tiny bit stale. However, it was very exciting to be sharing the bar with half a dozen Game of Thrones actors! Breakfast the next morning was very good despite them repeatedly forgetting our requests for toast. Concierge staff were charming. 
We had a lovely time and would return but stay longer in The Crown Bar across the road next time! 
",4,2015,11,22
226,"Nice stay, would visit again","Stayed here for two nights while seeing U2 in Belfast recently. Overall a lovely stay. Checkin was very painless, and the location of the hotel makes it easy to reach when driving into Belfast as well within walking distance of all the city centre amenities. Staff were quite pleasant in general and the room was lovely, spacious and with modern decor. The reception area is also very pleasant with a nice modern fire roaring against one of the walls. Breakfast in bed was really tasty, but we got chicken wings as a snack on one of the nights and it was very disappointing - tasteless breadcrumb covering tasteless wings, wouldn't order that again. I also used the valet parking and it was a little expensive at 17 pounds a day - I would factor that into my comparison with the price of other Belfast hotels in the future. However, if you're looking for a little bit of luxury at reasonable prices right in the heart of Belfast I would recommend staying here. ",4,2015,11,22
226,"Great hotel, great location","The hotel is more or less in the centre of town  (bear in mind that Belfast isn't particularly big). We spent 1 night here when we went to the U2 concert. 

The hotel room was lovely - clean and looked very new (not sure when they refurbished last). The deco was very modern with great colours. The bathroom was fabulous large with a bath and shower. 

The bar was great and reasonably priced drinks.

The service overall was terrific and all in all a great hotel. Would definitely recommend ",5,2015,11,22
226,Overnight.,"I am so impressed with this hotel. Amazing staff, excellent food, brilliant atmosphere, the nicest cocktails I this city and our room was beautiful. The location is also perfect. Choose one of the corner deluxe rooms. Excellent views over the city. 
",5,2015,11,20
226,A very welcoming hotel .,"Very friendly staff. Lovely breakfast and well located for bus station. A bus runs regularly from airport to the bus station , a few hundred yards from the hotel . We had a very enjoyable stay. Don't expect a good view from the window. Not really important for a city break at end of October. It was dark when we arrived and dark and rainy when we left.",5,2015,11,19
226,Over-Night Stay.,"Pleasant stay, room very comfortable and clean, corridor quite dark, dinning area tastefully decorated, cooked breakfast delicious, staff polite and helpful.
Hotel so convenient to high street shops,restaurants,and landmarks.
One down side............smokers at door entrance.
Would definitely go back again.",4,2015,11,18
226,Cannot wait to return!!,"My boyfriend and I stayed here for 2 nights in November. Everything was perfect from start to finish. The receptionist was very friendly and helpful. The hallway and our room were very dark but this didn't bother us at all. We had an executive king room and it was gorgeous and the bed was AMAZING!! The room was perfect. I honestly cannot wait to stay here again! We paid for parking for the 2 nights which was ¬£17 a day, I do think this was a bit over the top but we needed the parking.",5,2015,11,18
226,Always comfortable and helpful,"I have stayed here before for short business trips and as ever I find this a very good hotel.

A good central location, well appointed  rooms and most of all friendly and helpful staff. 

The breakfast is good and any requests to reception or restaurant staff are dealt with quickly.

Keep it up!",5,2015,11,18
226,Business Trip,"Lovely hotel, where all the staff I found where very helpful and polite. The room was very spacious and clean, the bed extremely comfy, with all the things you would need. I stayed for one night, and also had the breakfast where I found the service extremely slow, I found waiters where clearing/tiding empty tables when there were plenty of clean tables for new guest over taking breakfast orders from tables that had been waiting for a while. When the breakfast did arrive it was very high quality and I appreciate the effort taken by the chef to ensure everything I had was dairy free.
Overall I would stay again if coming for work and also if I was visiting with my partner. ",4,2015,11,18
226,"Great hotel, will stay again","I recently stayed in the Fitzwilliam a Hotel for a 1 night business trip. I have stayed in a few hotels in Belfast and this one is my favourite by far. I will be staying here again. Good good, good breakfast, decent size rooms with a good bathroom. Very clean and really comfy beds which I find is something rare. Very impressed with the comfy bed. Overall I would strongly recommend staying here. I arrived earlier than anticipated but they found me a room so I could work. You would have no regrets booking this hotel. ",5,2015,11,18
226,Totally up and beyond,"I found my self needing to exchange us dollars for pounds on a sat night after all banks and bureau de change were closed. Walked maybe four or five miles looking for a hotel that might be willing to help. First hotel was NO as I was not sraying with them. This hotel understood the Jam I was in and did help me even though I was not a guest!  I am so very grateful, I can't say enough good about the personnel here. Place was beautiful as well.
Thanks so very much. Allowed me to attend black taxi tour on the troubles the next morning",5,2015,11,16
226,Return visit,"Nice stay. Our room wasn't ready which was no big deal but first we received coffee/ Coke then the manager brought us Guinness. Our room is very nice ( smells so good)!

Two wishes: I wish it was brighter in the hallway and that there is a plug in the bathroom for the hair dryer ( you don't wake up your sleeping partner)!!

",4,2015,11,15
226,Afternoon Tea,"We visited this hotel today 14th Nov for a wee treat for one of my friend's Birthday.
The Afternoon Tea was delicious but
there are two negative things which I would like to mention them.
1-No choice of scones, all came the same, fruity. Some customers would prefer just plain.

2-We ask for leftovers to take home and they're wrapped in cling film with no carrier bag or anything, didn't look great for such a nice hotel.

I would also like to mention one of the waitress, Anna. She was so polite and pleasant. 
Lots of credit for staff like her. 
",4,2015,11,14
226,"Good, with some problems","Check in was slow as receptionist unsure how voucher system worked; needed to talk to supervisor. Seemed poorly trained, though pleasant.
Room lighting too low and could not see the air con control as it was in an unlit alcove.
Otherwise excellent room, large and comfortable. I had underbooked the grade as the web indicated an upgrade was available and I did not ask as there was enough difficulty getting checked in.
Bar quiet on this Sunday evening but enough people there to allow for some atmosphere. Restaurant was full in the section opened and we received great service. Starter was a prawn macaroni; dry when should be creamy with two very very small prawns - hardly Bangor's best. Main courses of haddock and salmon excellent.
Breakfast was one of the best in town but toast arrived as we finished after two reminders.
The awful thing about this DBB was that it was all we could ask for but always blighted by minor issues. Would we go back ? Absolutely.",4,2015,11,10
226,Unbelievable Service,"We had never been to Belfast before and chose it on a whim for a mini break. The Fitzwilliam was recommended to us by a friend from NI and it looked beautiful so we booked. Our flight was due in at 8am so I emailed in advance to ask if we could drop our bags off early, and a reply back told me this wasn't a problem. When we did arrive (in torrential weather) to drop our bags the receptionist advised that our room was ready and we could check in a staggering 6 hours early at no extra cost. This, to me, is EXCEPTIONAL service. The room itself was incredible, the hotel decor is classy, welcoming and well presented. The concierge lent us umbrellas for both days and when we called to check if we had left a phone charger in the room, they mailed it to us free of charge. 
My only suggestion for improvement would be a spa, for cosy nights in when the Belfast weather hits. 5 stars.",5,2015,11,10
226,Excellent Hotel in A Great Location,"We stayed here for two nights and the stay was excellent from start to finish.  The room was exceptional, the bed was really comfy!!  The check in staff were excellent and the doormen/concierge particularly helpful.  We ate in the restaurant on the first night, the food was excellent and service very good.  As the restaurant was already fully booked on the second night, concierge booked us into a restaurant in the city and that was equally as good and we had no hassle of trying to find somewhere ourselves.  I would definitely recommend this hotel and I will definitely be staying here again on my next visit!!",5,2015,11,10
226,Excellent boutique hotel. Easy acces from the Dublin airport bus.,"Excellent rooms, excellent in-room coffee, excellent bed, wonderful showers, perfect eggs Benedict over breakfast, cool lobby. A little impersonal though, but hey, great nevertheless.

The hotel is just one minute walk from the bus station where the buses from Dublin airport arrive. Really, really convenient if that's where you arrive. 

Lots of great restaurants within a three block radius.",5,2015,11,09
226,Lovely Stay,"Stayed here for 2 nights to go to theatre next door. My daughter recommended it to us and she was right! Greeted by very nice staff, check in was very quick and pleasant. Our room was lovely with a huge comfy bed. The bathroom was fantastic with large bath and large shower. In my other reviews of hotels I almost always complain about the lack of hooks to hang clothes and other things in a room, no complaints this time! Only complaint was no power point at my side of the bed to charge my phone. 
We ate in the restaurant on first evening from the pre-theatre menu and it was well presented and very tasty although the service was a bit slow especially as we were actually going to the theatre, but we got there on time. Breakfast on both mornings was good but not in keeping with the standard of the evening meal. 
Overall we would recommend this lovely hotel and especially its a great place to stay if you are going to the Grand Opera House which is right next door. Thanks to all the staff.",5,2015,11,09
226,One of Northern Irelands Best,"My wife and I stayed here for a night in October for her birthday, I've stayed in most of the nicer hotels in Northern Ireland and I would rate this as one of the best.

I emailed ahead and they left a lovely card and chocolates for our arrival, the rooms are simply stunning, we had a corner suite with class views through the city.  I am not going to go into each detail, the photos available of the hotel speak a million words.  It is immaculate, staff couldn't do enough for us and the food in the restaurant is gorgeous.  

We had a few drinks in the bar and the atmosphere was nice, it was a saturday night and was busy without being packed, perfect for a night cap.

I will be back again.

anyone staying from outside belfast, its a couple of hundred yards from great victoria train station, 5 mins walk into the city centre shopping areas and 15-20mins walk to the cathedral quarter.",5,2015,11,09
226,This is how it should be done!,"Can‚Äôt fault it! Brilliant location a stone‚Äôs throw from the centre, great sized rooms, amazing bathrooms and toiletries. Enormous comfortable bed with crisp white sheets! Lovely bar and reception with the ubiquitous charming Irish staff!  Can‚Äôt wait to go back!",5,2015,11,09
226,Dinner ,"Went out for dinner last week with the hubby lovely main course the staff where very nice and service was quick will be back again soon
Would tell my friends try here for a lovely experience only thing it was hard for me to choose a starter I am a picky eater ",4,2015,11,06
226,A champagne afternoon with no fizz,"Oh dear, what a disappointment. When a friend offered me the champagne afternoon tea at the Fitzwilliam hotel as a treat I was really looking forward to the experience. The last time I'd had proper afternoon tea was back in the 1960's in the Grand Central hotel when my mother treated my brother and myself. I have vivid memories of the light filled room, the tables dressed in imaculate linen and the attentiveness of serving staff pouring our tea into the perfect China. I didn't aspect the same sort of experience in the Fitzwillam but a more urbane, modern twist and a certain degree of sophistication as befits the rest of the hotel. Well things didn't start well and got progressively worse. On arrival we were told that we were being served in the bar. Now I'm sure the bar area is ok at night for a drink but it is very dark and, on a grey Belfast day, positively gloomy. So there we were in the company of a few afternoon drinkers. The waiter arrived and asked us if we wanted tea or coffee. A few minutes later a couple of mugs were set on the bare table and a few minutes after that a pot of tea and coffee arrived. Maybe I was expecting too much but it would have been nice to have the beverages served rather that help yourself. We sat for about 20 minutes waiting for the champagne and food until, getting slightly impatient, asked the waitress where it was. We were told that you don't get champagne unless you ask for it, which seemed odd since we'd booked in for the champagne option. After a few minutes the 'champagne' arrived. The few remaining bubbles in the tiny glasses disappeared in seconds and our drinks looked as dull and lifeless as a grey Belfast day. After about another 20 minutes the food arrived on a tea stand that looked like it had been purchased at a B&M bargain bucket sale. Bottom layer finger sandwiches, middle layer two scones, mince pies, macaroons ,chocolate and a ganache on the top and, on the side was a small sample of soup. I'll start with the sandwiches. There were plenty of them but quite a few were missing any filling. The ones that were filled contained egg and onion, or should I say onion with a smattering of egg. The taste was so strong that I've still got dragons breath  three hours later. The others had tasteless cooked ham or chicken wth a bit of salad. I didn't bother trying the scones but ate one of the chocolates which was ok and the ganache. The only good thing I can say about the experience is that the staff were all very smart and friendly but that didn't temp us to stay any longer than we had to. I don't think I'll be back!",2,2015,11,06
226,"First time visit, can't wait for second.","I've never left a review before, but felt this hotel was so good that it deserved feedback. From the moment you arrive your treated like a VIP. Valet parking (pre booked), enthusiastic and friendly staff, luxurious surroundings and an amazing room, I honestly don't have a single complaint. Friends of ours who were staying at the Hilton met us at our hotel for a drink before we left for a meal and took a look at our room, they both agreed ours at the Fitzwilliam was a better room!
  If you decide to treat yourself to a break here, you MUST book and use the valet parking for that true VIP feeling, and also experience their amazing cocktails, long Island ice tea and Singapore slings particular favourites. 

Thank you to all the staff for an amazing relaxing break.",5,2015,11,05
226,Birthday afternoon tea,Took my mother-inlaw for birthday afternoon tea was served by a lovely girl lorraine and another member of staff Brian.Good selection for afternoon tea staff were excellent could not have been nicer which made the experience even better would highly reccommend to anyone and price was very resonnable food very good but staff even better hotel should be very proud of staff had a lovely day,5,2015,11,03
226,Great hotel in Belfast,"This was our first trip to Belfast, so we needed to find a hotel that was comfortable, modern and central. The Fitzwilliam is the perfect hotel and our stay was simply perfect. the hotel staff were always friendly and attentive and ready to advise us where to visit. Highly recommended.",5,2015,11,01
226,Fab hotel ,"We spent two nights at The Fitzwilliam Belfast in October. What a lovely hotel. The staff were excellent. 

The foyer area is so relaxing & comforting. I loved the fire & flower displays. 

Breakfast was great, fresh fruit & breakfast was cooked per order rather than food sitting there for all to help themselves 

I'll definitely go back soon!",5,2015,10,30
226,Excellent Hotel,The Fitzwilliam as you would expect is a fantastic hotel and does not disappoint. The staff are all very helpful and the rooms nicely appointed. It is just across the road from the historic Crown Bar.,5,2015,10,30
226,Fantastic,"Our first stay with the Fitzwilliam for a short 1 night trip to Belfast.
Our room was upgraded to a superior room which was a great start! 
The hotel in general is modern, classy and really a very nice place to be.
We did not eat dinner in the hotel but given the quality of the breakfast we experienced we wished that we had!
All in a great hotel in a great city centre location!
 ",5,2015,10,29
226,Still great,"Second time at the FW, same good hotel. the rooms are generous, with a desk and separate bathroom that has a bath and shower.

you are made to feel welcome when you arrive. The staff are knowledgeable about the area and happy to part with advice for restaurants, rental cars etc.",5,2015,10,28
226,Lovely hotel room but bit noisy,"My partner and I stayed here on Saturday night. The hotel room itself was lovely!! Could not fault the facilities. Through the night I was woke up by people out in the corridor. I fell back to sleep again but got woke again by the sound of next doors shower. The bed was amazing! Massive comfy bed that if it was a bit quieter I could have slept all night (and day lol). The breakfast was lovely in the morning but I noticed after we ordered the cooked breakfast, other people beside us were offered toast along with it, and how they wanted their eggs cooked and if they wanted any sauces. We were not asked any of this. (Didn't know it was an option until we heard 2 other couples being asked) we were happy enough with what we got though. Overall a lovely hotel but it's just the little details we wish could have been better.",3,2015,10,26
226,Great hotel,"Very good location centrally, just a few minutes walk from a lot of the best rated restaurants in the city. The room and bed were very big and the bathroom was lovely. Breakfast was a bit pricy and the continental selection wasn't the best but the porridge was great and the hot food was lovely. Would definitely stay again if was in the city. ",5,2015,10,26
226,Great stay great place ! Luxury ! ,"Great hotel really friendly staff , rooms are next to nothing but perfect ! , great facilities bathroom is luxurious ! Will stay again loved it ! Will be booking for xmas market 2015 , only negative but not important is that I had a pint of peroni at the bar and think it came to roughly ¬£5 for a pint which on the north coast where I am from is mad pricing for a pint , but aside from drinking in the hotel everything else is more than perfect ! ",5,2015,10,26
226,Nice Hotel good location,"Just returned from a two night stay at this nice Hotel, we stayed over the weekend Friday and Satuarday 
On arrival good check in and very prompt our room was on the 5th Floor to the Front,a king executive room,
Only small complaint was the Church bells chiming on the Hour in the Church across the Road
Room was good size and kept well serviced by the Chamber Maid
Food was good and the two young ladies in the bar area looked after us very well,along with the Bar Staff
Check our was easy and very quick
We left our baggage in the store room as our flight home was not until early evening
This allowed us to take some extra time to discover Belfast
By mistake we had left some items in our room, however when we returned to the hotel
And asked at reception Room a Services had it ready for us in a envelope so 10 out of 10
We would decently recommend this Hotel and would Return ",5,2015,10,25
226,Wonderful Hotel,"I stayed recently for 4 nights here.  It is a lovely hotel, very modern but also comfortable.  Rooms are spacious and bathroom was very large and shower was great, large walk-in shower with good water pressure.
Breakfast was good and served quickly.
Check in and check out were both very efficient.
Beds are comfortable although a bit on the firm side, i like them a bit less hard.
Very close to city centre and a great overall stay.
Windows do open if you want some fresh air.  Could hear a bit late at night when the bars closed but not too much.  Can also hear the church bells in the daytime but not at night.",5,2015,10,25
226,excellent hotel,"My husband & stayed in fitzwilliam friday nite 22nd october for his birthday & would have to say it was absolutely fabulous, from the moment we arrived until we departed we were made to feel extra special.  The hotel itself is by the best in belfast & we've stayed in quite a few, every member of staff is super friendly & helpful, they really couldn't do enough to make your stay the best.  The hotel itself is absolutely gorgeous & decorated to a very high standard, we will be back.  I would give it a 15 out of 10.",5,2015,10,25
226,Excellent all round! ,"A great experience from the superb suite, friendly staff, valet parking and great service! 
We were made welcome from the second we parked outside the door until our car was returned to us after a great break. 
We'll be back! ",5,2015,10,25
226,Ideal position and superb Concierge service,"We arrived in the rush hour, but the Concierge service immediately took charge of our luggage and parked our car - bliss!  The hotel is ideally placed in central Belfast, within easy walking distance of the Opera House;  the Ulster Hall;  several excellent restaurants and bars.  There is also a courtesy bus which takes you to the ""hop on hop off"" tour.  
The hotel is very modern and there were points at which I felt that convenience had been sacrificed to style (especially in our room).  The food was fine and the service in general very good indeed.
If you can possible afford it, I would pay for a studio suite, which glimpsed through a doorway looked lovely.  Our room (802) is to be avoided if possible.  It was very smart and the bed very comfortable.  But it was extremely cramped, there was no storage in the bathroom, the coffee facilities were in a dark corner with nowhere to plug in the kettle and the window could only be accessed by pulling out a huge couch and two tables.
Nevertheless, the concierge service and the position made up for this and I would certainly go back, albeit to a different room.",5,2015,10,23
226,Very nice,"My company booked me in here for 1 night and was very impressed. Everything seemed new and had a luxurious feel.. Friendly staff, good barman who spent time and effort making drinks. Irish breakfast was average but the continental speed looked pretty good (didn't have time to try it). Would definitely stay again.",5,2015,10,20
226,Fabulous,"Great hotel, great service and great staff. Really good location and the staff couldn't do enough for you. Would definitely stay again. 
The suite was very well equipt with lots of thoughtful details and the view over Belfast was fantastic.  Valet parking was ¬£17 which was really good value and the car was back in minutes when we requested it.",5,2015,10,20
226,Best of Belfast Encapsulated at Fitzwilliam,"Located close to everything in central Belfast, my wife and I just wanted a chill out weekend. From arrival to departure, we had a wonderful experience of Belfast especially with our Hotel. From front desk to return of our car, we could not have asked for more. Nothing was a problem. Our room was beautifully appointed, contemporary, nothing missing, matches and tea light in the bathroom a nice touch. We missed breakfast on Sunday and were immediately recommended to go to 'Harlem' where we enjoyed a great brunch in a great atmosphere. Thank you The Fitzwilliam",5,2015,10,20
226,Stay,Excellent rooms and had a very good stay. Great central location in Belfast and short walking distance into Belfast City Centre. Close to bars restaurant etc. Would defo stay again. Lazy Sunday deal which us a great option,4,2015,10,19
226,Clean and modern,"A great friendly welcome upon arrival. Everywhere you looked there was great fresh flower displays which always impresses me.

Our room was a good size, well thought out space and we loved the contemporary modern design. The room was spotless. 

My only niggle was that I would've like the toiletries to have been of a larger size because we'd forgot to bring our shower gel !!! (I'm sure I could've just rang down for more though) 

We would more than happy stay here again, for its price, location and the staff",5,2015,10,19
226,Weekend reunion,"Wonderful hotel right in the heart of Belfast. Staff friendly and helpful. 
Accommodation exceeded our expectations. 
The food in the restaurant was delicious. 
We enjoyed every minute of our stay in the Fitzwilliam.",5,2015,10,18
226,Modern hotel with a great location,"Stayed for 2 nights (Friday and Saturday night). The receptionist was very friendly on arrival. The room was decorated with modern interior. The king size bed was very comfortable. The bathroom has a separate bath and shower and bathrobes are provided. The location is very central but the noise from traffic is well concealed, you can here the bells from city hall in the morning. We availed of late check out which is ¬£10 per hour. Probably one of the more pricey hotels in Belfast, it's was approx ‚Ç¨350 for two nights and this didn't include breakfast. If you're not on a tight budget then it's a lovely treat. We parked in mc causland car park across the road but I don't know if it was significantly cheaper than the hotel parking. ",4,2015,10,18
226,Great location,"Was given an invalid friendly room on 8 th floor!! have to kneel down to use the wash had basin!! Room set up quite well and comfortable. To the back so no traffic noise.
Gym is modest if more than two folk use it one runs out of options! printer in Business centre still kaput....been that way for a long time? Staff very friendly. Decent value.",4,2015,10,16
226,Second time round even better!,"Stayed recently in the Fitzwilliam for the second time and had forgotten just how really great this hotel is.  From the moment you step inside, the Concierge and Reception staff go all out to make you feel as welcome as possible.  The rooms are spacious, vey well appointed and spotlessly clean.  Breakfast is served in the spacious dining area on the first floor and is of excellent quality - cooked to order -  not a single sight of stewed scrambled eggs, mushy beans or greasy bacon anywhere .... what a delight!!!!  The location of the hotel is perfect for sightseeing as all of the tour buses, including the Giants Causeway tours, stop close by.  We had a great stay and will definitely be back.

Useful tip:
If you are visiting over the weekend, be aware that Belfast shops do not open on Sunday's until 1pm.",5,2015,10,16
226,Birthday Bash was Brilliant ,"This hotel is flash and fabulous! Our visit was to celebrate a double birthday and we weren't disappointed! 
Car parking was a little difficult and traffic was hectic but that's part of being in the city centre - great location for the opera house, shops & restaurants galore. 
The foyer is lovely and the fire so welcoming but our room was the highlight. We had a luxury suite which was wonderful with robes, French press coffee, magazines & a view! The shower was amazing as was the bath tub. The room was a great temperature & the sofa made our room more spacious & therefore our stay more relaxing! 
Our TV was tricky to work & we couldn't open any windows to admire the view more but it was still stunning. We didn't have breakfast as it's not included and about ¬£17pp so we ate out. 
Great hotel & wonderful stay, lovely to not have to check out til 11am so we will be back! ",4,2015,10,13
226,Great Hotel,"Nice location, very friendly reception and staff. Very well appointed rooms and bathrooms, really comfortable beds with nice pillows and linen, seperate bath and walk in shower which is always nice.
Wide selection at breakfast, would stay here again and recommend.",5,2015,10,12
226,A fantastic hotel,"My wife and I stayed in August but I have only just got around to the review,  we both felt this is one of the best we have stayed in and was in a brilliant location in the city centre, we were with 8 friends and they all enjoyed it as much as we did.
The rooms were very large with all amenities, lovely bathrooms and both spotlessly clean which is not always the case for a busy hotel in a city centre, the staff were lovely and very attentive with nothing being too much trouble.
We dined in the hotel one night, the food was delicious with a very good menu, the staff were great and really looked after us despite having quite a few customers that night, the dining room is very well designed to give space without making it appear too large.
Breakfast was delicious with local ingredients and could not be faulted, they even have umbrellas in the wardrobes for guests to use during their stay which is a nice touch, we will definitely stay at the Fitzwilliam the next time we are in Belfast",5,2015,10,11
226,Very Luxurious Hotel,"The hotel was very luxurious with dark d√©cor. Dining room was very beautiful. Our room was slightly small, but the bathroom was large with a separate shower and bathtub. The staff was very pleasant and helpful. The concierge Philip helped us a lot on directions and advice.",4,2015,10,10
226,Outstanding,"Spent the evening with my partner as a surprise. The service is outstanding the staff totally go the extra mile and make you feel special whilst also being down to earth and warm. The room was beautiful with a fantastic view, comfy bed and stylish surroundings. ",5,2015,10,10
226,2 night stay was perfection!,"Beautiful rooms, bathrooms, restaurant, foyer and an absolutely perfect location to the city centre.

The restaurant was the icing on the cake for me, though. The young waitress that looked after us was professional, efficient and such a lovely young lady. Thanks Rachel!

We will be back every time we're in Belfast as we haven't stopped talking about our stay since.",5,2015,10,09
226,Beautiful hotel & Great Breakfast,"Beautifully renovated rooms with great bedding & duvets.
I have Celiac disease, so I needed Gluten Free food. Lunch was a bit of a challenge, but they managed a plain salad with a large portion of delicious salmon. Breakfast was beyond amazing. I had GF eggs Benedict. Hollandaise sauce & ham was out of this world. Poached eggs cooked to perfection. 
Only negative was the lack of availability of concierge. Front desk staff made up for it though, as they were friendly & helpful. 
Complementary bottled water (in glass bottles) & slippers were a nice touch.
Will definitely return next time we're in Belfast. ",5,2015,10,06
226,The bathroom is exquisite.,"My dream home will have a bathroom just like the one at this hotel!! 
Not sure guests realise though that when you're walking down on the street, you can see clearly into the bedrooms (even with the blinds down).",5,2015,10,06
226,Best Hotel Experience,"One of the best Hotels I have had the pleasure of staying in. Highly recommend this hotel on every level. The staff were fantastic from the moment we arrived, reception were genuinely friendly for check in and check out, as was the night porter when we got back that night, the guy who delivered our room service was super friendly too. There wasn't one person that didn't give a first class service.

Our dinner and breakfast were of an exceptionally high standard. The steaks were perfection. I enjoyed my meal so much. The breakfast was phenomenal! Our Bedroom was beautiful, large, bright, quiet and just comfortable all round. There was free Wifi and it worked brilliantly!

Even as I write this review I'm trying to think when we can go back. I realise this is a bit of a gushing review, but i genuinely cannot fault this Hotel. It was really really nice to go somewhere and get such great service, great food and feel you got good value for money. I wish everywhere was this enjoyable. 

Thank you to everyone for a brilliant stay.",5,2015,10,06
226,Perfect for spoiling yourself,"Went here for a birthday two-night stay. Very clean and luxurious hotel. Felt absolutely pampered! Bathroom had a shower and seperate bath facilities. Everything was clean and modern. A little living room space in the bedrom too.

Hotel staff were very polite, helpful and friendly. We went to the front desk staff and the concierge's with all our queries and always came away with helpful information.

Would definitely recommend as it is also within walking distance of the night-life areas of Belfast.",5,2015,10,04
226,Wonderful hotel.,"stayed at this hotel for 3 nights and I cannot fault this.  
All the staff are very attentive and nice, catering for everything.  the Concierges helped book our tour bus, and even told us of the nice restaurants nearby.  the hotel rooms are spacious and comfortable and pristine as is the whole hotel. We didn't use the restaurant so cannot comment on this but the bar area is very comfortable. it was our wedding anniversary and when we arrived in our room there was a plate of chocs and strawberries with happy anniversary written in chocolate, a nice gesture I thought.  the hotel is is a good location with everything walking distance.  Overall a great hotel and I will be going there again the next time I visit Belfast",5,2015,10,04
226,Tip class hotel.,From start to finish this hotel is one of the best. That finer detail they put in to make your stay more comfortable. The staff are all so friendly and helpful. The room was just perfect and bed very comfortable. Bathroom was just devine. I love the colour scheme in the room. Trendy and chic. The breakfast in the morning was superb. It is an expensive place to stay but hey you pay for what you get in this world. Will definitely return. ,5,2015,10,04
226,Look no further,"Stayed here for 3 nights for a little city break,the staff make a Hotel and the staff here are a real credit, everybody seemed to know my name and always asked me if i needed or wanted anything they really couldn't have done more.The restaurant was excellent.Had one problem with my evening meal and the response was excellent.Thank you.I will be back!",5,2015,10,01
226,Business overnighter,"Stayed here a few times and every time it's been a pleasure so good marks for consistency.
Clean, staff very helpful at reception and in bar/restaurant.
Room wise go for the higher floor the better as low rooms, roadside do get a bit of road noise late on and early morning. Or go for a room at the rear.
Fitness suite is a bit small, needs some heavier weights as 10kg isn't enough.
I'd certainly recommend this hotel.",5,2015,09,29
226,spoiled,"Had eaten here before excellent took my wife for her birthday weekend, as 2 nurses we know how difficult it it is to serve the public. Well we could not reccommend this hotel high enough, even though we live 10 miles away.food fantastic service fantastic , room to die for . Megan bar & Megan restaurant , Anna restaurant are a credit to the hotel !

226,Great food wonderful service! ,"My friend and I went for a meal at the Fitzwilliam before going out to have a few drinks in town.  I had never been to the Fitzwilliam before and to my surprise it was a great atmosphere, the staff were excellent and the service was very good.  We had cocktails with our meal. The food was well prepared and presented,  absolutely delicious! It's got the look of a very posh place but once inside you're  made to feel welcome and the whole experience of dinner and drinks was a lovely one. I  would recommend that you give it a go the next time you find yourself in Belfast. ",4,2015,09,29
226,weekend in belfast,"we stayed at this hotel for a weekend in belfast as we had a birthday party to attend , well the hotel was over all good , clean and tidy, one thing is you could get a draft beer at the bar, staff was very helpful , the bed was very comfy and i slept like a log , our room was very modern and well presented , the bathroom should have had a vanity unit as you could not put our wash bags anywhere and the tea making was in the cupboard and had to bring it out to the table to make a cuppa , all in all good hotel , did not like the security guards asking  us  for our room number  and surname when we came back to the hotel , all in all the stay was good and give it 8 out of 10",4,2015,09,28
226,Friendly and helpful with extras that make it a quality hotel,The hotel was clean with added attention to detail for example candle in bathroom so you can relax and unwind...the staff extremely friendly and helpful.  Breakfast was scrumptious. Quality food staff and hotel rooms. Would recommend anyone to stay here as central and convenient to visit sights.,5,2015,09,28
226,Attentive staff mean the difference between good and very good!,"Unfortunately hotel availability in Belfast over a weekend is not good. This was certainly the case with the Fitzwilliam where prices are hicked up considerably. The feel good factor came into our lives with the attitude of the staff. In particular a very handsome and well dressed 6ft something of a consiege named Stephen, typical of all the staff we came in contact with he made our stay just that bit better. Breakfast, the only meal we had on our 2 night stay was most enjoyable",4,2015,09,28
226,Fabulous staff make this a great place to stay,"The Fitzwilliam is very close to shopping center,and the buzzing Cathedral Quarter.My room on the 3rd floor was large and comfortable.The bed was super gorgeous and I slept like a log,unheard of for me in a hotel.For me the staff make this hotel,every single member of staff went out of their way to make me feel welcome and comfortable.I was on business and its not much fun being on your own in a hotel but they did everything they could to make me feel welcome.I have to say a big thank you to the concierge team who are brilliant and the girls on reception who are very friendly and beyond helpful.Your manager should be very proud of his team",5,2015,09,27
226,"Comfortable, good service","Rooms are well appointed, comfortable.  Decor is a matter of taste: some might find the hallways oddly dark and gloomy (especially so in winter, when it's already gloomy out).  Walk-in shower a convenience for those who don't like to clamber over high bath walls.  One matter of concern.  We were in a room with a door to the room next.  Person in the other room was talking on the phone (I presume); we could hear him more easily than each other.  A word to the front desk resolved the matter.  But curiously intrusive for a hotel of this caliber.  Still, overall, a solid place.",5,2015,09,27
226,Outstanding!,"My husband and I stayed in the Fitzwilliam for a weekend in August to celebrate our 15th wedding anniversary and from start to finish it was a fabulous experience, our room was spacious and comfortable, the food and service both at breakfast and at our evening meal was outstanding, the staff were friendly and welcoming. Special thanks to the general manager, Cian who left a lovely note and special treat in our room as an anniversary surprise. We cannot wait to return!",5,2015,09,26
226,Beautiful ,My husband took me here as a suprised before going to the opera house and I must say the service was second to none. The starter pork and scallops was amazing as was the steak couldn't eat desert we were to full. The staff are a credit to the establishment. The chef is amazing. We will definitely be going back as soon as possible. Thank you for a lovely dinner. Was possibly the best we have had and we go out to eat quite a lot and am ashamed to say we are very picky. Can't say enough about the Fitzwilliam amazing üòä,5,2015,09,26
226,Fantastic staff & breakfast,The hotel is very well located and the reception area is lovely.  The halls are very very dark which husband hated. I didn't mind until I literally had to lean right into the door to se whether the sign I had displayed read clean the room or do not disturb!  The lifts are the polar opposites which is strange.  The staff are excellent and an issue that had not been noted on arrival was dealt with very professionally by Suzanne in Reservations.  The breakfast is the best we have ever had and the staff are so attentive.  I would definitely return.,4,2015,09,24
226,Luxurry Hotel,Very good hotel in a really good location. walking distance to all the Belfast attractions. Great rooms with luxury facilities. The entertainment staff were really helpful. The only down side was that we could not drink our soft drinks in the lobby area.,4,2015,09,23
226,Outstanding Hotel,"Loved this place. Stayed here the weekend of the 14th of August on the Saturday night. Friendly check in and check out. Reception were very friendly on arrival and departure. Really great atmosphere, could not have been any nicer. The night porter was similarly genuinely nice on arrival back that night. Front office team were brilliant in responding to small requests such as extra towels to room etc.
Every single member of staff encountered was exceptionally friendly and professional.

 We had dinner and breakfast included in the rate, availed of both and found the standard of food and service to be excellent. Dinner was delicious and our steaks were cooked to perfection. The breakfast was delivered to the room, it was again delicious!

Bedroom was very comfortable, large and exceptionally nicely decorated, in particular the bathroom. Very comfortable bed, black out blinds and a very quiet room. Wifi was free and fast.

The bar downstairs was a little sterile and didn't fit the well with the rest of the hotel because everything else was of such a high standard, that said, it was a bar that would be nice anywhere else, They just set a high standard overall. The staff were again very attentive and friendly and there was table service which was a plus.

100% will definitely be back to stay here. One of the best hotel experiences I have had.",5,2015,09,16
226,The Fitzwilliam Hotel - Did I Stay There?,"This was my first stay at the Fitzwilliam, and I was looking forward to it as I had heard good things from my local colleagues.  Perhaps my tastes are different but I found the hotel dark, dated and depressing.  I'm told this is a relatively new hotel which makes this all the more difficult to understand.  The lifts seem old and clunky and the corridor on the floor on which I was staying was almost in total darkness.  The doors to the rooms have full length mirrors on the outside which is most disconcerting.  There was also a smell of acetate in the corridor (4th floor).  Interestingly when I mentioned this to a colleague who had stayed previously she had noticed the same smell?  So, on to the room which is a good size with a similarly good sized bathroom - but guess what - really dark.  D√©cor was green and brown with almost subdued lighting.  TV remote so worn that you can no longer read the function of any of the buttons and a small music player tucked away that still has a cassette player in it.  Perhaps this is all meant to be retro and I've missed the plot?  The bathroom is black and chrome - nice fittings (Grohe), good size shower and nice shower gels/shampoos.  The room was initially very warm but the air-con did the trick when turned right down - but then after I switched it off it kept going.  Luckily for me I like a cool (temp) room!!  No problems with it being kept clean except the last visitors key-card holder was left on the desk and when I left an empty bottle of beer on the desk Wednesday night, after room service, it was still there Friday am when I left to check out!
The lobby is spartan, not welcoming but plenty of seating.  The reception staff were very friendly both at check in and check out - and I would say that all the staff (bar and restaurant) were friendly and also offered excellent service.  The bar area is similarly sparsely furnished with cramped 4 seat booths into which you have to slide in and out but the food was fine and delivered promptly and the same regarding service and food can be said of the restaurant.  The overwhelming impression of this hotel for me was the lack of light.......but more than that, the complete lack of atmosphere.  The hotel is centrally located with plenty of entertainment opportunities around but very busy surrounding roads in the morning can delay your journey.  As a business traveller I have stayed in a couple of the other well known Belfast hotels and I would have this one in 3rd place.",3,2015,09,15
226,First Class,My Husband and I use this hotel regularly when we stay in Belfast. The friendly staff are always happy to help. The hotels central location is great so you can reach the City within minutes by foot. This hotel is just perfect for an overnight stay and the rooms are well equipped for every needs. Free wifi is available within your hotel room. Car parking facilities too but at a charge.,5,2015,09,10
226,First Class Hotel,Stayed here for my 1st wedding anniversary. We stayed in a studio suite it was beautiful very spacious and worth every penny. Breakfast was beautiful and staff were very helpful and polite. Love this hotel no faults at all. This was my 2nd visit. Will be back again.,5,2015,09,09
226,"Beautiful, modern hotel","I recently stayed here whilst on a night out forms 30thbirthday.  The staff on check in were very friendly and polite.  The hallways are beautiful with mirrored doors and dim lighting.  The rooms are gorgeous, very modern decoration with a luxurious feel.  Plenty of room and everything you could need.  Staff had left me a plate with happy birthday piped on it and some petit four which was a lovely touch.  The bathroom was generous with both a bath and a large separate shower.  Would definitely stay here again.",5,2015,09,08
226,Very good hotel,Stayed 2 nights at the Fitzwilliam in early September. Room was very nice..comfortable beds..was some confusion re our stay but was sorted out very quickly. concierge was excellent. Restaurant was also excellent. breakfast was very good and generous. We had dinner our last night and were very surprised with the quality of the food..steak  and salmon were both excellent.. Sticky toffee pudding was one of the best ever!,4,2015,09,07
226,Anniversary treat ,"Stayed 1 night here at the Fitwilliam hotel with my fianc√©e and it exceeded all expectations! We stayed in the deluxe suite on the 6th floor and the room was outstanding and the bathroom was just amazing! View of the city hall looked fabulous at night as well and the staff were all so helpful and friendly, will definitely be back here again and would recommend anyone looking for a hotel to book here! ",5,2015,09,05
226,"Excellent Lunch, thanks Brian","As a novice to this fine establishment was looking a quick bite of lunch, my opinion was as such; the bar at the back is a tad dark, the only downside. The menu was fantastic, extremely well priced for the hotels reputation and location. Brian our waiter went above and beyond for each of us, even the children complimented his friendly and helpful demeanour. I will endeavour to highly recommend this establishment to my friends and family and if they hit it lucky, Brian might even be on duty too. ",5,2015,09,05
226,Phenomenal boutique hotel in a great location!,"We got a great deal on the Fitzwilliam, and were so pleased that we decided to opt for a slightly nicer hotel - particularly after many days spent at B&Bs as we traveled through the North and South. The Fitzwilliam is impeccable - gorgeous, modern rooms that were very large and comfortable (as compared to other boutique hotels, which tend to go for tiny rooms and make up for it with modern finishings). The bathroom was to die for, and I was only sad we didn't stay longer because I would have loved the excuse to take several more showers and long baths in that amazing bathroom! The staff, particularly the concierge, were incredibly friendly and helpful, and the breakfast was very, very nice.  It's an easy walk to some really great areas of town, and a reasonable cab ride to the Titanic exhibit and other sites. We loved staying here, and will definitely stay again if we are ever back in (beautiful) Belfast! 

(Final note: I did hear another couple commenting on how DARK the hallways are - which was true, but I kind of liked it... gave it a very intimate and upscale feel.)",5,2015,09,04
226,Anniversary treat,Stayed over for wedding anniversary treat. Staff were excellent hotel very nice. Booked special deal which included evening meal which was lovely portion sizes very small. Waiter service excellent. Breakfast was fabulous very enjoyable. ,5,2015,09,03
226,Afternoon tea a delight,"Have only been here for afternoon tea, but it was excellent, greeted with a glass of bubbly by a beautiful helpful waitress, the service was outstanding & she even brought us more sandwiches etc,,,we spent 2& 1/2 hours sipping r tea in the beautiful very modern surroundings, will definitely be back for dinner soon,",4,2015,09,02
226,Take your Biz to the Fitz,"This place is consistent.  When you find somewhere like this is does not let you down.  Friendly competent receptionists, clean and stylish rooms, great bar snacks, cocktails and tea area with fire.  Relaxed, perfectly located.  Welcoming service at breakfast with quality local food.
Came here twice with business early summer and brought my wife with me for visit 3 in August.  
Come here for business for sure - but come back for pleasure - less than 1 minute walk from the theatre, live music and some great Belfast craic..........",5,2015,09,01
226,Another Fabulous Stay At Fitzwilliam,"This was my second stay at The Fitzwilliam and it was every bit as good as the first.  
I was welcomed back by the receptionist who acknowledged my previous visit, a small thing but a nice touch.  I had requested a room on the same floor as before as the views across town to the cave hill are lovely. I was only one room along on the same floor and the view was perfect.  All the little touches make this a great hotel but what makes it stand out is the exceptional welcome from all the team.  Very down to earth and friendly but professional at the same time.  They get the balance just right
My only gripe this time was the eco hairdryers‚Ä¶ its quiet an art to keep the little button firmly pressed in while trying to style your hair.  I failed to keep the little sucker going long enough and ended up putting my hair up in a pony tail‚Ä¶not the look i was going for for my meeting later that day.  So please Fitzwilliam, find an alternative that is kind to the environment but that is styling friendly too.",5,2015,08,31
226,Lap of Luxury,"The staff at this hotel are the best we have ever come to interact with.  Receptionists were always kind and welcoming, offering tea and coffee every time we sat in the lobby.  The concierges were excellent as well.  They were all well versed with things to do in the city (and personal opinions on what not to do) while always remaining very professional. We were on a first named basis with a concierge their named Phil (even tho we had a short stay) and he saved us ¬£70 on a tour we were scheduled for that would repeated many stops we did the day before, much appreciated!  Though the hotel offers parking at a flat rate of ¬£17 per day/night, it is cheaper than any other alternative to parking in the city, just make sure you pre-book if needed. Our room was big and very nice with a large bathroom equipped with both shower and tub (individually).  Centrally located in Belfast we found walking around to be an welcome alternative to driving. Additionally if it's raining (which it does quite often) the hotel is quick to provide large umbrellas in every room and down at the concierge desk if you forget yours or need to run out real quick.  This is the only hotel I will stay in if I go back to Belfast, not only because of the accommodations but also the staff.",5,2015,08,28
226,Another excellent stay at the Fitz!,Treated my wife to a stay at the Fitzwilliam for our anniversary. The one thing that always stands out at the Fitzwilliam for me is how the staff are beyond friendly and always willing to do whatever is necessary to make your stay that little bit more enjoyable. Thanks for a great anniversary weekend!,5,2015,08,28
226,Great location for sightseeing.,"I visited this hotel as part of a hen party. 

The hotel is extremely well decorated. The staff are very accommodating and pleasant. 

Our standard room was slightly on the small side; the interior rooms look onto an empty courtyard and straight into the rooms opposite - luckily some of our party were in the room opposite else our curtains would have been permanently closed. Otherwise, the decor was very modern and there are no complaints about its cleanliness.

We had both dinner and breakfast; both we delicious and served promptly for such a large party. There is a big selection of both cold and cooked food at breakfast time. 

The hotel sits along Great Victoria Street - close to the train station and right next door to the Grand Opera house. There's lots of restaurants in and around the area and convenience stores incase you need to grab bottles of water or snacks. City Hall is less than 5 minutes away.",4,2015,08,27
226,Lazy Sunday,"Amazing hotel , stayed for the lazy Sunday offer , 4 course meal with b and b, for great price , everything was fantastic.Beautiful hotel with a dedicated team. The deserts were so stunning I had to go back to the room to get my camera. Brilliant .",5,2015,08,26
226,Fabulous,"Stunning hotel in great location!!

Rooms are spacious and modern! Big comfortable beds!

I love the black sleek design very classy!

Good atmosphere in hotel. Friendly helpful staff and good food at breakfast and at dinner!

Stayed here for business but would return for leisure. ",5,2015,08,25

Gemma and I will be back.",5,2015,08,25
226,Great location,"This was our 1st visit to Belfast and we are glad we chose the Fitzwilliam. The hotel itself is modern and tastefully decorated/furnished, rooms large and clean and comfortable. Large bed with comfy linens, robes, bath and shower and toiletries.

A few issues with the wifi but these were rectified shortly and hotel staff all very helpful and more than happy to assist with booking tours/tickets etc

The hotel is only a 5 minute walk to shopping plazas and the Crown Bar/saloon across the road - a must visit for a pint of Guinness! 

The hotel food menu is fresh and good portion sizes, there is a small gym which is good for working out, bar/lounge has a relaxed atmosphere.

",4,2015,08,24
226,Fantastic!!,"My husband and I stayed in the Fitzwilliam for our anniversary and I can't recommend it enough. 

We opted for the Sunday night deal which included dinner and breakfast the next morning. The staff were friendly, the food was amazing and the room was beautifully decorated and quiet. This hotel should really be a five star!",5,2015,08,24
226,Great Hotel,"Have stayed here a few times and always had a great time. The Concierge is always very helpful. The hotel itself is spotless, and friendly. The room we had was lovely and light with their floor to ceiling windows, view is ok just looking across to Jury‚Äôs hotel, and the church. 
Location is great with shops and bars and restaurant on your door step. And if you ever get lost just look for the big F at the top of the building",5,2015,08,24
226,Cant wait to stay again,"Beautiful modern hotel with city centre  location. The staff are so helpful and friendly. Cocktail bar was delicious. We stayed in suite and it is just gorgeous, views of city are amazing. Didnt have any food but would love to dine here in future",5,2015,08,23
226,A real 5 star. Worth every penny!,First time staying in a Fitzwilliam hotel and i had heard great things. All my expectations were met and we really enjoyed the spacious superior double room. The little touches were fantastic such as the candle and matches in the bathroom and the classical music playing when we first entered. Everything was perfect and the staff were the most helpful and obliging that i have come by yet!,5,2015,08,21
226,Amazing!,"We were staying only one night in Belfast to visit with family and spend more time in the city. 
Our stay at the Fitzwilliam couldn't have been more perfect. The staff were friendly and attentive and the hotel is beautiful! 
Our wall of windows provided an incredible view and the enormous walk in shower was a pleasant surprise! The bed was incredibly comfortable and the room was well appointed. 
The location is ideal as it's within a short walk to shops, restaurants and pubs. The Titanic exhibit is a ¬£6 taxi ride and the Black Cab tour was interesting and informative. 
We had lunches, breakfast and cocktails at the hotel and we were happy with it all!
It was a wonderful experience from start to finish! Many thanks to the Fitzwilliam staff for providing us with a wonderful stay!",5,2015,08,20
226,Nice place,"Comfy beds, nice rooms! Very friendly staff
Good breakfast. Really enjoyed the bar food. Special thank you to Brian who made our stay so enjoyable. 
Cocktails are delicious. Bar staff went out of there way to make me one that was not on the menu

Good hotel. Would return. ",5,2015,08,20
226,The best cocktails in Belfast,"Great hotel but it is in a city centre so don't expect a fabulous view from your room. We stayed for a whole week so paying ¬£17 per night for the hotel car park would have been very expensive. Instead we bought a ticket at the secure car park just across the from the hotel in Grosvenor Road for only ¬£44 for the week. The hotel is in a good location. Easy to walk to all the city sites and to get to the motorway network to travel further afield. The hotel bar serves the best cocktails and Irish coffee. The restaurant offers a great 'couples' deal, and the food is really good. The staff are all very helpful.",5,2015,08,19
226,Pleasant stay,"The Reception staff were very helpful & efficient. 
The room corridors were very darkly lit. The location was very central & the room was very pleasant although the lighting was quite dim & it was difficult to read the Air Conditioning panel.
The layout of the room was pleasing & roomy. However, although the bathroom was of a good size with a lovely double shower, the shower floor was  soooo slippy, even with the bathmat. 
The bed was massive & sooo comfortable. :) 
the bar area was very pleasant & the staff very friendly. in all areas.
The breakfast was excellent & I appreciated taking individual orders for the hot breakfast making it fresh.",4,2015,08,19
226,Great Hotel,"The location was fantastic right in the centre of town.
Room was lovely, comfy bed and pillows, good mini bar and good bathroom, small bath. Was a bit warm in the room.
Concierge was very good prompt service, parking was expensive at ¬£17 per day 
",4,2015,08,17
226,"Worth the money, a nice treat for the other half! ","My partner and I stayed here for a romantic night away for his birthday. The hotel itself is beautifully presented and the staff are very nice and welcoming. It's in the middle of the city centre, close to clubs and pubs, no taxis needed! We also stayed for the four course meal which was really good, most meals within packages aren't great, but this is the exception, with a good range of choices! The breakfast is really nice too, the fry is freshly made for you and none of this ""self service"" which generally makes the breakfast not worth the money. The bath is spacious and relaxing and the rooms are nice if you want to just chill for a night üòä. I recommend the cocktails at the bar downstairs, they are great and worth the money! Bar staff are also nice, service 100% ",5,2015,08,17
226,Midweek break,"Lovely midweek break in The Fitzwilliam. City centre hotel with easy access to everything. 
Unfortunately they also charge ¬£17 car parking which was not previously advertised and coming from a country where this doesn't happen we felt it was quite absurd! 
Nice bar and restaurant. 
",4,2015,08,17
226,Nice Room,"Stayed here on an overnight stay, great hotel in a perfect location. Room and staff were perfect. We would definately consider using this hotel again for another stay in Belfast.
They have their own small car park close by ¬£17 per night.",5,2015,08,16
226,Sadly disappointed ,"Booked a hotel for Saturday night in Belfast for a romantic night to say I am disappointed is an understatement we had a room by the elevator very noisy constant ping noise when someone calls the lift ask for a room far away. We paid for an upgraded executive room very disappointed view of bird droppings and the air conditioning unit. I've heard lots of good things about this hotel but I wouldn't recommend. Maybe if we had paid ¬£70 more for the suites my opinion prob would have been better. Front desk staff upon check in was very helpful they should be commended. We asked for the mini bar to be emptied it was done free ice and glasses this was a nice touch. Good things about the hotel was the welcome, shower and the breakfast was ok. To sum it up not worth the money and overrated. Don't think I will return to the hotel. ",3,2015,08,16
226,Nice evening,"We recently called in to this hotel whilst in Belfast, we had been somewhere else and wanted to have a few cocktails in a nice place that you did not have to fight to get to the bar. We went to the bar and had a few cocktails, the atmosphere was lovely and drinks delicious, definitely worth a visit, next time we will go for dinner first.",4,2015,08,16
226,Lovely room,"This was my first time in Belfast and this was the perfect hotel. It's in a great location just down from the bus station. I arrived really early due to when my flight was and asked if I could just leave my bag expecting to comeback later to check in but the woman on the desk checked to see if there was a room available and I was able to check in at 10:30am which made my life so much easier. 

The room itself was lovely. I had an executive King room and the decor was nicely done, bed was comfy and the bathroom was awesome. It had a shower, a bath and a shower attached to the bath, all the options you could ever need :) There were just lots of little nice touches. The staff were all very nice and helpful. I would definitely stay here again",5,2015,08,15
226,Lovely room,"My girlfriend and I just stayed the 1 night in Belfast. Hotel staff were lovely, room was outstanding, king size bed is a nice touch. 
Parking is a bit steep at ‚Ç¨25, but that's the only fault really.

If your going to Belfast, do the Black taxi tour, it's one of the best experiences I've ever had in Ireland.",5,2015,08,14
226,Cocktail making and dinner,"Cocktail making evening. Great idea for a hen night great cocktails and bar tender, however it was held in the conference room which lacked any kind of ambience or atmosphere. 4 course meal advertised. Meal nice enough however so little of it can't be sure. Had starter, main and desert. ( I have never eaten 3 courses but with the quantity you needed to). However not sure what the fourth was as it never arrived. Service was exceedingly slow for both drink orders and food. 2 1/2 hours to get through the meal. Very disappointing evening. Will not be returning",3,2015,08,12
226,Luxury,"Booked a studio suite for my boyfriends 30th. Was well worth the money. Very large suite and tastefully decorated. Huge bed, extremely comfortable. Would highly recommend the hotel and would stay again anytime.",5,2015,08,11
226,Fabulous hotel,"I booked a studio suite for an overnight stay. This hotel is perfect. I have stayed here on several occasions over the years since it first opened and have never been disappointed. The staff are fantastic, the hotel is luxurious and spotless. My favourite hotel in Belfast.",5,2015,08,10
226,Weekend treat ,"Spent a lovely weekend at this hotel and was very surprised, we have stayed in quite a few lovely hotels as little treats but the fitzwilliam has been a hidden gem. All staff were fantastic and nothing was any trouble. We spent our evening in the bar despite intending to see the city. The bar will now be top of our list on our next travel to belfast.",5,2015,08,10
226,Family birthday stay,"This is indeed from first appearances a very impressive and modern hotel with welcoming and friendly staff.  The hotel is well located for central Belfast and all of its attractions and amenities.

The rooms are suitable and the bed was extremely comfortable!

There are a few of reasons why I have not given the full 5 rating for this hotel.  The Wi-Fi did not work during our visit, when using the shower, water leaked throughout the ceiling. Probably the most annoying thing though was the constant ding of the elevator, twice everytime it arrived at a floor, there really is no point having a comfortable bed if you are not able to sleep in it! I would implore management to actually spend some time in the rooms and see for themselves.

The last issue is something that would stop me from staying in this otherwise excellent hotel again.",4,2015,08,08
226,Repeat visitor,"Can't fault this hotel from a business or personal perspective. Even though the wifi was down the last night we stayed the way the staff dealt with it was exemplary. Will return again next time am in the city. The staff make this hotel, they can't do enough for you from the reception staff to the concierge to the restaurant and room service staff. Thank you all, a lot of hotels could learn from you. ",5,2015,08,05
226,Great Location,"Excellent location and great service.  Staff are very helpful and go out of their way to ensure you have a great stay. Very central to the city centre and all the popular places to see and visit.  Check out the Crown Bar across from the hotel , one of the oldest in Belfast and very unique!!",5,2015,08,05
226,Bathroom is amazing!,Great service- the concierge booked a great taxi tour for us. Room was awesome- great design. Bathroom was big and clean- had a nice big bathtub. Great proximity to local restaurants and bars. Must go see the Crown bar. Be aware that restaurants close early on Sunday evenings. The hotel bar staff is friendly and attentive.,5,2015,08,03
226,Fantastic ,Stayed in the Fitzwilliam for 2 nights can not fault it at all the room was brilliant staff were always happy and friendly breakfast was lovely city centre is just 5mins walk would recommend it to any 1,5,2015,08,03
226,Great 3 day break,"Stayed here for 3 nights. Hotel was excellent. Staff absolutely the stars without shadow of a doubt. Warm, engaging, funny and just excellent of taking care of what was needed.

Generous rooms. Relaxed atmosphere and overall a cracking hotel full of great charming staff.",5,2015,08,02
226,Special treat,"We were given a voucher by our children for this hotel and went for 4 course meal, bed and breakfast.  It really was a treat!  Staff were lovely and helpful, nothing was too much trouble.  Great that you just pull up in car and they come out, take your luggage in and park your car for you.   The toiletries were really nice too. The location was fabulous for shop, bars, restaurants and theatre if you so wish.  Would be love to stay here again some time.",5,2015,08,01
226,First class hotel treat yourself,Very stylish hotel throughout from reception area to the bar to the rooms. Dont have any complaints great location great hotel room no issues. Would always be my first choice if staying in belfast again,5,2015,08,01
226,Catch up dinner with family,"We had a lovely meal and the staff were very friendly and service was excellent! I've been here a few times and would recommend it. Lovely ambience and decor, very modern and very close to sights if you are visiting the city.",5,2015,08,01
226,Location and Price can't be beat!,"Stayed here for two nights and it made a great jumping off point for our stay.  Very close to one of the the best pizza places I've ever had (Little Italy).  Ate dinner one night at the restaurant and it was a a good meal with a modern atmosphere.  Restaurant was fairly empty at the time (we went early), but felt the server wasn't overly attentive, especially with us wanting to order additional drinks.  There is a small Tesco across the street to grab a quick lunch for the road if you're travelling outside of town for the day.

The rooms are ultra modern with great colours, sleek bathrooms, and comfortable beds.  There's a hidden cabinet by the bed too, which is pretty cool.

We could not find parking here when we first arrived and didn't know where to go for that, which is because they have valet! Just pull up next to the hotel and they will park your car in their designated lot.

This hotel is about as central as you can get.  It is within walking distance to major shopping and the town hall.",4,2015,07,31
226,Classy hotel close to the centre of Belfast,"I have stayed a number of times and of course with that comes the staff getting to know you. That said, I found the receptionists friendly and efficient from day one. The rooms are spacious, clean, modern and well appointed. A large, comfortable bed, large bathroom with new fittings and in most cases a large shower and bath. I haven't eaten in the hotel so can't comment on the food. Overall, recommended for a very comfortable stay.",4,2015,07,31
226,Could have rated it higher but.....,"It's supposed to be at least a 4-star establishment.  In most respects I'd say likely, but.... my experience this time around precluded me from rating it 4-star.  Water issue.  We stayed there 2 nights.  Each time I showered, I just couldn't feel comfortable having to rub my body over and over, thinking it wasn't clean because of the slimy feeling.  The ""hardness"" of its water supply.  This wasn't the 1st time I've experienced, so I KNEW the reason was that the water was tooooo hard.  I mentioned this at the front desk, even with our tour guide standing next.  Yet, nobody offered any comment.  They just didn't ""care""?   I've included this in my comments to the tour operator for our trip also.  See if some pressure can be applied so they fix the hard water issue.",3,2015,07,30
226,Great stay!!,"We selected this hotel as part of a 15 day trip through Ireland.   We found the staff to be helpful and accommodating form the moment of check in.  The concierge service was great. We arrived early due to our travels, expecting to leave our luggage with the desk, they accommodated us with a room right away!  The room was spacious and had a very comfortable bed.  The room was stocked with everything a person could need.  Our room was near the elevator, but we were not bothered with noise.  The breakfast buffet was great.  The hotel was located in a convenient location.  There was lots of shopping, and entertainment and pubs nearby.  Would definitely stay here again!
",5,2015,07,30
226,A Friendly Welcome in the heart of Belfast,"The Fitzwilliam has a really smart elegant feel and look to it , the staff are warm and welcoming and have a wealth of knowledge to help you with your stay, use the conserage staff to help book a Taxi ride tour of the peace wall, the Restaurants are all good but we found Deans just a short walk from the Hotel a real find good selection of meat and fish dishes, book ahead to avoid not being able to get a table, the Hotel also has a great bar to relax after a hard day walking the city.",5,2015,07,29
226,A lovely spot to overnight in Belfast.,"A lovely and modern hotel just down from the Crown Bar and near the bus station and ""Hop On, Hop Off"" bus tour stop. This stay was a bit of luxury for my sister and I, as most of our 2-week visit to Ireland involved B and B's and budget hotels. The staff was helpful and warm, our room was very comfortable, and a really good breakfast was included as part of our package. This stay was booked as part of a Railtours Ireland ""Game of Thrones"" tour, which made this room a great value for us, but I can't speak to the value for other bookings. 

The only negative comment I would make is that the little containers of shampoo, shower gel and conditioner had greasy fingerprints on them. A tiny detail, I know, but it was quite off-putting. On another note, the bar soap provided was particularly nice!",4,2015,07,28
226,Wonderful place to stay in Belfast,"I loved the Fitzwilliam, from the modern decor to the friendly and helpful staff it was an A+ place to stay for our first stay in the city. The rooms are ENORMOUS, and stocked with everything you could possibly need. Located within walking distance to many sights and places of interest, and across the street from one of the very best pizza places I've been to, I'll certainly be telling everyone I know heading to Belfast that they need to stay at this hotel.",5,2015,07,26
226,One of the best in Belfast ,"One of my favourite hotels in Belfast! Great large rooms with big windows and nicely furnished! Also in great location! 

Prices can be somewhat higher than nearby hotels but your paying for a higher quality hotel! Definitely will be returning again.",5,2015,07,26
226,Very nice indeed,"Decor was beautiful. Very modern throughout. Cosmos were lovely, although a tad expensive at ¬£9. We had a superior king room and it was lovely although quite small. Bed super comfy with great pillows! We both really enjoyed our stay there & would recommend. ",4,2015,07,25
226,2nd time amazing!!!,"This was my 2nd time staying here i had a couple of issues with the room as it was near the lift and someone was playing music really loud in the next room.
I had a chat with Carolin and everything was resolved. Amazing service love this hotel sooooo much.
I will be back!!!",5,2015,07,25
226,Very disappointed ,"I booked this hotel through booking hotel. Com and got a really good deal for two nights stay. When I arrived at check in, no booking existed and I had to book in and pay full rate for the five star. I was very disappointed. 

To make the situation worse the other couple we we were with experienced the same thing. We were not treated very well, we even showed the management the prof of booking and they still robbed us. 

To put the icing on the cake, there were drinks charged to my room that I never purchased. 

It's a great looking hotel, not worth the hassle when this carry on is going on. ",3,2015,07,24
226,Excellent as ever.,"Great spot for business or leisure stay. Modern decor. Stellar service and chic suites. Declan the concierge is a gent.
Bar and restaurant both serve good fayre along with a nice wine and cocktail list. Valet parking service very handy. One of the 2 hotels I will only ever stay in when in Belfast.",5,2015,07,24
226,Great Hotel with wonderful service,We needed a place to stay for a night in Belfast and decided on this one due to the reviews.  The staff was very friendly and helpful from check in to check out.  Normally we would go out for dinner but since it was July 11th most places were closed so we had dinner in  their restaurant.  The food was very good as was the service.  It was one of our better meals the whole trip in Ireland.  The rooms were clean and beds were comfortable.  Nothing more I could ask for.  Great place to stay if you are in the area.,5,2015,07,23
226,Family wedding and city break,"Stayed at The Fitzwilliam on 18th July for two nights, as soon as we arrived, the Concierge were on hand to take our bags off us and we could check in straight away.  The rooms were spacious, very clean and lovely, had everything in you needed.  The bed is the most comfiest bed I have ever stayed in and had the best nights sleep whilst I was there. 

The food in the hotel is lovely, and the staff cannot do enough for you they are so efficient and helpful.  This really made our stay more enjoyable.

The first night I ate in the hotel and had room service, I had the Seafood Pasta and it was delicious!  The second night we went to Frattellis Italian which is on the same road as the theatre and very near the hotel and the third night we went to Made in Belfast which is near City Hall.  Very good food and value for money.

The hotel is in a very good location and easy to walk to placed.  We did the open bus tour which would defo recommend.  We bought our tickets from this from the ticket shop opposite the hotel, very helpful in there.  We also did the tour of Crumlin Jail which is also very interesting.  

Had a great time and would defo go back to The Fitzwilliam or recommend it to a friend.",5,2015,07,23
226,A Great Location to Explore Belfast,"A well maintained hotel just down from the Crown Bar and around the corner form the bus station.  Nice rooms, restaurant and service.  The staff is top notch.  Walking distance to many of  the best sites regardless of the weather.  Some street noise and the hourly chiming of the church clock across the street during the average waking hours may annoy some, but not me.",5,2015,07,22
226,Convenient location but disappointing overall,"Valet parking only available. Poor acoustics in room and was facing the road so could hear every car passing,ambulance sirens and people shouting on the street in the early hours of the morning. The rooms were not spotlessly clean. Food was poor for lunch or dinner. breakfast had a great selection and hot and cold breakfast was good.",3,2015,07,22
226,Perfect,"Not much to say about this hotel other than perfect. Location, comfort, staff and everything else. Tops!!! Five circles with dots in the middle üòÄ

Everything was in close proximity and easily accessible. If we are back in Belfast again we will certainly be staying here again!!!!",5,2015,07,22
226,Over-rated hotel,"Stayed here with my husband for our annual Christmas shopping trip, we decided to treat ourselves and stay in this hotel as apposed to our usual 4 stars.  The staff all appear to be stuffy and not that welcoming.  the room was nice paid extra for a corner room which ended up with a view into the side of Jury's hotel.  The TV if you wanted to watch you had to pay for. We ate that evening in the restaurant which was really disappointing and were seated next to the toilets which had a foul smell coming from it, breakfast the following morning (minus the foul smell) wasn't great either small space and not a great selection.  Our friends stayed in the Benedicts Hotel which to be honest had more facilities and nicer room, food was nicer an half the price of what we paid.

Overall really disappointed in this hotel the price you pay for and what you get isn't worth it!",3,2015,07,22
226,Good Hotel,"Stayed at The Fitzwilliam for two nights with my Wife and two American friends.
When we arrived we managed to find the hotel easily but finding somewhere to leave the car proved more difficulty. we had booked valet car parking with the hotel but there was no indication of where to leave the car. In the end you leave the car in a small lay by to the side of the hotel with double yellow lines, you leave your car there and the Concierge moves it for you into a very small car park within the hotel (we could see the car from our bedroom window.) I would suggest that if you are using this service to book it in advance.
The hotel is pretty central to everything in Belfast but I would recommend using the City Sightseeing Hop on Hop off buses which takes you around all the places you may not fancy walking around such as the Falls Road, they delicately explain the origins of the troubles and show you where it happened. I had booked the bus tickets online and found you could buy Combo tickets which gave two days in Belfast and two days in Dublin at a heavy discount and also gave a ¬£5 discount on the Giants Causeway trip.
The hotel is high standard with prices to match ie an Irish Coffee was ¬£7.50.
The room was nice but overlooked a vast array of Air Conditioning plants. The room had bathrobes, slippers and toiletries.
A good class Hotel with pleasant staff and we had no problems although we didn't eat at the hotel.
I would recommend it for a bit of luxury after a two week tour staying at more budget places.",5,2015,07,21
226,Exceeded expectations ,"I booked this hotel as a surprise for my partner as a short break. On arrival the lobby is very impressive. The staff were very welcoming. We were early for check in but the staff helpfully offered to store our bags and provided a map so that we could explore until 14:00. Check in was quick and easy. The room was stunning. We had the executive king room and instantly we were blown away by the elegance. The hotel manager even left some truffles and a personal note congratulating us on our anniversary. The bed was huge and extremely comfortable. I slept really well the whole trip. Which initially I didn't think I would, because the noise from the city hall bell every half an hour. Luckily it stops in the evening and doesn't start until late morning. There are numerous lovely touches to the room. Like complementary shower products. Candle by the bath. Slippers and a dressing gown. We looked forward to breakfast every morning. We were seat quickly in the chic restaurant. There is a good selection of continental food in the buffet. With the addition choice of a hot breakfast. We both chose the full Irish. This included a potato crepe, runny egg, bacon, tomatoes, mushrooms, white and black pudding. And the sausage !!! For us the most important part about a breakfast. It was Devine. The staff were extremely helpful and polite. We thoroughly enjoyed our short time there and would definitely go back. ",5,2015,07,20
226,Veruy Good Stay,"Nice welcome on arrival and efficient check in. Executive Room was spotless and very bright and airy and the massive windows allowed the sun in all day. Nice toilet with large bath and separate walk in shower. Only gripe would be that mat was definitely required as shower base was treacherous and slippy.

Visited the bar a couple of time, prices were as expected and service was attentive and friendly.

Paid for breakfast on the final morning. As a fry up only man I thought it was over priced and the black and white puddings were tiny and didn't compliment the breakfast. However, If you like all your cereals, juices and cold meats with breakfast, it's probably worth your while and overall price is fair for the whole package. 

We would stay again, we just wouldn't opt for breakfast. To be fair though, it's all in all a very good hotel.",5,2015,07,20
226,Overnight Stay and Afternoon Tea,"My boyfriend and I are just back from an overnight stay at this hotel; we found a deal which was one night in an executive room, with a four-course meal and breakfast the next day. Although we both go to uni in Belfast, and therefore know the city quite well, I think this would be the perfect hotel to stay in for someone who had never visited before, as it's a three minute walk from the city centre, and not even one minute from the train station, where there's a direct bus to Belfast International airport. 

At the check in desk, the woman was incredibly helpful and welcoming, and went through all of the details of our stay. We got to our room on the seventh floor, and it was so beautiful; I actually couldn't believe how pretty it was! Huge bathroom, with black tiles everywhere, an amazing shower (and bath!). The wardrobe with nightgowns, slippers, a safe, umbrella and lots of hangers for your clothes. The bed was MASSIVE, and very comfortable. The view wasn't initially amazing, but after a while I noticed that beyond the buildings, you could see the mountains, which are lovely. The decor is something the hotel should be proud of- I'd describe it as simplistic, quirky and modern- unusual but stunning colour scheme. 

Dinner was also lovely- we had our four course meal, although the definition of ""four course"" was a little different to what we assumed, as the sides count as a course. Nevertheless, everything was cooked to perfection, and our servers were really pleasant. 

Breakfast was also pretty good! A small continental buffet and a menu you can order from as well. Also served in the same restaurant, which is beautifully lit. We had a nice little booth for both of our dining experiences, which made it feel quite private, and that was lovely. 

As we had booked in for afternoon tea, we asked to leave our bags with the concierge (our check in time was 12, and tea was later that day), who was SO cute and happy to help. We took our tea in the bar, and had a nice glass of prosseco while we waited. The selection of sandwiches and desserts wasn't bad- the scones were definitely my favourite part!

Some cons however that let this lovely hotel down- I'm not one for complaining either, but in this case, seeing as there were more than one, and I know how helpful reviews can be!
Firstly, breakfast- I was happy enough to eat from the buffet, but my boyfriend wanted to order something from the menu. However, every time he tried to get the attention of any of the staff, they didn't seem to see him... I've worked in a cafe before, I know it can be stressful to try and keep everyone happy, but he made it clear he wanted someone to come over, and I started to think he was being ignored.
Secondly, the afternoon tea. Our server was really nice, but unfortunately there was some kind of problem with the computer, and the order for our afternoon tea to be prepared didn't go through? Which meant that we were waiting for half an hour after our tea/coffee came. Also, by the time things did arrive, the sorbets were melted, which was a little bit nasty. But still, it totally wasn't her fault! Also, we had tea in the bar, which I imagine would be quite nice at night for a wee drink, but I don't think it was a great setting for our lunch. It's quite dark- they might think about holding it elsewhere?

Overall, we really enjoyed ourselves. We had a great wee getaway in beautiful surroundings. What's really good is that this hotel really does cater for everyone; while the design is modern, we saw lots of older people too, who were also having a fabulous time! I think one thing I really appreciated is how we were treated- sometimes, being 20, you kind of worry about going into somewhere so fancy, but all the staff were very respectful and nice, and I really appreciated being treated like an adult- you don't always find that!!!!

Some pieces of advice i would give- if you're looking for somewhere nice to have afternoon tea, the Hilton is slightly cheaper, and has a better selection. The stuff we had was alright, but I ended up leaving a lot of the desserts which normally DOES NOT happen with me! Another thing- if you want a really good feed, eat elsewhere and spend the night here. While our food was really amazing, we'd been saving ourselves for that meal all day, so we were so hungry. The portion sizes weren't bad, but we did kind of want a feast after our long day's adventures! The food is almost definitely quality over quantity. My boyfriend also said avoid the coffee, as it was not nice! Above everything though, cannot be beaten in terms of comfort and class.",4,2015,07,19
226,Loved our stay ,"We stayed in the fitzwilliam for one night only, and didn't want to go home. Absolutely loved this hotel, the room was so modern and clean. Staff was also very helpful and couldn't do enough for there guests. Although when we did get there our TV was broke, though it did get sorted. Went to go get a shower to find the shower hose had holes the whole way up it therefore the water was going everywhere, nothing major but that was the only thing we could fault about this hotel. ",5,2015,07,19
226,Best hotel in Belfast,So glad I booked this for my husband and son. I had booked a game of thrones tour and searched so many hotels in Belfast. They said staff were very helpful and professional and hotel was impeccable. The best location. They dud not eat in the restaurant. It loved the bar. Rooms were very clean and comfortable.,5,2015,07,19
226,Worked great for us!,"Most everyone who had raved about Ireland to us for years never mentioned Belfast. Understandable given the Troubles over recent decades. But that is in the past. More industrial and still a touch grittier than Dublin, we are glad we spent a couple of days there. The Titantic museum is impressive in many ways, including as a very cool architectural effort. There were many tourists in town and you could get a good sense those with whom we came into contact were pleased we were thwre. The hotel was right for us; price, location cleanliness and service.",4,2015,07,19
226,Magical Christmas,"We booked here to stay for the Christmas markets. 
Fab hotel close to the markets and the cocktails where lovely. Staff where lovely too and very helpful. 
Can't say much more we only spent the one night but will definitely be booking for next years markets.",5,2015,07,18
226,Great hotel with superb restaurant,"The Fitzwilliam is a well-located, nicely designed hotel with very good service and  an absolutely outstanding restaurant.

We stayed there on a great package which included dinner and breakfast and tickets to Titanic Belfast.  This turned out to be an excellent choice.

The Fitzwilliam Belfast is really well located as it is amazingly close  to the main Belfast bus terminal. For us this was great as  we came in straight from Dublin airport with an excellent bus connection.  You take  a very comfortable inter-city bus bus right at Dublin Airport and two hours later you are in Belfast a block away from the hotel.  The area around the hotel is OK.  It is next to the Grand Opera House and there are some very good pubs nearby and city  tour buses stop right at the corner. 

Rooms were large and well designed as was the bathroom which had both a huge tub with hand shower as well as a separate shower stall.  The only comment I would make -- and that is not the hotel's fault but that of the designer is that in this nice and large bathroom with every amenity offered that there should be a bit more space allocated to shelves where one can put one's toiletries.

The staff is very friendly and the concierges are great at arranging tours and also at answering an tour-related questions prior to arrival after one makes a booking. The managerial staff is also really well customer-oriented.

One of the outstanding features was the restaurant where we had one dinner and our breakfasts.  The food selection is not only top of the line and beautifully presented but it really delicious -- both a superb dinner and fabulous breakfasts.

If in Belfast again, we would not hesitate to stay once more at the Fitzwilliam.",5,2015,07,18
226,Great place to stay,"The recommendations from TA pointed towards the Fitzwilliam. It was very centrally located with most things within easy walking distance. The Crown is a good bar, and several restaurants nearby The Square and Ginger Bistro were both excellent. Nice bar on the Ground floor open till late. Service at Reception was brilliant, usually 3 smiling faces and always trying to help, booking in/out as easy as it gets. Recommend this hotel most highly. Was on 7th floor no street or hotel noise.",5,2015,07,18
226,Perfect for a City Break,"Stayed here overnight in a superior room and it was great.

Lots of little extras including shortbread, robe and slippers and even a candle by the bath meant this stay was very comfortable. 

Loved the extra big bed and blackout curtains... Best nights sleep I'd had in a long time. 

The cocktail bar in the hotel had a lovely atmosphere and was great to have right there.

Excellent location in the centre, just up from the popular 'Crown Pub'.

Staff were very friendly and helpful.",5,2015,07,17
226,Comfortable hotel with Excellent Staff,"I booked a 5-star hotel in Belfast but then I changed my mind to Fitzwilliam after I have seen many good recent reviews and it was a really good decision. 

When I arrived in the hotel, I was so surprised that the hotel staff already knew my name! They already prepared the check-in form with everything filled in ‚Äì I just needed to check the information again and sign! The check-in procedure only took me 2 mins and the reception staff Natalia was very nice, friendly and helpful. 

The next day I wanted to join a Game of Thrones tour but they were either full or not available on the days I was in Belfast. The concierge staff Stephen and Phillip discussed the options with me and helped me arrange a private tour. They were helpful and I really appreciated that.

The room was very comfortable! The room was very well-designed and everything was comfortable - the carpet, the mattress and the blanket! I was a bit worried there would be a heat wave and I couldn‚Äôt sleep well but as the room was air-conditioned, I had no worries at all.

The bathroom was very spacious, with a bathtub and a separate overhead shower place. I enjoyed my stay very much. And remember to try the shower gel and shampoo! They all smell very good.

Tips: I could not find the kettle and the minibar in the room, it‚Äôs actually in the cupboard just next to your bed. Have a look of one of the pictures I uploaded!

(Just one complaint - the wifi was quite slow but since it's complimentary I couldn't complain much...)",5,2015,07,17
226,Fantastic Hotel For Business Travellers,"I stayed at this hotel for 3 nights over June and found it to be very good.

Over the course of my stay I was able to sample a lot the hotel has to offer including the restaurant, the bar and other facilities. While there were some small glitches such as an item being missed from the room service order or the tap not working everything was resolved as quickly as possible.

The staff can't be more friendly, they were excellent throughout. In particular KRISTIANA and AIDAN  both had excellent customer service skills and were able to explain the menu as well as recommend. Well done Guys. 

Negatives: Dined for dinner twice and couldn't help noticing how busy it can get, although service and quality of everything is good, more staff is needed. 

Overall I'd recommend this place as a vibrant and charming hotel. While you may have the odd small issue which can occur in any hotel, rest assured the staff will do everything they can to put things right. 

Well done Fitzwilliam Hotel...",5,2015,07,17
226,Beautiful hotel with unpleasant staff,"The Fitzwilliam in Belfast is truly a beautiful hotel with seemingly luxurious decor. The rooms and bathrooms are spacious and very clean. The breakfast was pretty good. However, the staff, especially at the front desk left much to be desired. I walked in to the front desk to check in and the lady at the front didn't even make eye contact with me. I had to draw her attention. She was very unapproachable. I thought perhaps she was just having a bad day (we all do) but she behaved just as poorly the following day. Also, on our second day, neither my husband nor I could connect to the WiFi and not a single person was able to help us. Not every staff member was impolite but the few that were left a bad taste and we probably won't return to this hotel. You can keep your fancy decor. I prefer quality customer service over fancy furniture.",3,2015,07,16
226,Lovely Hotel,"We stayed here last August when in town for a concert, and again this June when staying for a wedding.

Hotel is immaculate, lobby is lovely and front desk are very polite and helpful. Rooms are large with very comfortable beds, the bathrooms are great and I loved the shower! The corridors are a little dark but I think that adds to the chic feel of the hotel.

Cannot comment on food or bar area as we did not visit, however when I come back to Belfast I'll be booking in here again.

",5,2015,07,14
226,Another great stay,"Have stayed here before and this time we were not disappointed, staff are very friendly and helpful. Location is perfect for spending time in the city and parking is reasonable. Breakfast is very nice good choice and we ate in the bar which was also good. ",4,2015,07,14
226,6 Stars,"A quick visit to Belfast for work meetings and I always stay at The fitzwilliam Hotel. I love the friendly welcoming staff and the real sense they care about your visit. I'm regular so I always a word or two with whoever checks me in.

The rooms are very comfy and the beds are the best nights sleep I can get (except my own super king size). Nothing is too much trouble.

Breakfast is a wonderful experience, great food and a great start to the day.

Took a client for dinner in the Hotel restaurant, as always the staff aim to please and are attentive and offer useful suggestions, Chris is usually on hand to throw some advice in or a glass of Prosecco!! The food was outstanding, the fillet steak was divine and cooked perfectly. My clients had not eaten in the Hotel before and were very impressed.

I try and stay twice if not three times a month and The Hotel is My only choice in Belfast",5,2015,07,12
226,Average lunch,"I ate here last summer when attending a show in the Grand Opera House. It was pricey for what I got and nothing special. I was disappointed as I was treating myself . I won't be back. Will go to one of the other near by restaurants instead. Probably more suited to business lunches although the service was slow.
",3,2015,07,12
226,"Hard to Beat - Modern, Comfortable, Excellent Location","Stayed 2 nights in June 2015.

The hotel is ideally located within easy walking distance to City Hall (central Belfast).  We enjoy walking and easily walked to Titanic Belfast and back.  The Europa bus station is almost next door and Belfast Central train station is a five pound taxi ride away (recommend using Value Cabs which provide reliable, clean taxis that can be trusted not to rip you off).

Our room was spacious, clean, quiet and included a three seat sofa, work area, small flat screen TV, radio and sound player, in-room safe, free WiFi with good speed, adjustable air conditioning.

Our bathroom was modern with separate bath and shower and a good selection of toiletries.  

Check-in/out was quick and easy with extremely friendly and helpful reception staff.

Highly recommended and would certainly stay here again based upon modern, comfortable rooms and excellent location.",5,2015,07,10
226,Another Amazing Stay,"From check-in to check-out everything and everyone were amazing . The Fitzwilliam is simply the best hotel in Belfast , it has everything a guest could want .The staff are amazing , the Hotel has everything in aboundance and more . We have stayed here often but it gets better every time . Cannot wait to return .",5,2015,07,10
226,Favorite part of Belfast!,"We stayed here for 3 nights on our trip. The hotel is in a great location with a beautiful interior. The rooms are very posh and modern. Very well kept, a nice room to relax in. Staff was nice and welcoming. One thing I enjoyed about the hotel was their laundry service. They have the regular expensive laundry like ""6 pounds per underwear"" but at the bottom they have a "" bag wash, dry, and fold"" for 15.80 pounds. So basically fill the bag up and they will clean it. This was particularly amazing as we were halfway through our trip and needed laundry. I recommend valeting your car because parking looked hard to find. They ask that you email them your valet request when booking your room.  Overall a great stay and a highlight of our trip.  ",5,2015,07,09
226,Great hotel - excellent location. ,"I have just completed a three night stay at the Fitzwilliam Hotel in Belfast. This is a lovely hotel and right in the centre of things. Belfast is small, but this is perfectly positioned to walk to the city centre. The staff are really lovely and the concierge was so helpful. One concierge (I wish I could remember his name)helped to organise a black cab tour for me of the political murals - this was seriously one of the highlights of my stay. He also helped me get my bearings and was patient as I really have no sense of direction! The hotel itself is very clean and comfortable, also quiet. I had a lovely bath in my room and really appreciated this after a day out walking. I notice some people comment on the dark hallways - but honestly this is not a problem. My package included breakfast which was substantial and nice. As a single female traveller I cannot recommend this hotel more highly. If I am ever lucky enough to be in Belfast again this is where I will stay. ",5,2015,07,08
226,Stylish well placed hotel,"The Fitzwilliam is a stylish hotel very much in the mould of the Malmaison group; dark crisp tones for the rooms and corridors. I was particularly impressed with the large walk in shower and the comfiness of the queen sized bed.

we didn't avail ourselves of the restaurant, preferring to eat out so cannot comment on the quality of dinner or breakfast although I did feel the cost of breakfast (¬£16) on top of the cost of the room represented poor value. Overall though this did not detract from our enjoyment of this hotel due to its position to lots of Belfast's attractions and good local pubs and restaurants.

We were also particularly pleased that the bells from the local cathedral stopped chiming at 9 so we got a very good nights sleeps.",4,2015,07,07
226,Brilliant!,"My partner proposes to me in December in this hotel! The room he'd booked wasn't ready in time for us checking in and the room was upgraded at no extra cost! Very clean and extremely comfortable! So glad he booked this hotel for this special occasion. Has the simplest, clean looking decor which makes it even nicer in my opionon. Nicer than most other places we've seen in Belfast. No weird patterns or materials! Will absolutely stay again. 
It was a one night stay and I didn't see it interact with any staff but they all seemed well kept and professional. :) quiet for a Friday and Saturday. It's literally right beside great Victoria street train station which is petrify for anyone who isn't local or doesn't know their way around Belfast. 
Very happy with this hotel!",5,2015,07,07
226,Worth a stay,"Just returned from a long weekend in the Fitzwilliam Hotel and enjoyed the experience very much. Reception staff very welcoming and check in was quick.  The room (executive suite)  was large, very clean with good air conditioning and great decor. Bathroom had a seperate shower and full size bath. We were on the 7th floor so had good view over the city it was very quiet at night we did not experience any noise from neighbouring rooms. Location was fabulous, close to the the shops and walkable distance to the centre of town and down to the Titanic Quarter.",5,2015,07,07
226,One of my favourites! ,"This hotel will always be a special one to me! Was the first hotel I stayed in with my fianc√© (then boyfriend) and where we got engaged! We have stayed here around 5/6 times! Staff are fantastic and friendly, rooms are absolutely beautiful with stunning decor, the bar is beautiful with some lovely cocktails, restaurant is also lovely! Breakfast is a buffet selection with also the choice to have something freshly made off a menu, Eggs Benedict is gorgeous! Really couldn't say enough good words about it! Was going to get married here only the function room is way too small :(",5,2015,07,07
226,Fabulous,"Had an awesome stay at the Fitzwilliam hotel in Belfast. A real treat.  Staff were lovely and helpful. Bedroom was class very comfortable. I would highly recommend this hotel.
Thanks again for a wonderful stay",5,2015,07,07
226,A good hotel centrally located,"The Fitzwilliam is a good hotel and centrally located. The receptions are very welcoming and friendly, the concierge is very helpful and knowledgable. The room was large with plenty of natural and artificial light; the electric lights in the bedroom were all dimmer switch controlled; the lights in the bathroom could have been a bit brighter. The bathroom was large with separate bathtub and large separate shower. The shower floor was very slippery and the one anti-skid mat was not sufficient to ensure a safe exit with wet feet. This was solved rapidly with the addition of a second anti-skid mat. There was a lot of shelve area to comfortable layout your toiletries. The king bed was two singles pushed together with a noticeable gap in the middle. We loved the ambiance of the restaurant, although large it achieved an intimate feeling. The restaurant staff were very efficient but  some were a little stand offish. Included breakfast was not the most comprehensive but more than adequate. Probably wouldn't stay there again if our travels bring us back to Belfast.",5,2015,07,06
226,Fab,Stayed here with my girlfriend last month. Have to say was really fab. Will be back. Really clean and nice staff. Great central location with easy access into belfast centre. Bathrooms really modern and breakfast good.,5,2015,07,06
226,Great location,"Just spent two nights here with my husband.  Its in a great location - within walking distance of all the sights in central Belfast.  The staff are friendly and helpful and the rooms are well appointed - they have everything you need (e.g. hairdryers), and there are nice White Company toiletries in the bathroom too.  However, if you want a bottle of water, I suggest you pop to the Tesco Express across the road as its ¬£3 a bottle from the mini bar in the room.

The central location means there is some traffic noise but thankfully the nearby clock tower does not start striking the hour until 9.00am,  We had a snack in the bar on our first evening which was very good - didn't try out the restaurant.  Saw some ladies enjoying afternoon tea by the fire on Saturday afternoon - it looked amazing.",5,2015,07,06
226,Lovely Hotel!,"Loved our visit here! It was my first trip to Belfast and this hotel made it that much better! The check in process was easy and very pleasant. The concierge was probably the highlight. They were so friendly and booked us The Black Taxi Tour (which was a highlight of our entire trip to Ireland). Our room was so comfortable and the decor was great. I rarely take baths in hotels, but this one was the exception. It was HUGE. Room service was delicious. I ordered Chicken Curry and my husband had salmon. 

Check out was easy too. Just had to drop the keys off in an envelope in a box at reception. 

Overall, great stay!",5,2015,07,05
226,Very comfortable stay ,"Enjoyed a wonderfully stylish room, with a comfortable bed and great shower. Room was well whipped with stereo and old fashioned telephone. Great show and bathroom. However the shower leaked and flooded the bathroom. Which made the bedroom carpet smell of damp. 

Good breakfast and friendly staff ",4,2015,07,04
226,Graduation Dinner,"Our family of six booked a meal here to celebrate our son's graduation . The staff were very accommodating & pleasant . The menu offered a good choice & it was unusual that the steak had no supplement on the set menu . Our daughter is dairy intolerant & she was offered suitable alternatives at every course , which hasn't happened in many other restaurants . 
However the main thing that brought the standard down was the delivery of the main course . Five people had steak ( which was delicious ) but the steak was on the table over ten minutes before the sides & sauce were delivered which was disappointing . There also was no mustard available when one of us requested it. Also my chicken dish lacked the vegetables which the menu had stated were included . 
We would certainly return but hope the kitchen service would be better .",4,2015,07,04
226,Wish we could have stayed longer!,"This is truly one of the nicest hotels we have ever stayed at.  Our room was amazing.  The restaurant was excellent, and the staff was so friendly and helpful.  Our stay at the Fitzwilliam could not have been any better!",5,2015,07,03
226,Great location,"Stayed here December 14 to do some Christmas shopping and see the Christmas markets. Location great for both, esp the markets! Had a few drinks in the bar which was lovely and modern but the cocktails were a little pricey - tasted great though! Would stay here again if I got a good deal but think there are cheaper hotels close by which are just as nice.",4,2015,07,03
226,Was there for the Neil diamond concert,Lovely hotel great staff wonderful food .stayed 30.6.15was in Belfast for a concert .It is a beautiful city .will certainly go back for a longer visit The food in the restaurant was first class and the breakfast was also very good .would definitely stay at that hotel again,5,2015,07,02
226,Terrific location. Great breakfast. Lovely rooms,"Tastefully decorated, quiet and well located hotel.
Blackout curtains which was a blessing as this was our first location and we needed to get into the time zone and over jet lag.
Staff warm and helpful.
Terrific breakfast. Lovely omelette. Gluten free options were a few types of cereal, toast and all the usual things (omelettes, eggs, bacon).
Matresses need replacing as inconsistent with the rest of the place - have seen better days and quite saggy and have lost much of their support.",5,2015,06,30
226,Best hotel in the city of belfast,"Freindly staff nicwe clean room great people fantastic location.

226,"Lovely hotel , fabulous  staff","Just enjoyed a night in the Fitzwilliam hotel. The valet service makes parking a breeze. 
Well appointed room. Lovely sized shower with large shower head. Very comfortable large bed.
Had cocktails in the bar and a very enjoyable and speedily delivered breakfast in the restaurant . 
Though the thing that makes this hotel is the staff. They are all so cheerful and friendly. Looking forward to staying again.",5,2015,06,30
226,Great hotel in the city center,"The Fitzwilliam hotel in Belfast is a nice, clean hotel and is  within walking distance to many attractions, pubs and restaurants. The hotel is new and modern, the rooms are quite and the staff provides great customer service. The bar is open for hotel guests as late as they want to stay which is nice because pubs in Belfast close easy. ",4,2015,06,28
226,Very central,"stayed for 2 nights in mid June, had room on 8th floor. Lovely spacious modern room with amazing bathroom. We ate one evening in restaurant - the food was lovely but it was very quiet, possibly due to Monday night. Also the bar was very quiet so we went to Robinson's which was lively for a Monday night. We went in to the Europa Bar but disappointed as could do with a makeover AND they don't sell Merlot wine!!!!  Breakfast in the hotel was lovely with a great selection of fresh fruit, cheeses and a beautiful fresh cooked breakfast. The reception staff and Dermot the concierge were very helpful. Took the concierge option and was worth the extra money. Flame is an excellent restaurant just down the street as is the Bakery cafe for lunch. j",4,2015,06,27
226,If your paying 5 star you want it all 5 star!,"This hotel has a great location, staff are very friendly and go out of their way to be helpful.
Had pre theatre meal which was spectacular.
Breakfast is also a must, great variety of food 
Reception, dining and bar areas are all 5 star and very well presented.
However on entering the lift we noticed the lampshade was hanging off, a dark gloomy corrider meets you when you leave the lift.
Bedrooms look the part but on closer inspection are in need of some much needed tlc.
Broken, chipped tiles in bathroom, poor running shower, chipped woodwork, stained torn carpets and ripped duvet cover!
Not what you would expect from a 5 star hotel
Its a shame the rooms let them down abit.

226,A great location for sightseeing.,"Perfectly situated for sightseeing and right opposite a tourist office!  Short taxi ride (less than ¬£10) from George Best City airport and very easy to walk to most of the sights from here as well as being  right by one of the City Sightseeing Tour Bus stops.  The hotel was comfortable (very good beds, larger than average rooms and bathrooms with large walk in shower and bath),  well appointed, good value, and had everything you need for  a sightseeing visit to Belfast, plus Wonderfully friendly and helpful staff....which after a while in Belfast you come to expect as the norm, as without exception everyone you meet in this city is charming, friendly and generally delightful.",5,2015,06,23
226,Great location,Great location. Quick efficient friendly check in. It was strange that the restaurant and bar have no real windows and felt a bit boxed in. The breakfast was super. Corridors are strangely dimly lit as others have commented. Rooms are lovely. Would stay again but only if I got a special offer rate. Found it a bit expensive overall.,4,2015,06,22
226,Lazy Sunday!,"Fabulous from check in to check out. Room 502 ranks among the best hotel rooms we have stayed in with wonderful views of Belfast. The extra touches enhanced our stay - White Company toiletries, real coffee and cafeti√®re, tea lights on bath and stunning classical music on the stereo. We dined in the restaurant and the food and service were very good. This is definitely our hotel of choice in Belfast.",5,2015,06,22
226,Good location and friendly service,"I picked this hotel because of its central location. Everything was pretty much as we expected - a comfortable room, good breakfast and friendly service. I was worried about the noise in the room when we checked in - we could clearly hear traffic and church bells in our room. Fortunately everything quietened down at night so there were no problems. The staff were very friendly and helpful and the reception gave us some good recommendations for bars and restaurants. All in all a good stay. The only niggle was the very dark corridors in the hotel. Turn the lights up please!",4,2015,06,22
226,Very nice hotel,"After a night in the terrible Hilton in Nottingham this hotel in Belfast was a welcome sight. The reception staff were welcoming and well presented. The location of the hotel is central just a few minutes walk from the fabulous Belfast town hall and the great pubs and bars.
The room was spacious and well planned with a huge bathroom with separate shower.
Safe in the room, good size wardrobe and all of the other kings you expect in a 4 star hotel.
One tip for parking though, they do a valet parking service which if I'd known about i'd have used. Instead I used the parking across the street which was fine but if it had been raining, which it does a lot, it would have been annoying.
A great location for visiting this beautiful city.
Cooked breakfast is not cheap but the choice is good and the food exceptional.
Thanks to the team at the hotel.",4,2015,06,20
226,Surpassed expectations ,"Wow! From check-in to check-out everything was spot on. The staff was courteous and friendly, the room was comfortable and clean. The breakfast was delicious. It was a 5-10 min stroll from city hall/castle court. You will not regret staying here!",5,2015,06,19
226,All those small issues gone!,"This is my second visit to this hotel on business.  I had intended to stay in the cheaper hotel I had used on my last visit but it was fully booked so came back here.  So pleased that there are now biscuits on the in room tea tray, products in the bathroom, granola and yoghurt at breakfast.  Very comfortable bed really beats the cheaper hotel hands down.  Nice clean bathroom with good shower.  Really only one small issue is that lighting in the bathroom is not good enough.  Will choose this hotel next time definitely.  Wifi works too.",5,2015,06,19
226,Short stay,Comfortable room with a decent bathroom. Did eat here so can't comment on dining. Staff at check in were polite and welcoming. Central location with lots of restaurants within walking distance. Overall a very pleasant experience. Would recommend for couples or groups of adults. ,5,2015,06,17
226,Favourite Belfast hotel,"I love the Fitzwilliam in Belfast. I booked a room when I was home at Christmas and it was great value for money. I would consider it one of the best hotels in Belfast but definitely not the most expensive - amazing food, cocktails and atmosphere. The staff are excellent!",5,2015,06,16
226,Perfect night away!,We stayed here for a Christmas shopping break and had an amazing time.  The hotel is centrally located to the shops and bars. The staff were very friendly and helpful.  Rooms were beautiful an the food was delicious.  What more could you ask for.  I will definitely be back here.,5,2015,06,15
226,Best gin cocktail ÔøΩÔøΩ,"I popped in to the Fitzwilliam for a quick drink after work, Melony one of the bar staff was incredibly knowledgeable, she recommended having a gin based cocktail, rasberry infused premium gin, was what I was given, I can only say it was by far the best after work drink I have ever experienced and highly recommend a visit for anyone after a stressful day at the office!",5,2015,06,15
226,Very nice hotel,Great spacious room. Great service and good food. Very friendly and helpful staff. Checked-in earlier in the day than booked which was a bonus.  Good location in Belfast with bars and restaurants close to the hotel.,4,2015,06,14
226,"Over rated and over priced, but very well located to the centre of Belfast","Not really impressed by what is meant to be one of Belfasts best hotels. Dark corridors, dim lights strange colour scheme in bedroom, not really my thing. On a plus note, good locations and friendly staff.",3,2015,06,13
226,One of my best hotel experiences,"The Fitzwilliam may have the most ideal layout of any hotel I have ever experienced. and I have been in very many! The FW is not opulent, but very well appointed. this is what I prefer. I had a corner room with windows on two sides and it was a joy to have such light and feel a part of the vibrant city of Belfast. The concierge service was exceptional and started months before I arrived. Dermot made so many things possible for me in my short amount of time, he will always be part of my wonderful memories of Northern Ireland. The bed was very comfortable, the desk space and closet space was great for my four night stay. With the corner room, the seating was exceptional in the use of relatively modest space but a sense of seating that added value to the sleeping area. I will not stay anywhere else in Belfast, and I hope to return to this city that is alive with striving and accomplishment. My experience makes me want to stay at Fitzwilliam properties in other parts of Great Britain. Thanks, once again, to Trip Advisor for steering me to a great experience.",5,2015,06,12
226,A proper Irish welcome,This a very well designed hotel. The rooms are spacious and well planned. The staff are very friendly and helpful. The breakfast was great - one of the best omelettes that I have eaten. The only vague criticism that I have is the design of the bar which is impersonal.,5,2015,06,12
226,Weekend break ,"A good hotel if you fancy a weekend break in the city , rooms well equipped and clean . Bar does great cocktails haven't tried the restaurant as we always eat out when staying in Belfast , breakfast good but not great good location if traveling by bus 300 yards from bus depot would recommend to stay here and will stay again ",4,2015,06,11
226,Lovely Hotel,"My self and my husband were given a 'voucher' as a gift from our daughters and chose to use it for our  wedding anniversary. After a few hiccups regarding the voucher we were given a room on the 7th floor.   A nights B&B is anything but cheap and having stayed in its sister hotel in Dublin  we were expecting great things!! .  Breakfast in the Fitzwilliam, Dublin is without doubt the BEST we've ever had but this is where, sadly, we were very disappointed!  The first pot of tea was cold, the second tasted terrible, the eggs were pale and tasteless and the bacon salty. Pity really. I will say its a lovely hotel right in the middle of Belfast with THE most helpful and friendly staff we've ever met,  they were great! In fact they make IT great!",4,2015,06,11
226,My favorite Hotel in Belfast,"I have stayed here before and was very pleased that Hotel had maintained the high standards I experienced the last time i was here.  Brilliant Staff, Excellenent Service, Central Location, Superb Breakfast and Extremelly comfortable Beds. Its a little on the pricey side but is worth every penny. Free wifi but parking is extra.",5,2015,06,09
226,Great nights sleep ,"I stayed at the Fitzwilliam for one night /
It's one of my favourite hotels in Belfast.

It's a great location right next door to the Opera House and a short walk from lots of restaurants and bars.

The rooms are spacious with a large sofa.  Also big bathrooms with large tube and walkin shower.

But the best bit is the bed - the bedding feels a nice quality and it's really comfy, and black out curtains - I always sleep like a baby and feel invigorated the next day.

Staff are friendly and welcoming.

Only one point I would say is that they could do with more toiletries.  Only one small pot of shower gel which means if you get a bath or shower evening and the Morning you have to slightly scrimp on the usage - it would be nice to have two!
",5,2015,06,09
226,Last minute weekend break ,"Our sports team made  the final so we grabbed the last suite at the Fitzwilliam. It was not cheap but well appointed with large double walk-in shower s good views over the city. The breakfast buffet was high quality, and all the staff helpful and efficient. The consumers were particularly knowledgable and helped make the whole visit, our first to Belfast a success ",3,2015,06,08
226,Amazing Stay,"The best bed in all of Ireland! Super stylish clean rooms, helpful staff and a concierge that went above and beyond. Took all of their recommendations and thankful we did as it made our two short days in Belfast amazing. Will definitely be staying here again! ",5,2015,06,08
226,Visiting Belfast,"It's a lovely hotel. In a wonderful location, right near city centre and near the Europa Bus Station. Stayed in a king bed bedroom. Nice and modern, and a large room. Bathroom are super sleek and the bathtub is beautiful. There is tons of stuff to watch on tv. There are not a lot of outlets, but the mini bar makes up for it. The robes are very rough, almost like they've been washed a million times. There are slippers but they are cheesy. The people at the front desk are so sweet and nice and there's always someone to help you. Right across from a subway and a pizza shop (but it's pricey)! Bring local currency or use a credit card. ",4,2015,06,07
226,Great location in central Belfast.,"Room was excellent.  Clean, well equipped, spacious, close to Robinsons and the Crown and other places to dine and enjoy a Guinness or whatever.    Staff were very good at the front desk and concierge.    Lobby is very comfortable and inviting as we were waiting for dinner quests.   Walking distance to car rental outlets and convenient drop-off/pickup area at the hotel.      Breakfast was excellent and with all of the choices that one could ask for.   We stayed 3 nights seeing Belfast before travelling the Antrim coast and Derry.  We would recommend the Fitzwilliam and we would stay again.",4,2015,06,07
226,Great centre for a short visit to Belfat,"We have just got back from three nights at the Fitzwilliam. Very impressed with the hotel. We were upgraded on arrival (always a good thing) to a corner room, at the end of a corridor. During our entire stay, I don't think we heard another guest. 

Our room was very comfortable, nicely equipped and very clean. Hotel staff were very efficient and friendly- the chamber maids always said hello, which isn't a given in many UK hotels.

We didn't eat in the restaurant but breakfast was included in the rate. The range of food was not as great as some places we have stayed, but still very good and beautifully cooked. Again the staff were very efficient and friendly.

The hotel itself is within easy walking distance of some very good pubs and restaurants and only two minutes away from the Great Victoria Street train and bus station.

I know Belfast has come a long way since the 80s, but we never felt uneasy walking around the neighbourhood, albeit always in daylight.

We would definitely stay there again if we revisit Belfast.",5,2015,06,06
226,Relaxed modern design ,Great hotel have used the brand in Dublin and Aldergrove. Never found fault. Clean Rooms and fast free wifi that hooks up every time. So central !breakfast was excellent and room rate came from an Expedia lucky dip. Good value. Now I have run out of words ! ,5,2015,06,06
226,Great Hotel,"Very nice hotel in the heart of Belfast.  Room was large, Bath had a tub and separate walk in shower.  Had issues with the A/C and the staff immediately fixed it.  Our room faced the street (5th floor) and was extremely quiet.  Breakfast was yummy. If you have a car, spend the money for Valet parking.  Its worth it.",5,2015,06,05
226,Late lunch.,"On Wednesday this week had lunch with 3 other colleagues. Though a bit slow, we were well looked after. Returned today with my wife.The food took ages 40 minutes to arrive, making us late and my wife's order was wrong. However the manager waived the cost.A poor situation was redeemed. Well done Fitzwilliam for taking such action. It is appreciated.",3,2015,06,04
226,Pro 12 Rugby Final,My husband and I stayed overnight after successful Glasgow Warriors final.Everything about the hotel was fantastic.Arrived at hotel at 9 am to drop off our overnight bags to be told that our room was available and that we could have it then.Fantastic start to our long but happy day.Very friendly consierge then parked our hire car and gave us a very useful chat about where to go after the match.Room was immaculate and large with mega huge comfortable bed on the 8th floor.We werent in hotel again till late night drink at the lovely bar(again staff were very nice)Breakfast was standard fare but quick and efficient.Minor grumble was rock hard tooth breaking breadrolls but when we pointed this out they were replaced straight away.That was appreciated by us as it was done with a smile and an apology.Since this hotel was initially fullu booked when we first enquired(as was everywhere due to the rugby and golf)we really really appreciated Jessica from reservations calling us back when they had a cancellation.Now thats great customer service!!Great weekend great result and great hotel.Would highly recommend,5,2015,06,02
226,Birthday weekend May 2015,We celebrated my husband's 60th birthday at The Fitzwilliam with family & friends. We had private dining in the Assembly Room on the 9th floor with fantastic views over Belfast and Cave Hill including Napolean's Nose! The service & food was outstanding and we had a wonderful team of people looking after us. Thanks to all it was very much appreciated. We stayed for 2 nights in a junior suite on the 8th floor (also with fantastic view). This is a beautiful open plan room with lots of space & very comfortable bed. Highly recommend room 817. Friends stayed in Executive King rooms which were well equipped and very comfortable. Great location in city centre as able to walk to lots of tourist attractions. Looking forward to our next visit. Carol & Davy from Glasgow.,5,2015,06,02
226,An enjoyable stay,"Stayed for a quick business trip recently. Located in an excellent part of the city, with access to the centre quick and easy. Fantastic room and in particular, the bathroom was modern and well equipped with a tremendous shower. However, the service was a let down. Don't order from room service as the delivery is ridiculously slow, as if they don't have the capacity to fulfil simultaneous orders. And definitely don't order a cheese board, as it is extremely poor. My advice would be to eat out, as the staff have no morale between them. However, what has brought this review up to a 4 star is the location, cleanliness and high standard of the room.",4,2015,06,02
226,Poor bar service,"Stopped at the Fitzwilliam having left Ten Square for cocktails before a meal. The bar is a strange set up with booths on one side and a large space between them and the bar itself giving a very disjointed feel. Most of the stools had been moved by a group to one area in the middle but they left and we managed to move two seats to a small table. Order was eventually taken for two cocktails and a small plate or breads and tapanade. Managed to get a booth after 10 minutes and breads came but no plates. After a further 10 minute the supervisor asked us were we waiting for anything! Drinks came another 10 minutes after this.

Its not as if there are no staff, its just that they don't seem to do anything except for the bar supervisor - even the manager named him when we asked to not pool a tip but to reward decent service - one person is trying to carry the whole service!

My wife has had very slow service here before on a pre-theatre meal - it does unfortunately seem to be endemic.",2,2015,05,31
226,Firewalls hotel Belfast,"Stayed here last night, what a joke  Faulty Towers, a complete rip off ¬£210 plus ¬£17  for car park breakfast  again a joke ,would advise people to avoid this hotel at all costs. It's expensive and not a 5 star hotel . Some staff needed training and fast, please please manager get your act together and get this hotel sorted......",3,2015,05,31
226,The Wow Factor,"Our first stay at the Fitzwilliam and we were not disappointed! Staff were very friendly and helpful at reception upon arrival. Our room was beautiful and spacious and comfortable. I must say that our bathroom was impeccably clean; the nicest I have seen any of the hotels we have visited! Our dinner from start to dessert was delicious; menu provided a great selection. The bar lounge area is very comfortable and popular? Breakfast was pleasing as well and gave us a great start to the day. We would definitely stay again as we had a wonderful night, the hotel is in a great location, Thanks Fitzwilliam!!",5,2015,05,31
226,3.5 stars nice but no wow factor,"My 2nd stay & although there is nothing ""wrong"" with this hotel, it pales in comparison to my experiences in other local hotels. Room was nice, clean & large. Check in was ok, I arrived early morning after 24 hrs of travelling so I wasn't surprised a room was not ready. The location is great. Food in bar & restaurant good, service was ok -in the bar, the young man was excellent but in the restaurant it was bizarre. The young male waiter was almost too attentive (felt like every 2nd bite I was being asked ""everything alright?""). If this was the only place stayed at on this trip it would've garnered higher marks but the service I received at another hotel (one that was far cheaper) was exemplary so the Fitz is not as memorable, nor am I tempted to stay on my next trip to wonderful Belfast in a few months",3,2015,05,30
226,V nice,"My boyfriend and I stayed here for a bank holiday weekend. It was absolutely fabulous. The room was big and spacious. The hotel as a whole was very clean. The food in the hotel was average. The breakfast was overrated. The dinner was fine: wasn't too exciting. The staff were excellent and incredibly helpful. Overall, it was a very nice hotel and was worth it.",5,2015,05,29
226,2nd to none,"Title says it all, great hotel, great staff, great room and some fantastic food.
Staff were very attentive and great for local information , along with a clean and spacious room equipped with a comfortable bed ,this garaunteed a good sleep after visiting the in house restaurant which couldn't be faulted.",5,2015,05,29
226,May Bank Holiday Weekend Stay,"I booked this holiday for my boyfriend and I for a short one night stay on a bank holiday sunday. We had a lovely experience and really enjoyed the decor and layout of our room. In particular we were really impressed about the bathroom. I wish we would have prolonged our stay as i would have liked to try out some of the facilities offered by the hotel such as room service. The receptionists were nice and gave some good advice on were to go for dinner (we wanted to venture further than the hitel itself) although we did return here for cocktails and drinks in the hotels bar. We really were impressed with the bar but i couldnt help but feel sorry for the two barmen (paul and ciaran) who were run off their feet the whole night. 2 barmen for a bank holiday weekend?? 1st class service was given to me and my boyfriend as we got to know the two barmen who were sooo lovely. There knowledge on drinks were OUTSTANDING and second to none! They gave us quite a laugh! However we were not impressed my breakfast - didnt like the fact that you had to order hot food. We had tea and coffee and got breakfast outside of the hotel, we were not charged for the tea and coffee which was a nice gesture. I think i would stay here again as we had a pleasant stay however i have stayed in the Jurys Inn and although would think more highly of it than the fitzwilliam (excluding bar service). ",4,2015,05,27
226,Just excellent from start to finish!!!!!!,"This was a booking for 7 people, including a wheelchair user. The staff were attentive from the moment we arrived. Very pleasant and helpful and the rooms were so spacious with large bathrooms including a walk in shower and separate bath. Beds were so comfortable.

The wheelchair user had a specially adapted room, which was great.
 We ate in the bar at lunchtime on 2 occasions and the food was always served to all of us at once, very fresh and good value. Breakfast superb, everything you could want. Hot food is cooked fresh for you.

I had an incident with the iron in my room (burnt a coat) Without me having to ask they immediately said they would look into compensating me and when I returned from my meal the manager did just that. In my opinion this was customer service as it should be.

The only small thing we all mentioned. The rooms are decorated in dark colours and the lighting for hair and makeup really isn't great. There are mirrors but please please  ask a woman when you design your rooms :-)

This hotel is so central for Belfast with the opera house adjacent and some lovely restaurants close by.
A definite if your thinking of going to Belfast.",5,2015,05,26
226,5 stars all round,Recently  stayed at the Fitzwilliam  hotel .Yet again faultless  my wife loves the city of belfast & we visit  regularly  we always stay at the Fitzwilliam. Everything  about this hotel is brilliant  from the location  to the rooms to the staff .As it may be a slightly  bit more expensive  than other hotels the the service is second  to none .Staff couldn't  be more helpful  nothing  is a problem  .The only advice  id give to people  is make sure you book a room with this hotel you wont be disappointed we wouldn‚Äôt  stay anywhere  else.Cant wait for our next visit  at start of the year,5,2015,05,26
226,Unbelievable food & professional service,"Excellent location, food is amazing and i was suprized how affordable it was too! 
If you want a stay where you will be made to feel inportant, this is the place.

Not many places i would give 5 star but its worth it.. the pork i had could be compared to a finely cooked steak",5,2015,05,26
226,Fab Hotel ,"Just on the way back from a 2 night stay with my hubbie, perfect location, lovely staff especially the receptionists that checked us in and out, breakfast was amazing and the room was to die for (you could fit 10 people in the shower, not that we tried it!) would defo return",5,2015,05,26
226,Fab!,First time in the fitzwilliam and certainly won't b the last. Check in was great staff very friendly. Room was lovely nice wee sofa in it which is nice to have somewhere else to sit. Bed was so comfy best nights sleep ive ever had in a hotel. Didn't eat in the hotel so can't comment but we did have a few drinks bar staff very good and the cocktails are beaut. If I had any thing to complain about and it's very small but our TV didn't work right it had very bad signal and didn't work well but that was all nothing serious. Roll on next visit. üòÑ,5,2015,05,25
226,Fleeting visit being judged upon checkin and breakfast,"My sister was getting married in City Hall and staying in the Fitzwiliam along with the bridal party and some guests on Friday 22nd May 2015. I had high expectations of this 5* hotel. We checked in and 3 rooms together and from the moment we came in through the front door reception staff were seeking our attention and very welcoming but the information they gave to each of us varied quite significantly. I was told about the mini bar and how it was sensor activated so unless you really wanted drink from you, the advice wasn't to near it because movement was going to be charged. I didn't hear anything about breakfast, wifi or which floor my room was on. I work in a hotel so I surmised that room 319 was on the 3rd floor. My brother checked in and he got the information about wifi without asking and a further brother was told about breakfast etc. It was lucky we were all together and could share this information.
Then we went to a wedding in City Hall and a reception elsewhere so our next experience was breakfast. I had a hangover but my husband who always enjoys breakfast was a trusting voice of opinion as well. We went down and were met straight away, led to a table and explained the process. I loved the continental spread and visited twice to the table for fruit, yoghurt, pastries, cheese & meats. I didn't opt for a hot breakfast but was pleased to see that the hot breakfast was an order rather than buffet, but it appears the buffet was simply at the other side of the kitchen doors because a full breakfast arrived within 30 seconds, cold, dried up and stale. The tea must have came from a geezer because it was cold, toast wasn't offered but when asked for took some time about coming. No plates were removed after eating ut instead left until we vacated the table. That is not up to NITB standards. 
Rooms were very well equipped with music, plenty of room, tea & coffee making facilities and a spacious bathroom although the toilet roll was cheap and not cheerful.",3,2015,05,24
226,Wow.  Wow.  Wow.,"What a beautiful hotel! The staff are amazing.  They will come out and park your car for you.  They will bring your bags to your room.  They will give you advice on restaurants etc

The lobby is amazing with fake fire etc.  Decor  modern but welcoming.  Very nice toiletries in the bedroom.  And a very comfortable bed.  The bathroom had both a bath and shower.  The only issue we had was a problem to access the wifi otherwise would definitely recommend as there is a touch of luxury to this hotel.",5,2015,05,24
226,Good average city centre hotel,"Firstly you have to find it.  It has very small signage and the actual entrance is round the corner from the main street.  It is very disconcerting to have to pull up in a small bay with double yellow lines on it,also to have two parking wardens eying you.  Concierge took over and all was well.  Do book your valet parking before you go.  Bedrooms are comfortable.  Location is very central. Attitude in the hotel is on the basis of you need to ask to get anything done.  Bar was very quiet as was the restaurant.  Would recommend that there is much better food to be had elsewhere.  Ask the concierge! Breakfast was average, but again service was very hit and miss. Despite our protestations we were still charged for items that we insisted we had pre paid for.  So left with a sour taste in the mouth.",4,2015,05,24
226,"Style, grace, warmth and comfort","Starting from the moment the concierge meets you at the curb, the experience at the Fitzwilliam is first rate.  During our three night stay, each concierge, (Gerard, Phillip and Dermot) went out of his way to help us find the best restaurants, make travel arrangements and assure that our time in Belfast was interesting and stress free.  The accomodations at the Fitzwilliam are spacious and spotlessly clean.  The reasonable cost of the rooms make this one of the best values in Belfast.",5,2015,05,21
226,Can't quite give it five,"It is the decor that means I can't give this hotel a score of five. It really is not restful to have bedrooms with dark brown (almost black) and a sort of yellow/green upholstery. The carpet has a dark brown and white (? Not enough light to check) geometric maze pattern. The lobby is 60's style, and the 1st floor breakfast room has stalls which are uncomfortable for more that two or tables for eight (I was in a group of four).

Having got that off my chest I can now say it is otherwise a hotel of a very high standard. Good sized, quiet room at a reasonable rate. I didn't try the restaurant for dinner as I has taken out to several superb restaurants nearby. The staff were very pleasant and helpful. It is quite convenient for the bus station where the bus from the International airport comes in. A comfortable lobby lounge.",4,2015,05,21
226,Luxurious hotel in good location,"Friendly staff and comfortable rooms make this a good choice for a Belfast hotel. 
The bedrooms were a very good size, with a lovely large bed.
We were using some of the business rooms and facilities and were very well looked after. I would return.",4,2015,05,20
226,Great Hotel & Location,Stayed here for one night in an Executive room and was very impressed with everything about this hotel from we arrived. Its a really modern / contemporary hotel in a perfect location in Belfast. Room was very spacious and breakfast was delicious. Only small point was that the residents bar must not stay open very late but not a big deal. Would definitely recommend and can't wait until I've an excuse to go back.,5,2015,05,20
226,Lovely rooms but they hide the tea & coffee,"We got to spend a night in this hotel as the Jury's Inn across the road was over booked.

The room was stunning as was the bathroom.  Lovely feel to the place, thought the corridors are a bit on the dark side.  

My only complaint was I could not see any tea / coffee making facilities in the room nor any bottles of water.  When I was packing up in the morning I saw what I thought was just a mirror beside the bed, but it had a handle - lo and behold tea/coffee/mini bar and free bottles of water!  Would have been nice if these were put out on a table rather then hidden away.

Other then that I would come back again to stay even just to see what the food is like.

Oh, one final thing - soft mattress!  If you are like me and like to sleep on a hard bed, this is not for you.  I did wake up stiff in the morning time, but it would not stop me from returning.",4,2015,05,20
226,"Oasis in central Belfast, close to some of the best restaurants","Very convenient for excellent restaurants in Belfast, friendly and responsive staff.  Great breakfast, hot items on request means no typical display of hot items.  Very comfortable rooms and amenities, an excellent quality radio on hand!",4,2015,05,19
226,Fabulous Fitz,Loved every second on our return visit to the Fitzwilliam hotel üòÉ the Fitzwilliam is in our home town & we stay here several times a year & each & everytime is a treat...can't wait to return again in December this year.,5,2015,05,19
226,Wonderful night stay and excellent location,"Stayed in this hotel for one night It was brilliant Had a beautiful room on the 7th Floor The  concierge Gerard and Dermot were extremely helpful nothing was any problem for them from parking the car ,booking a restaurant,booking Titanic tickets City Bus tour tickets and taxis they were more than happy to oblige. Excellent location right in the center of Belfast. We had lunch in the bar which was excellent and the breakfast was very good. All staff very helpful and friendly. Would definitely stay here again and would recommend to any one visiting Belfast.",5,2015,05,18
226,A little disappointing,"Perhaps it's just me - but I'd expected so much more for the price we were paying. With the exception of the lobby area, I found the hotel very dark and depressing, the corridors to the rooms seemed particularly badly lit and the lighting in our room was subdued to say the least! The room we were given appeared to be a disabled room - not sure why as we are both able bodied - the sink was far too low for us. When I went to use the shower the water wasn't hot enough and the pressure far too much - it was so powerful the shower head was being pushed off! Disappointing quantity of toiletries as well, barely enough shower gel and shampoo for 2 people - but they did smell pleasant. 
Despite all my moans the positives outweighed the negatives - the staff were wonderful - nothing was too much trouble, the hotel was spotlessly clean and we had a delicious breakfast. The valet parking is very good if a little expensive, the location is perfect, within walking distance of many of Belfast's main attractions. ",4,2015,05,17
226,Very good indeed!,"After a pretty poor start to our weekend break in alternative accommodation we headed to the Fitzwilliam.
Having just completed six weeks away with work staying in numerous hotels this one really stood out! 

When booking we asked if we might be able to check in early as we wanted to hot foot it out of previous nights accommodation asap and get ready for a wedding. The girls on reception went way over and above to ensure that this was made possible which was seriously appreciated. The room was absolutely beautiful, cafeti√®re with fresh coffee, candles around the bath and overall beautiful decor. 

Brekkie was fantastic too, this place really is something else!",5,2015,05,16
226,Cocktails masterclass,"Was at the fitzwilliam for a cocktail masterclass with Ciaran. A lovely friendly person who knew all about the cocktails we were making. He was helpful, happy, fun and very professional. It was well worth the money and a perfect start to a night out in Belfast. Thank you Ciaran and the Fitzwilliam Hotel.",5,2015,05,16
226,Great hotel,"Having stayed in Belfast for many years it was really good to see something better than the Europa come to town.  This hotel is well appointed,  stylish not flashy. Friendly staff and concierge. 
Rooms are large, modern and contemporary design.",5,2015,05,12
226,amazing,Lovely hotel  and the staff cant do enough. Good location which is  in the middle of belfast. we have stayed in the Dublin one as well and both hotels offers luxury accommodation. The breakfast is also fab here.,5,2015,05,12
226,perfect,"love this hotel and have stayed here many times.  I should've wrote this review ages ago but one thing an another.....so my lovely dinner in the restaurant has spurred me into action.

Clean and well arranged rooms with a sofa by the window, plenty of space and somewhere to hang your coat when you come in.  The bathroom is immaculate with a separate shower and bath.  The food is excellent and good value if you go for the set menu and the staff are really hospitable and friendly.  the central location means I don't need to mess about with taxis.  A definite asset for Belfast and a welcomed bolthole whilst I'm here for work.",5,2015,05,11
226,It's the people that make any hotel. And the people here make it really nice,"I stayed here over a long weekend, my wife stayed every week for several months a year for work. It's beautifully decorated with great breakfasts in a well-designed restaurant. The rooms are generously sized and the location is great. But the best recommendation is the people who work here: warm, good humoured, nothing is too much trouble. Some 'high design' boutique hotels actually fall down on service and basic competencies. As I get older, I get less tolerant of that stuff. (I used to live at the Royalton in New York, wouldn't be seen dead in it now).

The Fitzwilliam gets it so right. Belfast teaching New York how to be cool, who'd have thought?",4,2015,05,11
226,Enjoyed 2 nights,"A really lovely stay at the Fitzwilliam and so far my favourite in Belfast. Robes in our room were good and slippers tucked away in a draw (which a previous reviewer stated were not provided). Breakfast was plentiful and service efficient and friendly this weekend. Sadly, I missed the 9.30pm end time for some bar food as I arrived late on Friday and was also told that they didn't stock nuts; unusual I thought for such a lovely hotel bar. I would definitely stay at the Fitzwilliam in the future.",4,2015,05,10
226,Another excellent stay in The Fitzwilliam Hotel,"Third time staying in the Fitzwilliam just as impressive as the first time. Superior room with corner window was very impressive and very clean. Bed was extremely comfortable. Booked a package that included evening meal in the restaurant, bed & breakfast. The meal in the restaurant was amazing, very tasty, mouth watering food with excellent service. Special mention to our waiter Timothy! Had a few drinks in the bar in the evening which had a great atmosphere and very nice cocktails. Breakfast was again excellent very high quality, well cooked food and relaxed service. Overall excellent, friendly customer service from every member of staff made another enjoyable stay. I will be back!",5,2015,05,10
226,Great Experience!!,"If you're looking for a great experience at a hotel, this is the place, rooms are fantastic, service is great, the bar and restaurant is amazing, all the fine details have been well thought out and service is the priority.

However if you simply want a place to sleep and shower in the morning, whilst exploring Belfast, then there are much cheaper options nearby.",4,2015,05,10
226,Great Hotel,"Good food, friendly and helpful staff, very comfy beds, large walk in shower, instead of the usual over the barh and location couldn't be better ( next door to Opera House ), but I think it is a little expensive for what you get when you compare it to the Europa 100 yards away, and definitely does not have the same atmosphere. Dressing gowns a little bit tatty, no slippers, you would expect them at that price and bill had to be amended, charged for food that was included in the package! Sister in law, our guest from Canada and her husband, said she had the best nights sleep ever, loved the bed!!!!",4,2015,05,10
226,Excellent stay,Our first ever visit to Belfast and this hotel did not disappoint. Excellent room overlooking Belfast good size en-suite with quality toiletries. We ate in the restaurant and enjoyed the offer of a 4 course dinner for 2 and bottle wine for ¬£55. The reception staff were very friendly and helpful. The hotel's central location is ideal for getting out sight-seeing and enjoy the night-life. We enjoyed our stay in this hotel and loved Belfast.,5,2015,05,10
226,Great Hotel in a fantastic city,"I've stayed at the Fitzwilliam many times on business. The hotel has very comfortable rooms and the staff are always professional, nothing is too much trouble, they are exceptionally good.

Breakfast is between 7-10.30am, not the quickest of services if you want a hot breakfast, a 6.30am start would better suit my working hours. The restaurant has an evening menu, which hasn't exceeded expectation. There are plenty of independent restaurants in Belfast that are a must, and many are a short walk from the hotel, James St South bar and grill is a favourite of mine.",5,2015,05,09
226,Nice hotel but a bit pricey for what you get,"The hotel is functional, well located and has all the amenities, but a bit too expensive for what you actually get. The rooms aren't huge, but nothing atypical for a centrally located hotel. 

The location is great - walking distance from the city center and next to a lot  of bars and restaurants.  The concierge is extremely helpful and have great recommendations for things to do. ",4,2015,05,05
226,"Great hotel, perfect location!","Great hotel and perfectly located with just a short walk to some great Belfast spots.
Very nice rooms, comfy beds, good shower.
The bar area was great, served some nice food, good cocktails and very reasonably priced.
The staff were extremely helpful and very friendly, as long as you are hotel customer.
And here comes the BUT... we wanted to bring couple of our friends to the hotel for a drink at the bar, and they were not allowed in! Since it was pretty late at night one of the girls asked concierge for a cab and was told there were none, when I walked up to order one, it came within 15 mins...",4,2015,05,05
226,Wish we could have stayed longer,"Hotel was beautiful. Front desk and doormen really friendly and efficient. Room very nice and clean. Only able to stay one night, would have liked to stay more.  Concierge was helpful.  Would definitely go back again and love to see more of this city.",4,2015,05,05
226,Mini Break,"Stayed here on a saturday night.   Room was lovely, cosy, bed very comfortable...everything you'd expect from a hotel of this standard.  We had dinner which was very tasty, plenty of choice on menu .....I opted for the baked haddock, it was very tasty but the portion was very small....there were no accompanying vegetables or side dishes which made the main meal look even more paltry.....  The breakfast had a great choice on menu and was excellent.  Overall the staff were efficient, professional and friendly.",4,2015,05,04
226,"Good hotel, average restaurant","Room 601 had a great view of the street, while no noise was disturbing our sleep. Room was small but high quality. The restaurant was a bit lame, good service, but average food. There are no windows in the restaurant, so it feels a bit like in a cave. Continental breakfast was included in the room rate, but hadn't a lot to offer.",4,2015,05,04
226,Comic-Con Weekend!,"My best friend and I stayed here this weekend; for my birthday, as well as for the local Comic-Con convention in the King's Hall.

We really loved our stay - the reception staff were so friendly and professional, we ordered dinner and breakfast room service; and both were fantastic! (The bar staff were also great - highly recommend the strawberry daiquiris!)

The room itself? Absolutely beautiful. We slept so well, loved our baths and showers. Generally chilling out for the night was great, we were very comfortable.

Overall; a brilliant stay, and we will be back! We did get a few stares due to our outfits for the event, which was totally expected and accepted! Otherwise, the staff chatted away to us, wished me a happy birthday, offered to order a taxi... you were all fab.

Many thanks!
",5,2015,05,03
226,great stay,"everything was A+
helpful staff,
nice big room and spotless,
bar prices reasonable for a city hotel.
great that you can get parked in the grounds of the hotel ¬£17.00 a night
lounge area nice and airy.
would stay again",5,2015,05,03
226,Nice hotel in a good location,"Stayed for two nights in January on a trip to Belfast to see titanic museum and some other things. This is a really solid choice if you want a nice hotel in the city, it is walking distance to everything in the city and there are lots of good places to eat nearby. The staff in the hotel are very good and helpful in every respect. The concierge desk organised a taxi tour for us which was really good. Would not hesitate to stay here again.",4,2015,05,02
226,Perfectly located to explore Belfast's delights,Fantastic location. Next door to opera house and within walking distance of all major attractions. Particularly helpful concierge desk that really helped us make the most out of our very short visit. Great restaurants nearby. Particularly good breakfast offering in a very nicely designed contemporary fining room. Bar is lively and is clearly popular locally so does not suffer the normal fate of dreary hotel bars. Our room was comfortable and very well equipped. Only gripe was the bathroom. Very dark ( but that's a personal taste thing) and very poor water pressure on a very large shower head( again a bit of a personal bug bear). Overall a really good experience and would recommend.,4,2015,04,30
226,Christmas Getaway,My wife and I spent 3 nights at the Fitzwilliam just before Christmas in a deluxe room.  The lobby and bar on the first floor were great places to hang out when the weather was not cooperating outside.  The room felt very spacious with the floor-to-ceiling windows and was clean and comfortable.  The service in the restaurant was a little inattentive but the food was good.  In general the staff were very nice but would not always follow through on general requests (such as replacing toilet paper in the bathroom) and sometimes we had to make multiple requests for service.  I think the service issue is more a question of the overall service industry in Ireland vs. USA with a more relaxed approach in Ireland to attentive service; as we experienced this throughout Belfast during our stay.  The location is excellent and within easy walking distance to many major attractions in the city. Overall we very much enjoyed our stay at the hotel and would return again in the future.,4,2015,04,27
226,Great service in city centre,"First stop in Ireland and great way to start our trip. The front desk staff were incredibly friendly and helpful - good advice on restaurants and travelling directions. The room was well laid out, fairly spacious with a large bathroom. The tub was inviting but we didn't have time for it. The bed was VERY comfortable. The location was perfect - we walked through downtown and to the Titanic museum and we were a short ride to the mural tour. The breakfast was a little pricey for what we got but it's easy to find a different spot near by.",5,2015,04,27
226,Disappointing,"As it is classed as a 5* hotel, I was expecting a little better. Was attending a concert in Belfast and would have liked a comfortable stay. Arriving and checking in was fine, the receptionist who checked me & my partner in was lovely and very helpful. When going to the room we noticed the hotel is very dark and hallways are quite narrow. When we arrived to the room it was clean and had al the necessities you expect from a hotel. However we noticed our double bed was actually just two singles pushed together. We were very disappointed! The beds aren't all that comfy and as we were paying for a double room and the price of a 5* hotel room we definitely expected better. The lounge are we attended for a drink, we were given a cocktail menu and were told they made upto 80 different cocktails but were not given on the menu, however when we asked for any we were told they couldn't make it. Definitely expected better. ",3,2015,04,22
226,Perfect,"We had a dinner, bread and breakfast bought for us as a gift chill out evening just after our wedding. It was amazing, we couldn't fault a thing.

The bedroom was beautiful with a great view and super comfy.

Both our meals were delicious, we ate every bite despite not thinking we were that hungry.

Breakfast was amazing, possibly the best eggs benedict I'd ever had.

Otherwise the staff were very friendly and efficient, check in and out was very easy and quick.",5,2015,04,20
226,Nice Hotel with a great location,"We really enjoyed our stay at the Fitzpatrick, which was recommended to us by our friend that live in Belfast.  We found a great rate and were pleased with the comfort of the room.  The overall service was good and the food in the restaurant was nice as well.  One of the features of the hotel is a great lobby with a fireplace and comfortable chairs.  We sat and relaxed with drinks on one occasion and tea on another.",4,2015,04,18
226,Plush,"I havent stayed in the rooms here, so cant comment. However, I popped in here on business for a drink recently and I have to say I was impressed by the plush surroundings and the very attentive staff. The staff were extremely customer focused and professional. However, the pint I purchased is over priced at ¬£4.80. One of the most expensive pints I have had in Belfast. I guess youre paying for the lovely surroundings and well customer friendly staff!",4,2015,04,17
226,Best Hotel in Belfast,"I stayed at this hotel in January for my girlfriends birthday and for my birthday in April both times it was amazing. We had dinner in the restaurant and cocktails at the bar. The food was very good and there is a great choice of cocktails in the bar. The best thing about this hotel is the customer service, nothing is too much for the staff. An example of this was when we stayed in January and the Chef upgraded my steak because it was not a good enough cut to send out (brilliant). Also a special mention to Joey who checked us in both times and was great and also to Anna who was looking after us in April when we stayed and again nothing was a problem for her and she even managed to make us laugh.",5,2015,04,17
226,"An average hotel now, that may once have been great..","Having booked a show in Belfast, we were looking for a hotel that was located in the city centre that was close to the theatre in question. As it happened it was right next door!

On arrival, the first thing that struck me was the apparent lack of parking, and the difficulty stopping outside the hotel -  there are only two set down spots, which on this occasion were both full. As it's a busy street we had to drive around the block a couple of times until it was free and unload our luggage. It quickly became obvious there was nowhere to park expect the private car park accross as the road, whose owners clearly take advantage of that situation by charging a hefty ¬£17 per night.

Check in was fast and efficent and we were met by one of the nicest receptionists I've every met. Pleasent and helpful.

We were staying on the 4th floor and the first thing that struck me was the missing handrail in the list. It was only obvious because of the poor repair job to fill the gaps!

The hallways are quite dark, and our room wasn't exactly large. As I do in every hotel I headed straight to the window, where I was more than disappointed by the view which consisted of looking into other peoples rooms, and down into a service yard. Overall the room was clean, aside from the half empty bottle of water which was left on the table from a previous occupant.

There was the usual equipment, hairdryer, kettle, ironing board etc. A minibar was also present, although you'll be in for a shock at the prices.

The bathroom was fantastic, and the shower a dream. Perfectly clean and quite big.

We didn't eat in the hotel so I cannot speak for the food, but the bar area was large and enjoyable and the staff very helpful.

Checkout again was fast and easy.

Overall this is a nice hotel, quite comfortable and well located. However it reeks of a business trying to reduce their costs by cutting corners and lowering quality levels. I expected more from the Fitzwilliam brand.",3,2015,04,15
226,Not so good,"We checked into the Fitzwilliam from a 5 star hotel...  There was quite a big difference.   The hotel is quite dark and really not all that clean feeling.  Our reservation for 2 beds was not communicated so we had to stay in the accessble room; the next day we overheard them do the same to another guest...  Also our Mother was repeatedly interrupted by maids even though her Do Not Disturb sign was up.  There was also mistakes made on our check out date and the staff almost booted her from the room.  She is elderly and speaks little english, plus she was sick that day...  can't believe they almost kicked her out.  Emailed management about the problems and was told they would address the issues, so hopefully if you stay here it will be a better experience.",2,2015,04,15
226,Amazing,"Being in a city centre there is limited parking so we chose valet parking from the hotel
This was worth every penny
The concierges were helpful friendly and super informative about the city and where to go 
The reception staff were amazing and friendly throughout our stay
The restaurant staff really did exceed my expectations, I'm coeliac so struggle sometimes when we eat out but the staff made it so easy and didn't flinch at any of my questions making me feel normal throughout my stay
The bar staff made wonderful cocktails and the service for both food and drink exceptional
The maids were great and our room looked like new every day

Finally I was most impressed at the lack of obvious management team. I could tell who they were by name badges alone they seem to fit as an amazing team.
We loved the hotel it made our holiday perfect
Thank you ",5,2015,04,13
226,One night stay,stayed here 10th april for one night while attending an event in the odyssey. On arrival check in was quick and friendly staff gave us all the information we required. Room was nice and clean however i do agree with previous reviews about the darkness. corridors very dark colours as well as parts of room. bathroom was large and clean with a good size mirror. Only negative i would have is that the only mirror beside a plug to do your hair is covered by the tv unless you stand to do this(minor i know). Didnt take breakfast as I thought it was very overpriced ¬£16.50pp when you could go to cafe or shop and get a nice ulster fry for less than ¬£5 each. Overall had a good nights sleep with very quiet room,4,2015,04,13
226,Excellent hotel,"Stayed here for 2 nights on business, and everything about the hotel was ideal. Staff were very helpful, room was excellent with a sofa and White Company toiletries. Taxis were arranged and never took more than a couple of minutes to arrive. The taxi tour they arranged of the peace walls and murals was especially good. Breakfast was the typically overpriced hotel selection, but quality was good. Stereo and good quality coffee in the room was another bonus. Would stay here again.
",5,2015,04,11
226,Pleasant city centre hotel,The Fitzwilliam is a pleasant city centre hotel. However I only really enjoy it if I can get a seat on the cosy sofas in the foyer beside the fire. I've only eaten in it twice and the food was nice each time. They have a good wine selection. Unfortunately I think the place seems to lack a bit of character or atmosphere.,3,2015,04,09
226,Xmas break,A late review but we had an outstanding stay here :) the staff were amazing and couldnt fault anything. the rooms were very modern and the bar men and women were very professional and outgoing with great humour.. they are a credit to the hotel ,5,2015,04,08
226,Lovely!,"Stayed here for 2 nights at Easter, it was perfect! Really lovely staff and one of the most comfortable hotel beds I've ever slept in! The location is excellent with some really good bars and restaurants within easy walking distance. Will definitely be back üòÑ ",5,2015,04,07
226,Excellent Hotel!,"I have just spent 2 nights at the Fitzwilliam Hotel Belfast. I am really fussy when it comes to hotels and would be the first to complain if needed, on this occasion I was blown away, the location, staff, decor, food, cleanliness was superb nothing was too much trouble. I would highly recommend staying here.",5,2015,04,06
226,"Very good, short of great","The best thing about the Fitzwilliam may be that it obviously considers itself, and strives to be, an absolutely first-class hotel. The location is central but surprisingly quiet; the staff is excellent; the rooms are clean and comfortable; the (included) breakfast offers a range of cold and made-to-order hot foods. Even the price is right - or was for us, when we arrived without a reservation and made arrangements at reception. All that said, it's not quite in a class with our previous stop, the Merrion in Dublin. The physical limitations of the facility itself - a narrow site with all rooms on the street side, too-dark decor, and weird electric system - no doubt challenge the best efforts of the staff.",4,2015,04,06
226,Best hotel in Belfast,"This hotel is just up in my top 5 best hotels to stay.  I loved the location, the d√©cor, the staff and the food.  The staff are some of the best I have encountered in hotels and nothing is too much trouble.  As a returning guest there was a welcome note in my room and chocolates.  The kitchen staff are so accommodating if you require something not on the menu (where possible of course).",5,2015,04,05
226,"Great Hotel, Amazing Staff!","The hotel is clean, modern, and well maintained. The staff goes above and beyond to make sure your stay is enjoyable. From the front desk staff to the concierge to the staff in the restaurant and bar, everyone was engaging, helpful and professional. I highly recommend this hotel if your travel plans include a stay in Belfast.",5,2015,04,02
226,Wish I stayed longer!,"My husband bought an overnight stay here for my birthday.  We only stayed one night but I could easily spend a week here.     The staff are fabulous throughout. The friendly bar staff make easily the best strawberry daquaris in Belfast!

 We arrived in Belfast early and rang ahead to see if we could reserve a car parking space.  The receptionist not only sorted this out but also made a room available so we could check - in early as well.
 
The interior of the room was beautiful and so elegant. 

The food in the restaurant was great and couldn't find any fault either during our evening meal or the next morning at breakfast.

Would I return here...? A definatate YES",5,2015,04,01
226,Birthday treat,"Stayed one night only in a Junior Suite.  This was a birthday treat for my partner.  Lovely touch of a plate with a few chocolates on it and a card with birthday wishes on it on arrival in the room.  No complaints about the room at all.  Very comfortable and everything you could wish for.  However, my praise goes to the staff.  Having stayed in the Fitzwilliam previously, we always found the staff a tad abrupt.  Such a pleasant change this time.  Everyone from check in to breakfast was lovely and extremely helpful.  By the way - breakfast was wonderful.  Will definitely be back.",5,2015,03,31
226,Exceptional ,"Stayed here for 3 nights. We were upgraded to an executive suite, and can only say WOW !!
The staff were amazing, nothing was too much trouble. Thankyou to all the reception staff, the bar staff and the concierge guys, all made our stay memorable.",5,2015,03,31
226,Great hotel in Belfast,"We stayed 3 nights at the Fitzwilliam Hotel in Belfast in late March. We were very pleased with everything. Our room was large, clean and very comfortable. The couch was great to sit on while watching TV; there was a nice desk and chair; the room had a lot of good lighting; the wardrobe had drawers and lots of hanging space was available; we appreciated the safe; the bed was a super king size. The bathroom was impressive. Overall , the decor was very nice - quite sophisticated but not cold.
The lobby was very nice with  good , comfortable seating areas; the gas fireplace a nice touch.
Floral displays were fabulous. 
Service was excellent - a request was attended promptly; the concierge gave us great advice and was able to make reservations for us as needed. 
The bar area was nice and the food was good.
We enjoyed our stay very much. We would stay there again.",5,2015,03,29
226,Excellent,"This was our 4th stay in the hotel and on this occasion our visit was to celebrate a 40th birthday.   Our room which was on the 8th floor was very modern and had the usual complimentary toiletries.  The staff had taken time to leave us some buns and a card to mark the occasion which was unexpected and a nice touch.  

There was a problem with the air conditioning which was blasting out only hot air.  We mentioned this to the concierge in the lobby who promptly came to inspect the unit.  Unfortunately it was found to be broken.  The duty manager was very apologetic for the inconvenience and provided us with free standing fans to cool the room down.  We were also given a partial refund on the cost of the room. 

On check out a member of staff apologised again for the issue we had had with the air conditioning and enquired as to whether despite this the room had been comfortable enough.        

All in all an excellent stay.  The staff are warm and friendly who will go out of their way to help guests and are a credit to the hotel.",5,2015,03,28
226,A Total Nighmare.,"Arrived at Reception,got our room on 7th floor,door was open,workman repairing pipes,back to reception,explained the situation,asked us,are you sure you went to proper room,is this a joke,of course we did. The young lady entered a room,came back ten minutes later,i am putting you into a room on 3rd floor we are fully booked,We replied no you are not,we requested a room on a high floor,she then got rude,we do not have another room. We said this is horrendous,a five star hotel,sent us to a room which was under repair,get me a manager.In ten seconds a manageress appeared,Told us this was far below the standard of the Fitzwilliam Hotel,give us a lovely corner room on 6th floor,the noise of traffic kept us awake for two nights.Had dinner on first night in hotel,We ordered,the waiter said,you will not kiss your wife tonight,i replied why would that be,because of the garlic potatoes,he replied,we were in shock,five star hotel.Now it gets really bad.Ordered confit of duck leg,out comes two thick portions of duck breast,which was tough,not pleasent at all.Mentioned this to same waiter this is not what i ordered,sorry sir i forgot to mention that the confit of duck was finished,i then said,you should have told me that when i ordered,i know sir but i forgot.Five Star Hotel.I could go on with more faults but decide not to.Special Anniversary,ruined,was glad to leave,so many bad memories,instead of good ones.Hang your heads in shame Fitzwilliam,will never be back.This is totally true.",3,2015,03,27
226,Excellent All Round,"So so impressed by the helpful and friendly staff.  Nothing was too much trouble for them but you never felt that they were being over the top and in your face.  Whoever recruited and trained then should be congratulated.  If I open a shop in Belfast I might come and poach your staff!!
Lovely rooms and a good size too with very generous sized bathrooms too.  Will definitely stay here again when next in Belfast.",5,2015,03,27
226,very stylish but overpriced brekky,"Stayed here one night for business, very stylish & comfortable indeed and my room was lovely & bright but boy did I need earplugs - I had a stunning corner room but it was right above a major traffic junction. Ask for a back of hotel room or bring your own earplugs if you don't like constant heavy traffic noise! The one complaint I do have is the outrageous cost of breakfast. ¬£16 for an omelette & a coffee? Really? Even though I wasn't paying I was horrified!",4,2015,03,27
226,The staff make all the difference,"What a lovely hotel, in a great location. The outstanding piece of the puzzle was the staff. We arrived by car (you pay extra for carpark) but were met by the concierge who unpacked our luggage and parked the car. The receptionists were so lovely and very helpful. The next day we were asked what our plans were and not only did they book the bus tour but they arranged with the tour guide to pick us up at the hotel!! Couldn't be happier!! ",5,2015,03,26
226,Absolutely fantastic!,"Myself an my mother spent 1 night here as a Mother's Day treat. Wow we really weren't disappointed. The staff at reception were very warm and welcoming. The room is beautiful, very spacious with a very comfortable king size bed. We had afternoon tea for 2 in the bar. It was delicious more than enough sandwiches and delicious scones and cakes for 2. We couldn't finish so the friendly waiter offered to bag up the remaining scones and cakes for us. We were attending a show in the grand opera house which is right next to the hotel. A perfect location. Breakfast was delicious, the staff were lovely and couldn't do enough to help. It was such a wonderful stay. A fabulous hotel made extra special by the amazing staff in particular Melanie who made us feel so welcome and like she knew us years. I will definitely returns to this fantastic hotel in the future.",5,2015,03,26
226,Not much to complain about,"Not exactly 'Boutique' but so what. Delightful and helpful staff, a breakfast that sets you up for the day (even if the booth seats are not quite large enough for four and the designer chairs are not the most comfortable) made it a perfect place for a working weekend.
Talking about design the rooms follow the current trend where 'black' is king - which is fine provided the lighting has been thought through. Sadly the area just inside the door to the room where you place your luggage and where the light switches are (also black) is somewhat underlit meaning a fair amount of fumbling is required to locate the controls. A light within the cupboard would be handy too. But I'm quibbling, the bed was comfortable, a good range of pillows, all in all they have it right. Furthermore it's right next door to the Opera House if that's your bag - it was mine and at great prices.",4,2015,03,25
226,a gem in Belfast,"We stayed here for a night and wished we could have stayed longer. Groovy hotel ..rooms are in funky colours..bathroom so cool..black n white tiles. Comp water and teas..plunger coffer..hot chocolate. Beds so comfy. Staff were so helpful.Girls on reception lovely. Dermot the concierge was so helpful ..nothing was a problem. Located just around corner from train station..close to bars and restaurants.
Visit the Crown across the road.",5,2015,03,24
226,"Great staff, disappointing room","Temperature was too hot in room, this could not be adjusted, wifi was not working, There was only two channels showing on the TV, both of them were news channels, US and French. The booking confirmation indicated there will be an iPod dock in the room, turns out there wasnt and when I called down to reception the front desk said the hotel is under going a refurbishment and therefore all of the iPod docks have been removed from every room which didn't make sense and was still indicated on the website. Staff then decided to move us to a superior room which was very nice of them and had  gave us free music channels to make up for no iPod dock, but the temperature of the room was like an oven. Just to make the stay even worse than it was, I was ironing my white shirt and because the iron was burnt by a previous guest it ruined my shirt right before I checked out. I won't be staying here again.",3,2015,03,24
226,Amazing one night's stay...,"We were very excited about staying at The Fitzwilliam Hotel and it didn't disappoint! Very stylish and modern interiors. The lobby was very nice, really cosy. Check in was nice and quick!

Our room was excellent! Very clean. Loved the colour choice of green and black for the decor. Lamps hanging from the ceiling instead of taking up floor space were very funky! Lovely, comfortable armchair in the corner beside the windows - great for sitting with a cup of tea and watching the world go by down below on the street. The king bed was incredibly comfy, both of us had a decent nights sleep. 

Bathroom was fabulous! Beautiful walk in shower with a waterfall head (amazing!). The design of the waterfall head means there isn't an enormous amount of water pressure, so the option of a little hose or something would have been good - the bath did have one though. The bathtub itself was quite deep and absolutely perfect for relaxing in at the end of the day. Plenty of towels and great little toiletries too including a candle and a box of matches for a bit of romance! Nice little touch. 

Good choice of tea/coffee/hot chocolate in the room, along with shortbread biscuits! And complimentary bottles of water which was brilliant. Loved that there was an umbrella in the room that could be used during our stay - definitely comes in handy! And the hi-fi was great too. Only one dressing gown and pair of slippers though even though there's two people in the room. Not a big deal, we could easily have asked for one if needed but it just makes sense to have one for each guest? 

The mini bar was fully stocked, not that we took anything from it anyway BUT we did shift some stuff around to make room for a couple bottles of water we brought ourselves. We didn't realise that when something is removed, you get charged for it after 30 seconds (there's some sort of sensor in it) so that was a shock at check out the next day when we got a ¬£40 bill, but thankfully the lovely lady at reception understood and didn't charge us, phew!! 

We had breakfast in the room and it was amazing! Good choice on the breakfast menu, including specialities like pancakes and maple syrup (delicious!). The fry was excellent - you could pick exactly what you wanted rather than it being a regular fry up. Nice big pot of tea and fresh orange juice‚Ä¶ a decent breakfast and a good start to the day!

Hotel was very quiet during the afternoon, it was only late at night when there seemed to be a lot of noise. The person in the room next to us was making a terrible racket slamming cupboard doors and such. The doors to the rooms are quite heavy and kind of loud whenever closed (especially if just allowed to slam shut) but thankfully everyone seemed to settle down after a while. Not much noise from the street, but then we were on the 7th floor of the hotel so that makes a difference.

All the staff were lovely and very helpful! One young woman rang to check some details about the breakfast menu for us which was greatly appreciated! And even though she wasn't assisting us upon check out, she asked if we enjoyed our breakfast (particularly the pancakes!)‚Ä¶ Just really lovely and attentive. She also said cheerio when we went back to collect our bags. A nice person. I think her name was Joey?

Location of the hotel is perfect. Right beside the Grand Opera House so perfect if you are seeing a show. A short walking distance right into the heart of the city and on the same street as the bus/train station so handy for travelling too! 

Really impressed with this hotel and we will certainly be back!",5,2015,03,23
226,"Lovely rooms, great bar","Beds in the rooms are absolutely huge and really comfy.  Great facilities and the shower was nice and powerful.

I tried the bar out after my meetings in town and the selection of whiskey was great with really helpful bar staff who knew their stuff and were able to make some good recommendations.

I would definitely go back there if staying in Belfast for pleasure too.",5,2015,03,22
226,Well positioned ............,"Three night stay.  Very friendly and helpful staff.  Room spotless and food very good (breakfast the best for some time!).   On third floor &  traffic a little noisy.  Shuttle bus to airport just around the corner, very handy.",5,2015,03,21
226,Fantastic stay at the Fitz,"Had a great stay celebrating a friends birthday. The staff had left a note along with a bottle of prosecco in our room which was a lovely touch. All of the staff were friendly and professional, definitely my hotel of choice for Belfast. The decor may be dark for some but I loved it. The room was well stocked with everything you could need for a weekend away. Will be returning on my next visit to the city. ",5,2015,03,21
226,Excellent Service!,"Myself & husband recently stayed here for a well earned break.  The room was beautiful, the restaurant was devine for our evening meal as was the breakfast selection!!  Staff were absolutely fantastic, very attentive and not detail was missed!!! Look forward to returning!!",5,2015,03,18
226,Christmas treat,"Booked in with friendly, helpful staff to stay in a super room.I made a few awkward requests which were dealt with promptly and efficiently. My grand-daughter was treated as a welcome guest and not just tolerated. I was pleasantly surprised by the reception staff who have a professional 'can do' attitude. Restored my faith in upmarket hotels.",5,2015,03,17
226,Enjoyable stay,"My husband & I stayed here last bright as part of my Christmas present to him, we were going to a show in the Opera House & it's perfectly located. It is a little more expensive than where we would normally stay but as it was a treat I thought it would be worth it & it was. The car park charge is a little excessive at ¬£17 but the ease of just driving up & handing over the keys is worth it in my opinion. The corridors are a little dark but I liked the styling - all a matter of personal taste I suppose. We had a gorgeous room overlooking Great Victoria Street - room 601, I was very impressed with the amount of storage options & if you were to stay for a few days it would be perfect. The bathroom was massive - a full bath & separate large shower with waterfall shower head: amazing! The bed was also massive, and extremely comfortable - great quality pillows & sheets. The lighting is muted & whilst I appreciate putting on makeup would be difficult I just turned the desk lamp round & voila, problem solved. 
We headed to the bar to catch the last of the rugby & had one drink each, the round totalled over ¬£12 & for that reason it loses a star. I had a cocktail & even though I knew it was ¬£8 I was shocked at the small champagne flute portion I received, then over ¬£4 for a pint of Coors....bit of a rip off really. One thing though, I fail to understand previous reviews on the staff, from the receptionists to the concierge, to the bar staff everyone was more than pleasant. They were lovely people to deal with & made a great first & last impression. 
The hotel could do with a little face lift in places but that's to be expected anywhere really. With all that I would recommend it to anyone & I'll definitely stay again. ",4,2015,03,15
226,Wonderful,"Booked in as a christmas present for my partner, and what can I say, it was excellent, from arriving to leaving, the receptionist was so friendly and very helpful, the room was gorgeous, so clean and the bed was just perfect, bathroom also spotless, had breakfast in the hotel, it was scrumptious, the fruit so fresh, in fact it all was, we will be back ",5,2015,03,15
226,Mothers day lunch,"Have to say what a Beautiful meal and made my mother's day meal so special , great staff and made my day amazing. Great with kids , and just have to say Melony in the bar was super amazing with my daughter , she was so nice and loves her job. We have booked to come back at Easter . Your staff are amazing big thanks x",5,2015,03,15
226,Top choice for Belfast!,"I stay in Belfast quite often and have tried out most of the nice hotels at some point or another but The Fitzwilliam is always my favourite to return to. I stayed last month for the fourth time and everything was great as usual. It is by no means faultless, I have had issues with the hotel before but the professional and friendly staff, the central location, the well-appointed rooms, beautiful bathrooms and the relaxing bar still put it head and shoulders above most of the competition. I would say the only hotel better in Belfast is The Merchant - as great as the Fitzwilliam is, it doesn't go to the extra mile in the same way as The Merchant for service, luxury and attention to detail. But this is not a criticism of The Fitzwilliam as it can often be at least half the price of The Merchant and you do get great value for money. It is an outstanding property and a credit to Belfast's hospitality scene and I am always delighted to return.",5,2015,03,11
226,Perfect Suite,"Booked a suite direct with the hotel for the same price as a Travelodge in central London. Good location, beautiful interior, quiet, freestanding bath, walk in shower, free wifi, comfortable bed. Best night's sleep in a hotel in ages.",5,2015,03,10
226,Top Class,"Myself and my husband spent a Sunday night here last month and were very plesantly surprised. Firstly, we pretty much abandoned our car outside, as we weren't sure where to park, and the concierge simply took our keys and sorted it all for us. The reception staff were very friendly and efficient. We'd booked a double room and were given a free upgrade to a superior double, which was beautiful, with a double bed, sofa, stocked minibar etc. The one comment I would make is that the lighting is very bad in the corridors to the bedrooms. We had cocktails in the bar to start with and agree with other reviewers that it could do with a bit of a facelift, then we went upstairs to the restaurant, where we enjoyed a lovely meal, which was also reasonably priced. For breakfast we had the choice of either a nice-looking buffet or an a la carte cooked breakfast. As we were short for time, we took the buffet option, which was nice. This hotel is clean, well positioned, and has friendly staff to boot. Although it's a 4 star, many of the services are clearly 5 star. Would definitely stay here again.",5,2015,03,10
226,Disappointing and dreary,"Stayed at the Fitzwilliam hotel for three nights.  It was just okay - I agree with the previous comments about it looking a bit tired; it is definitely in need of a face-lift, especially the bar.  The lighting in the rooms is also terrible -a warning if you wear make-up - take a big mirror with you because you will have to put it on in the bedroom.  Very bad planning!
The various concierge gentlemen were very nice and helpful; the reception staff less so.  All pretty underwhelming I am afraid!",3,2015,03,09
226,Faultless,"We spent two nights at the Fitzwilliam in a deluxe double room, which was beautifully appointed. Extra large bed and very spacious bathroom. The staff were welcoming, charming and helpful. Breakfast included in the rate was delicious, with lots of choice.

The hotel's location is ideal as a base for the city.

Highly recommended, great stay!",5,2015,03,09
226,Excellent Stay,"We booked the Fitzwilliam for a weekend stay in Belfast and I'm delighted we did so. Upon arrival (we were very early) the receptionists were very polite and the concierge took our bags so we could go into town and explore. All of this was done with a smile and minimal fuss. The concierge also offered maps and local knowledge on where to go to eat, drink and shop. When our room was available we were delighted with it. Our bags were already in our room waiting for us. The beds are huge and VERY comfy. Quiet corridors and low lighting give the hotel an intimate feel. The bar is excellent for cocktails also. Check out was smooth and easy and they even printed out our flight tickets for us. Excellent hotel and service.",5,2015,03,09
226,another great stay in the fitzwilliam,stayed 1 night for my birthday treat. we arrived around 2.30 and the receptionist informed us that our room wasnt ready but she had upgraded us and also offered us complimentary drinks in the bar. 20 minutes later she arrived into the bar with our key cards and informed us that our bags were already in the room. i had emailed and requested a high floor room and we were on the 7th floor overlooking the grosvenor road. the bed was huge and it could have slept 3 people. really comfortable. heard no noise at night inside or outside. the room was large with windows from ground to ceiling. a 2 seater sofa and a lovely table was very welcoming. yes the room and bathroom were a little dark but that didnt bother us. the bathroom was fantastic with bath and hand shower. also a large walk in shower with a rain shower. location was fantastic for everything. i know that there are cheaper hotels in belfast but it would be very hard to pass the fitzwilliam. we will return,5,2015,03,08
226,Great hotel,"We have had a wonderful experience staying at this hotel. We stayed at The Fitzwilliam in January for three nights and would recommend it to anyone. From the first moment you arrive you feel spoiled. 
Excellent helpful, caring staff who always have a smile and will stop and have a chat with you if that's what you want. 
I would happily return here.",5,2015,03,08
226,Exceptionally High Standard,"The Fitzwilliam Hotel cannot be faulted. The room and service provided by the staff were of an exceptionally high standard.We had a very welcoming check in and arrived to the news that we had been given a ""complimentary upgrade."" The room was perfection and had a very contemporary finish. Definitely worth the money.",5,2015,03,07
226,Superb! ,"When ever visiting Belfast on business I always stop at the Fitzwilliam, from the moment you arrive and the valet parking it is a great stay. The staff couldn't be more helpful when you pull your car into the parking bay outside and walking in your bags are immediately taken from you and the staff at reception are very helpful and friendly.  The rooms are luxurious, the bed is a huge with immaculate bedlinen, the bathrooms are fantastic with double shower and the bath even has finishing touches like tea lights and a box of matches.  As I was in the bar on my own it can sometimes feel a little daunting, but the bar staff always make you feel welcome. The booths are great with a little window to the world on one side, The staff are very efficient and as soon as they see a glass empty or a dish finished they come and collect it, the food is a very good quality and I did indulge in one cocktail which was great.  Personally I would not stop anywhere else in Belfast as it is such a great central location and have such a high standard.",5,2015,03,07
226,Perfection location and beds,"Stayed 3 nights in this property. Welcomed by friendly staff at reception with a smile. First room was impression was good altho very dark but that made for a relaxing atmosphere. Bathroom looks very nice with shower and a bath separately available. Locationwise it's one block from the city's mainsquare and opposite the famous Crown bar which is worth a visit on it's own. 
Staff always available to help you out with directions or anything else needed. Taxi driver informed us a lot of the Game of Thrones cast stays at this hotel aswell as a lot of musicans. 

Beds were one of the best we've experienced in years at hotels. We suffer from back pains but after a long day of walking one night in the Fitzwilliam beds and we felt rejuvenated. Wish we could take the bed home! This made for a outstanding visit and we will be back!",5,2015,03,06
226,Lovely hotel with great service!,"My partner and I have stayed here on 2 occasions within the past few months and we have got very good deals! The hotel is beautiful and very modern. Every member of staff we have encountered on both visits have been very attentive and couldn't help us enough! The cleanliness of the hotel cannot be faulted. The only thing I think could be improved would be the quality of the food. Dinner was included in our deal but I wouldn't return if I was paying full price for a meal. I asked for a steak which was medium to well and could barely cut it. The location is perfect! Close to the opera house, bus and rail stations, shopping centre, restaurants, cinema and bars!

Will return again!",4,2015,03,05
226,"Lovely room, bad lighting","I was very excited to begin my stay in this hotel, and it was good. The staff on reception were very welcoming and my room was big, with a floor to ceiling window along one wall which allowed the room to be bright during the day, but at night, there were 4 dim lamps in each corner for light, which weren't particularly helpful when the bed is in the centre of the room. The bathroom is also big (bath and waterfall shower) but with black tiled walls and floor, is quite dark.

The bed was wonderful, and I really enjoyed my stay here. The only thing I would say was I ordered late night room service, and the chicken inside the sandwiches was stale and hard. Not great for a ¬£7 tray charge. Otherwise really enjoyed my stay - the breakfasts were much better on the food front with cooked to order pancakes and a full irish and very nice booth areas.

Would recommend.",4,2015,03,04
226,I will be back,"This hotel has a modern look in the way of the lay out, while also being cosy and relaxing, we have been their twice now, first time was for a living social high tea with champs, and second was for a meal on valentines night and on both occasions I found it to be pleasant with good service, and one of the better hotels for food, I say this because most hotels I have been in are notoriously bad for food. When we went the first time you were seated in the bar or you could choose the lobby, they had separate booths to sit in so this is good if you like a bit of privacy, the tea and sandwiches with little homemade buns were lovely and we were stuffed afterwards, good to replace a large lunch if you fancy a change.
on the second occasion when we went for our valentines meal, I also found the food to be of good quality, and the desserts were very good and all homemade by chef, this is a plus for me as most hotels would just bring desserts in from an outside caterer, I really enjoyed the Fitzwilliam on the whole just if I was to be picky, I would say that the starters are not the best choice and that we had to queue to be seated on valentines night which seemed a bit slow staffing for first impressions. We did not stay there as yet so cant comment on that experience.",4,2015,03,02
226,Great location but rooms are tired,"The hotel is in a really central location and the lobby is lovely and the staff are incredibly helpful. However the rooms are a bit tired and dark. The decor is lots of dark wood and in the room I stayed in this was damaged. The lighting in the room was really poor and the celling in the bathroom had a really bad (flaking) damp patch and a loose light fitting. 
Oh and the gym ...... Let's just say it's very small but perfectly formed for one! 
Unfortunately I also had a problem with my bill on checkout, I was over charged significantly for the room and there were drinks on my bill that absolutely were not mine (I didn't even go into the bar!). The staff were great in sorting this out but it was all unnecessary and time consuming.  ",3,2015,03,01
226,Superb,I recently stayed at the Fitzwilliam hotel and hope to do so again in the near future. The hotel is stunning with its modern spacious rooms. The staff were extremely friendly and helpful. Fantastic hotel!,5,2015,03,01
226,Just ok,Just home from a night's stay in Fitzwilliam to celebrate my husband's birthday and am completely underwhelmed by the whole experience. Arrived after the 2pm check in time to find room not ready and told to wait in the lobby. Waited over an hour without an offer of a coffee or drink only to find room had been ready for a while and they'd forgotten about us. When we got to the room it was very small and certainly not warranting the five star status. Reception staff ok but Concierge Declan very pleasant and helpful. ,2,2015,02,28
226,'Afternoon Tea at Fitzwilliam Hotel',"We had received a 'Living Social' voucher for 'Afternoon Tea' as a Christmas present and we booked to go on Saturday 21 February (the date was extended due to demand).  When we arrived we were shown to our seats and were very promptly served by the lovely Olivia who firstly checked our dietary requirements etc.   Olivia looked after us so well, checking several times if we needed more sandwiches, tea, coffee etc.   All the food provided was very fresh and very enjoyable!   Thanks again for a lovely afternoon, and to Olivia who looked after us so well!",5,2015,02,26
226,Beautiful,"My favourite hotel in belfast! Rooms are so cozy and comfortable with greens and browns, immaculately clean. We stayed twice in the 'suite' and it was just perfect. Large open plan room with double sinks and showers very romantic. Third time booked standard room but were upgraded as we previously had stayed in the suite!  Gave 4 stars instead of 5 because of the food. Yes it is lovely but portion sizes wouldn't fill an ant lol however, the rest of this beautiful hotel makes up for it! Bar area lovely with private booths separated by walls.. Again very romantic with candles on tables and dim lights.. Will be revisiting next time we are in belfast for sure! ",4,2015,02,26
226,in belfast!!!!,"Not a bad start to an afternoons day-out try the lunch menu, you will not be let-down.the food is very good , staff are great, all in all you will enjoy this hotel!!  great centre for seeing Belfast and the areas about ,EG. the Falls, Shankill, crumlin road Jail, Belfast Zoo!!!  enjoy!!!!",3,2015,02,25
226,AFTERNOON TEA ON SATURDAY 21ST FEB 2015,"Five of us went for afternoon tea, and we had a wonderful time. The food was really lovely, and well worth a visit. We were served by a Anna who was very attentive, and made us feel really welcome.
I think the standard of the food was really good, and made fresh. The staff were all friendly, and we especially liked where we were sitting which was in the enclosed seats, which were lovely and private.",5,2015,02,25
226,The Fabulous Fitzwilliam!,"Had an absolutely excellent stay at the Fitzwilliam Belfast on a recent visit to Northern Ireland! Location of the hotel was fantastic, right in the centre of the city and close to all the major attractions which made it easy to enjoy all of what Belfast had to offer in a short amount of time. The hotel was gorgeous - very chic and stylish, with a cosy fire feature in the lobby (much appreciated on a cold, rainy evening!). We even received an upgrade to a superior room, which had great views over Belfast from the full-length windows. The room was extremely comfortable (and pristine) and the bathroom was fantastic - lots of lovely toiletries to pamper with and candles on the bath ledge. Very relaxing! We thoroughly enjoyed our meal in the restuarant; the food was delicious and I'd highly recommend the sticky toffee pudding and banana ice cream! Breakfast in the morning was equally good - one of the best hotel breakfasts we have had, in fact. The service we received from all staff members deserves a particular mention - it was impeccable and they couldn't have enhanced our stay any more if they had tried! In fact, I simply couldn't write enough good things about this hotel - I'll definitely be returning soon!",5,2015,02,25
226,Great stay. Great staff. Poor food.,"Had a great stay hear. Rooms, location, staff and decor was amazing. The only thing that lets this hotel down is the food.
On arrival we were greated by a lovely receptionist who was more than helpful. She even gave us an upgrade as it was my wife's birthday. Wow.
We had booked dinner as part of our package and to be honest was dissapointed. Our waiter Tim was great and seemed genuinely interested in our stay. He recommended wine for our meal and was very attentive thoughout.
My wife had the Chicken and I had the Pork, both very ordinary.We had boiled pototoes and what can only be described as carrot crush. 
Desserts could have been better.
Breakfast the next morning was ok. Tim served us again and remembered us from the night before¬†which was great.
All in all a great stay but food should be better.",4,2015,02,23
226,Afternoon tea at Fitzwilliam hotel  Belfast,"Arrived for afternoon tea five of us. We were taken to our seats by a very nice lady called Annie. First we had champagne and tea or coffee. More tea and coffee was offered and the best sandwiches, scones buns and shortbread we have ever tasted.  Just like home baking. By far much better than the Merchant. Great value for money and the service by Annie was excellent.  We will certainly be back and now telling all our friends.  Just a wonderful afternoon.",5,2015,02,23
226,Excellent location and staff!!!,Excellent service from all the staff. They went above and beyond to ensure our stay was to our liking. The hotel is in a very central location and in close proximity to the shopping district and good bars. The room was very spacious and comfortable! The restaurant was a little over priced but the food was very tasty.,5,2015,02,23
226,Absolutely fantastic would stay here again every time im in Belfast,Had an amazing time everything from the cleaning staff to the bar staff to the reception I've never seen more friendly and yet professional staff in my life. Especially ciaran and eamon in the bar they looked after us like we were the only people there while serving everyone else in the bar - amazing experience! ,5,2015,02,23
226,"Nice room, poor food.",All staff were very helpful. The room was nice and comfortable. Very good location also. However food was very disappointing. We had a meal in the restaurant. We are both big food lovers. I had the pork which was cold. I asked for it to be reheated and the chef cooked me a new dish. It was again only lukewarm but on a very hot plate. My companion had steak which was black and tough. He asked for it to medium well but even by Irish standards this was awful! The waiting staff were very good but that did not make up for the food. We were again disappointed at breakfast. The continental was nice. I had smoked salmon and potato bread. Cheap salmon and leathery potato bread. My companion had smoked salmon benedict which was no better.,2,2015,02,22
226,No better place to stay in Belfast,"My wife and I stayed here at the beginning of our Ireland visit.  We did alot of research into where to stay in Belfast but eventually choosing this one due to its location within the city centre. It turned out to be an excellent location to all the shops and restaurants, all within walking distance. The hotel staff on arrival were friendly and welcoming.  We chose a superior room on the upper floors which gave us a good view of the city and the room itself was spacious and very comfortable. Hotel breakfast was value for money.

Hotel Concierge was outstanding and extremely helpful in our visit to the city, we even booked a private driving tour through the hotel which took us through the conventional and as well as the unknown routes of the north, quite different to what the mainstream tour companies offered.  In all an excellent experience all around.

Will definitely recommend this hotel to anyone wishing to stay in Belfast !!",4,2015,02,19
226,A bit disappointing,"HIDDEN CHARGES: ¬£18 per night to park car! (However Multi Storey round the corner charged ¬£20 for 2 nights if you show Hotel Paperwork to man at Entrance to Park).  
Reception area a bit basic & quite small.  Reception staff were all lovely except one who was a bit rude on our arrival.  
Rooms spacious with sofa which was nice.  However bed very hard & uncomfortable. (Made from timber & painted black with very hard mattress) Also noise levels are unreal!
Breakfast lovely and staff very helpful.  However not worth ¬£16.50 pp. Some of seats again made from timber & covered.  Very hard and uncomfortable",3,2015,02,19
226,Very enjoyable stay!,"I stayed in the Fitzwilliam on 31st January & would definitely recommend! Lovely rooms, very clean, high floor as requested but would have preferred a room at the front of the hotel rather than the side. The meal in the restaurant was really good, great service.  I have also stayed in the Merchant but think the Fitzwilliam is much better value for money!",5,2015,02,18
226,Perfect ÔøΩÔøΩ,"Wonderful stay. The bed was massive and really comfy. The way the room and bathroom and decorated/designed is stunning and not like anywhere we have stayed before. The service was exceptional. Friendly staff and a nice little touch of truffles for my husband on his birthday. The view from our huge window was beautiful, right across the city and into the surrounding hills. Very special. We would defo stay there again and highly recommend to anyone else :)",5,2015,02,18
226,Enjoyable night,What a hotel could of sat in bar all night relaxing atmosphere friendly staff great drink menu.  Room with amazing views.  Couldn't have asked for better.  Would definitely go back - hopefully very soon.,5,2015,02,18
226,disappointed,"was very disappointed room was very balnd looking - expected more for what was paid. the room was too warm, air con didnt work (my friend stayed here and had the same problem also) - was woken up at 7AM by the alarm going off - so much for a lie in! good location but would not advise to stay!",2,2015,02,18
226,Solid Choice,"I have stayed several times in the Fitzwilliam over the last two years.

Rooms are excellent and food and beverage very good. (Service at the bar can be slow on occasion). Location is ideal for locals and travellers alike.

If possible get a deluxe room with the floor to celing windows. 

Probably the best pound for pound hotel in the city, only inferior to the Merchant but costs half the price.",4,2015,02,17
226,City centre location,"Great base for exploring the city. Comfy, great friendly staff. Always willing to help and ensure you get the best from your visit. We enjoyed a nice meal in the restaurant that was real value for money. I couldn't recommend this hotel enough. ",4,2015,02,15
226,Great Place for Afternoon Tea,"We were treated as a gift to afternoon tea in the restaurant at the Fitzwilliam Hotel, Belfast. We thoroughly enjoyed the experience, the food was great and we had a very attentive and delightful  waitress called Anna.",5,2015,02,14
226,Excellent hotel!,Stayed here for the first time and will definitely be returning :) Staff were all very friendly and helpful. Room was spacious and finished to a high standard. We had some lovely cocktails in the bar which had a great atmosphere and the staff attended to us so well. Would definitely recommend this hotel :),5,2015,02,12
226,Overpriced parking for residents!,"Stayed here for one night whilst we visited the titanic, it was only when we arrived at the hotel that we discovered that parking costs 17pounds per night! I thought this was a disgrace to have to pay this much for parking! 
Overall, the hotel was lovely, rooms are modern and clean and toilets are classy, we had dinner in the restaurant which was 5 star class! Lots of staff in resturant and very friendly and willing to do anything to help. Even able to offer dishes that was not on the menu, Highly recommend the restaurant.

Overall, the price of the hotel was quiet expensive without including the price of parking! Based on the price I would not return! Id get a 5 star hotel for the same price!",3,2015,02,11
226,Luxury in the city,"I stayed here for two nights and it was a lovely, if anonymous, stay. The room was stylish and comfortable. our safe didn't work and the staff were apologetic and helpful. Downside was waiting for the lifts, very slow and the extortionate parking costs. Great location though!",4,2015,02,09
226,Smart and stylish,"Great location in the centre of Belfast.

Friendly and helpful staff.

Smart and stylish rooms, dripping with contemporary decor.

Great bathrooms with a powerful shower.

The 'gym' is a bit of a joke but this isn't the kind of place you come to use the leisure facilities.

",4,2015,02,09
226,Lovely hotel,Was staying elsewhere but wanted to have quite drink. The staff were brilliant and accommodating. The atmosphere was good and didn't feel the background music was of a excessive nature. The next time I visit it'll be to stay over and I can't wait.,4,2015,02,09
226,Great Location,"Great hotel in a great location.
The girl in the bar looked like her face might break if she smiled.
We weren't told that our car was going to cost ¬£17 for overnight parking. 
Dont mind paying it but I do mind when they just charge without letting me know? 
",5,2015,02,08
226,Great location,"We stayed here last Dec for 3 nights as we explored Belfast and checked out the Christmas market. The location is great, really central, short distance to main shopping area, Christmas Market and many restaurants. We walked to Queens, but you would need good shoes, takes about 30 mins. The hotel is a good distance from the Titanic Quarter, it isn't walkable. The hotel is beautifully decorated, the rooms and bathrooms are comfortable, the gym is small but well equipped. The bar does great cocktails and the lounge area is cozy with the open fire. I would recommend this hotel for a Belfast short break.",5,2015,02,07
226,Overnight stay,"We stayed at this hotel on 1/2/15 as it was a present from our son; dinner, B&B included in the deal.  The receptionist was very helpful and polite and couldn't do enough for us; we also   managed to get a free upgrade to a superior room and I have to admit the room was fantastic!  All the staff made us feel very welcome. Our dinner deal was part of a set menu and the food was great, the waiter who looked after us was very professional and definitely made our evening. Breakfast was your standard Ulster Fry or continental and again my wife and I thoroughly enjoyed our food and the treatment received from the hotel staff. I would definitely recommend this hotel; the staff were very professional and polite, location great.  We shall be going back. Thank you!",5,2015,02,05
226,Fabulous,"My wife and I spent Sunday night at the Fitswilliam and really enjoyed our short stay. The front desk, bar staff, dining room staff and concierge all showed a high quality of service with a caring attitude. We will return. ",5,2015,02,04
226,Birthday weekend,"Stunning hotel. Room was modern, spotlessly clean & spacious. Bathroom was gorgeous & again spotlessly clean & spacious. 
Wasn't overly impressed with the breakfast. Have had better.  
Would definitely stay here again but probably wouldn't bother booking the breakfast.",4,2015,02,03
226,Amazing,Excellent service and fantastically appointed room. Got a last minute deal for $95 USD per night via Kayak. Location right in the city is great and the wifi was strong. Staff was very friendly and will help to arrange tours too.,5,2015,02,03
226,Quite Good but let down by restaurant.,"We possibly had too high expectations of this place and while it is a very good hotel, it's not quite brilliant. A lot of things that make a place 5 star were sorely lacking. Food being the main one. That said, the staff were (with one exception) extremely pleasant and polite. Location is brilliant.

We arrived on Saturday afternoon and were greeted by a lovely lady at reception, our package was a one nights stay with evening meal but were disappointed when told that because we hadn't reserved dinner we'd have to wait until 9pm (more on dinner below) and this was disappointing as we did not know we had to ring and book dinner in advance. Maybe a lesson learned. Ended up getting a pizza across the road to tide us over.

Room was lovely, beautifully comfortable king size bed, soft pillows, perfect! Heating was fiddly to work and found it hard to find the right setting. But the bathroom is amazing! Lovely big shower and bath. But the shower gel and shampoo was too small. Normally I bring my own with me but, given that this is a 5 star hotel, I'd expected better. I've stayed in 3 star hotels and found much better toiletries (both quality and size) so it wouldn't take much to sort that out. They also had a great hair dryer!

Dinner was nice, not mind blowing cuisine and the place was half empty, making us wonder was it really so busy from 7pm that we couldn't get a slot until 9pm?? Starters were extremely poor. Prawn Cocktail which was pub standard, husbands pork belly which was incinerated with a non-existent chizoro and a raw pear. Bizarre. The mains of steak and salmon were good. But not spectacular. Dessert was average, they were ""out"" of our choice of chocolate tart. Got a cheesecake which literally tasted of nothing and a sickly sweet berry crumble. But the service was very good, very attentive and prompt.

The bar is good, the lads making cocktails were extremely good at their job and were very pleasant when asked various questions about what they were making! The lady in the trouser suit, collecting glasses and generally marching around the place was not as pleasant and quite abrupt!

Our room was opposite the lift but we weren't disturbed at all by noise at night. 

Breakfast was nice, standard continental plus order at table for full Irish. My only gripe here is that, the cooked breakfasts are quite obviously not cooked to order (apart from the eggs) because the sausage and bacon were both dry and crispy, while the potato bread was rubber hard around the edges. Sitting on a hot plate under a heat lamp for quite a while. I've stayed in another 5 star hotel where a full Irish breakfast is literally cooked fresh. Can't understand why the Fitzwilliam can't up its game here.

Probably wouldn't stay here again, mainly due to food.",3,2015,02,03
226,Wouldn't go anywhere else now,"Me and my boyfriend went for an overnight stay on a Sunday. Arrived before 2pm check in time and room was ready- good start. Couldn't fault the reception staff, very pleasant and asked us if we had any plans or needed any assistance with recommendations etc. Also the conceirge staff were great and very attentive. The rooms were lovely, very modern and spacious. Couldn't get over the size of the shower! Beds were very big and super comfy. 
We decided to have lunch in the bar, the decor was cosy and overall atmosphere was good! I had soup which was lovely and boyfriend had Piri Piri chicken wings. Only thing to fault would be the wings being so spicy. Very hot!! But other than that, great! We also had a couple of drinks in the bar, I had a pear drop cocktail- to die for. So nice. 
The location of the hotel is good as it isn't too far from bars etc and there is a Tesco express and centra just opposite which is handy. 
We didn't have breakfast or dinner in the hotel so cannot comment. We were so impressed with the hotel that we booked again when we were checking out lol! Coming back in April for our anniversary, staying in the corner room (as recommended by receptionist-very friendly with funky haircut) and I cannot wait! My new favourite hotel!",5,2015,02,02
226,Lovely hotel but let down by the restaurant,"Gorgeous rooms, comfy bed and friendly helpful staff but disappointed by the restaurant. Not in keeping with the theme of the hotel and very plane. Had breakfast and afternoon tea which was fine but not impressed with the decor and there was no atmosphere. Went elsewhere for our dinner!",4,2015,01,31
226,Awesome Afternoon Tea!,Attended the hotel today to have Afternoon Tea a gift from a friend. The Hotel sits beside the Grand Opera House in Belfast 2 minutes walk from the Train station. we were booked for Afternoon Tea which was served in the first floor restaurant.  afternoon Tea was served with a glass of Champagne what a delightful way to spend the afternoon. Everything from start to finish was perfect. we will be back!,5,2015,01,31
226,Amazing ,"Stayed in this hotel for one night. I've stayed in a quiet a few high quality hotels around the world..and this would definitely be in my top 5. The bedroom was amazing, I couldn't find a fault even if I tried. I can't wait to go back",5,2015,01,31
226,'Shitzwilliam Hotel Belfast',"Awful one night stay on 7th January. Complained directly to the hotel management enquiry email on the 14th January and have yet to receive a reply. The lack of respect with regards to a guest's feedback is both highly disrespectful and careless. Shocking customer service and serious lack of competence shown from the start to finish.  

Our complaint went as follows;

- Cold 'welcome' by Front Desk

- Ordered a cheese board with a light assortment of meats and a bottle of the house red from In Room Dining in the early evening. 'Cheese' board arrived with no cheese, but instead had a few slices of salami, and after ringing down to correct the issue, the cheese was delivered after 20 minutes, but with no crackers. The house red was appalling. It was a mixture of a Shiraz and a Malbec and was embarrassingly poor for a hotel of such 'standard'.

- At check out, we informed Front Desk of such an issue after realising the delivery charge for the IRD order was ¬£7. They informed us that the cheese board and delivery charge would be refunded in full. However, after one week of checking our bank statement, this was not the case and nothing was done, despite their 'promise'. 

- Upon arriving at the hotel, we informed Front Desk that we would be checking out between 1pm and 2pm the following day, regardless of the ¬£10 excess hourly charge which we didn't mind. Front Desk advised us that this was not a problem. Yet, on the day of check out, between 12pm and 2pm  we received four phone calls and three separate members of staff personally coming to the room door to consistently inform us that the hotel's check out time was 12pm. We found this approach extremely dismissive and unwelcoming, especially given the fact that we had informed Front Desk upon check in of our late check out time. 

- When we arrived at Front Desk to check out just before 2pm, the first question we were asked was - ""Did you receive your bill which was slid under your room door?"" Now forgive our lateness, but such blunt mannerisms left us in disbelief. 

We strongly advise that the level of customer service from all staff members be emphasised in order to make a guests' experience at least satisfactory. At present, the hotel's is unacceptable and nothing short of an embarrassment. 

Obviously we are expecting some form of a reply with respect to our initial complaint via email on the 14th and now for this present one. Surely the Fitzwilliam have some form of respect and decency for its clientele, rather than simply ignoring negative feedback?",1,2015,01,30
226,Amazing,"My friend and I booked to stay here Sat 24th January, AMAZING is the word to sum up our stay. From arrival at reception we were made so welcome and the girls were so helpful and friendly nothing was a bother and the bar staff were lovely. We had a slight issue in our room with the heating and our concierge came to sort it straight away he was so helpful,friendly and nice.When he could not get it fixed they upgraded our room which was out of this world the most amazing upgrade ever. The next morning breakfast was delicious and it was lovely to see Eggs Benedict on a hotel breakfast menu. Also the same staff were back on in the morning and as friendly as when we first arrived,I can't wait to go back the service and atmosphere through out was lovely. Thank you so much.",5,2015,01,28
226,Lovely central hotel,Stayed here one night in business lovely big bed nice lighting bar looked nice although not used lobby decor beautiful very tastefully done. Staff very helpful and friendly didn't have time for breakfast bathroom nice one drawback not enough shampoo and shower gel great big bath though  35 mins away from airport ¬£35 a taxi costs to airport,5,2015,01,28
226,Good And Bad,"First the good. Beautiful hotel. Made to feel very welcome and special on arrival by reception staff. Room was a delight to go into. Warm and everything there that was useful for our stay. It all lived up to our expectations for our wedding anniversary. Now the bad. Our evening meal was something else. Bottle tops in water, dirty cutlery, no steak knife, wrong side orders, took third time to get steak correct and we had four different people serving at our table. Not what we expected for our special dinner. However, once the assistant manageress,lauren, was made aware of this,her professionalism shone. She apologised for the terrible experience we had. Gave us complementry wine and we had no expense to pay that night. She couldnt have been nicer or done anymore for us. Its a pity that our dining experience was bad because other than this, it was a beautiful hotel to stay in.",4,2015,01,27
226,"Great location, service and rooms good","Very good location right in city centre. Lots of things to do nearby.

Service is good, check-in very friendly although could be a bit quicker. Rooms are modern, clean, well-equipped. Wifi works well and is free.

As a business traveller, only point I would make is that breakfast starts at 07.00, would be good if could be earlier as thats quite late if you have meetings, add to that hot breakfasts are ordered individually and you don't have time to have much beyond a bowl of cereal and some bread with hams.",4,2015,01,27
226,Great service great hotel at great price!,"A real winner! A lot more of a luxurious hotel at budget hotel prices. Great friendly service, nothing ever too much trouble. Thanks..
Quiet nights sleep on luxury beds
PS Wifi was good bandwidth Internet coverage allowing a considerable amount of work to be done without interruption!",5,2015,01,27
226,"Cool, cool, cool","Had a weekend stay at the Fitzwilliam in January and couldn't recommend it enough. We travelled by bus and the station is less than 5 mins walk away +++++

Hotel has a very relaxing atmosphere, which is exactly what we wanted +++++

Location was ideal as it was  in the centre of Belfast +++++

Restaurant was reasonably price with a very good menu (it was the only place we dined in during the weekend) +++++

Staff very friendly and the room itself was very well decorated, spacious and very clean +++++

Bottom line if you have a complaint you need your head examined!!!!

We will without doubt be back.",5,2015,01,27
226,Failed to meet expections,"Purchased Living Social voucher for afternoon tea at the Fitzwilliam.  Looked forward to this having enjoyed the same last year. What a disappointment!  Coffee undrinkable, sandwiches hard and fillings unexciting-egg, tuna, and processed ham.  Normal menu shows baked ham, salmon, and chicken!  In summary cafeteria service in a 5* hotel.  Not good for locals and certainly a poor reflection of our catering for tourists!",1,2015,01,26
226,beautiful hotel let down by the food,"I booked a one night stay for my husband's birthday. I got a fantastic price on last-minute.com and would have happily paid far more.
The hotel's location couldn't be better, within easy walking distance of a lot of the major attractions in Belfast. The Grand Opera House is immediately next door and it is surrounded by great restaurants, which as I'll get to later is probably a good thing.
First impressions of the Fitzwilliam Hotel were fantastic. Beautifully decorated lobby with a lovely atmosphere provided by a fire and lovely low lighting. We were greeted on arrival by a lovely concierge who offered to help with bags etc - a nice touch. The receptionist was lovely -very efficient + polite. Decor throughout the hotel is modern and classy, although with far too many mirrors for my liking. 
We stayed in a standard double room on the 5th floor and were delighted with it. Spacious room with every convenience you could think of to hand. Comfy king size bed, sofa, desk/dressing table and lots of storage. The bathroom was fantastic - large with huge deep bath + separate shower cubicle with great power shower. Well stocked mini bar, good pay per view movie selection, CD player + even a wireless keyboard were provided.
We decided to have dinner in the restaurant expecting great things from a 5* hotel. We chose to eat from the pre-theatre menu which is great value and I'm glad we did because I can't imagine the food on the a la carte menu would have justified the prices. Our starters were the big let down. I had a prawn cocktail which consisted of small prawns in a tasteless marie rose sauce on chopped tomato + lettuce with a tiny wedge of dried out wheaten bread on the side - not great. My husband had pork belly (cremated + dry as a bone) with raw pear (odd), blue cheese dip (unable to taste the cheese at all) + no sign of the promised chorizo. Main course was considerably better - rump steak + roast chicken - both tasty but both would have been more at home in a gastropub than in a 5* restaurant. Dessert again nice but nothing to write home about - Irish cream cheesecake with a random dollop of bitter chocolate sauce which would have benefited from the addition of fruit + cream + sticky toffee pudding with ice cream which was allegedly banana but didn't have the slightest hint of banana. Over all acceptable food but nothing special. We should probably have been alerted by the fact that the restaurant was practically empty. 
The other issue for me was the lack of sound proofing. Because of the centrality of the location I found myself awake very early in the morning due to traffic noise, ambulance sirens + church bells - obviously none of these things can be attributed to the Fitzwilliam Hotel but I feel sure that better sound proofing is a possibility. 
Overall I was impressed by the hotel and would happily return but I would eat elsewhere.",4,2015,01,26
226,"Lovely hotel,  great location,  poor service!","Stayed here for a weekend in January. Hotel is lovely, great location and rooms are modern but I wouldn't regard the experience as 5 star. Service is a let down which I think is key to the experience.  Although I must note the concierge service is second to none and the guys are so helpful.

First issue with service was breakfast,  it states on the hotel information printed in the room that breakfast is served on Saturday and Sunday until 11.30 however when we arrived at 10.50 we were told it finishes at 10.30am.  We went downstairs and the concierge recommended a cafe nearby which was gorgeous, however we were a little annoyed about the mix up and had to rush to our prebooked tour.

Later on that afternoon we went to the bar,  lovely atmosphere in the bar with afternoon tea and cocktails being quite popular but service was really slow which isn't really five star. We were approached and handed cocktail menus. I asked to see a food menu at which point cocktail menu was taken from me. At least 10 minutes passed and nobody took our order so I approached the bar, but the three guys behind the bar were busy making cocktails and didn't seem to be taken orders so I stood there for a few minutes and a member of staff approached to take the order.   We ordered a soup,  club sandwich, baileys coffee and tea.  It took at least another 10-15 for drinks to arrive and another five or more for the food.  Also the table next to us were having afternoon tea but there seemed to be a mix up with their order and they didn't seem pleased with poor service either.   Really a pity as it has so much potential. I still enjoyed my stay as I had gotten a good deal but I would be been extremely disappointed I'd I had paid full price. Also yet again the concierge recommended an amazing restaurant for later that evening and booked this for us they were so helpful! ",3,2015,01,25
226,Lovely Hotel,"This is a lovely hotel in the centre of Belfast, next door to the Grand Opera and across the road from the famous Crown Bar. The bedroom was a good size and the bed was very comfortable. There was both a bath and walk-in shower. All the staff were very friendly and helpful, there are even complimentary umbrellas for the usual rain! Breakfast was excellent with the cooked breakfast freshly prepared. A word of caution, it takes a little time to arrive, therefore, if you are in a hurry, think Continental. I would recommend this hotel.",4,2015,01,25
226,Best in Belfast,"I stay here often as I have a lot of business trips to Belfast.  Very modern excellent rooms (especially the superior ones).  The staff are always and without exception friendly, efficient and helpful
Great for breakfast - cooked to order so no dried up egg etc. on the buffet counter.
Eat in the restauarnt or for something lighter try the bar food.",5,2015,01,23
226,Awful service at restaurant - stay clear!!,"Stayed over as a birthday treat, expecting 5* service!! Wrong. Staff at reception were helpful and polite. Room was clean and a nice size although there were marks on the walls and the ceiling and the TV was something you would expect to find in a 2* B&B.

The worst part though was the restaurant. Having claiming to be 'astonishing' I felt what better place for a birthday meal? Wrong. FOUR different people waited on our table for some bizarre reason. Bought out the wrong drinks, which we pointed out and got a sarcastic sorry.

Ordered bread and it came with some kind of receipt (obviously meant for the waiters) or they replaced the butter with it as it came out without butter.

We ordered the steak. A man came and swapped one knife for steak knifes as usual, then another girl came and took our starter knifes away?? To which I pointed out to waiter number three only to be told 'sorry' and bought them back out to us.

Our starter of salmon was served without the cream cheese or whatever it was meant to be served with as I'm sure it wasn't meant to be served on its own!

The steak we ordered rare - came out medium... By this time we had lost hope in getting anything but bad service so stayed quiet! But seeing as though we paid over ¬£100 for a meal for 2 persons (a la carte menu). We were expecting something special! Food wasn't anything special at all, had better quality and imagination in local restaurants! 

One of the waitresses' attitude and customer service skills could do with a brush up, having a laugh and a joke and a little flirt with the two men sitting opposite us and could hardly squeeze out a smile for us!! Overall the restaurant was badly run, no communication at all. 

Very much a let down! Shame really as it looks like an amazing hotel!",2,2015,01,23
226,Afternoon Coffee!,"Called in to hotel to relax and enjoy a coffee before catching train. Outside was bitterly cold and damp. I took a welcome seat in a very pleasant and comfortable reception area and ordered a coffee and some pastries. Picked up a newspaper while I waited to be served. 
Both the service and standard of food served was excellent. Brian went out of his way to ensure everything was perfect. 
A group of ladies were enjoying afternoon tea served in front of a very modern stylish gas fire. I will definitely return to sample this experience. Too soon I had to leave to catch my train. My highest compliments to The Fitzwilliam for a most enjoyable afternoon treat. Without doubt, the highlight of my shopping day in Belfast. I will be back, 
perhaps next time as a guest. ",5,2015,01,22
226,Wonderful hotel,Booked to stay here to celebrate our anniversary and it was fantastic from the moment we checked in. We arrived early from our flight from Edinburgh and the staff on the front desk were brilliant (Melissa especially) and got us into our room earlier than planned. Room was spacious and the bathroom was beautiful. Matress was heaven! The concierge were lovely and suggested great places to see and things to do- really sold Belfast well to us! The level of service and attention to detail made us feel valued and we will certainly consider coming back. ,5,2015,01,22
226,Very Enjoyable,"My partner and I spent two nights here for my birthday in late November/early December. The Hotel is very modern and quite central, with some lovely views over Belfast. The staff were a delight and made us feel very at ease. The room was nice and again, very modern, however, smaller than we had imagined based on the picture on the hotel website. One negative thing, is that they swiped my credit card at reception upon arrival in the event that we wanted to charge anything to the room. What they did not tell me is that since we were paying upon departure, they took a security deposit of ¬£200 from my card which I did not get back for 5 days post the stay. I was quite disappointed with this. Also, the allocated amounted of hotel cark park spaces is terrible considering the amount of rooms in the hotel. We had to park across the road in a public cark park and waiting an hour to get in to it. Despite this, we would return.",4,2015,01,21
226,Rip off,Just returned from a stay in the fitzwilliam hotel in Belfast  having stayed in the fitzwilliam in Dublin many times we were really looking foreword to it but were we disappointed.we booked with booking .com like we always do and it said pay on the day of stay but I realised a few days prior to stay the hotel had taken the full amount out of my account .the hotel was very busy as it was a Saturday night but there was no where to sit to have a drink when we found a seat they wouldn't serve us food in that area even though the people sitting there before us had eaten at that table so we had to leave the hotel and go find somewhere to eat . There was no bath robes in the room no bottled water and they had no turn down service all are services that they have in the Dublin hotel.on check out i was told everything was payed in full but this morning I discovered they had taken ‚Ç¨23.57 out of my account for the car park I hadn't been informed on check in there was a fee for the car park . Never again .,2,2015,01,21
226,Afternoon tea here a real treat!,"Four of us had afternoon tea here recently after purchasing a voucher on LivingSocial. It was a lovely treat for us all with plenty of tea or coffee, sandwiches, scones, shortbread, sweet treats and a glass of presecco as part of the deal! Great value! The staff were friendly and helpful adding to the whole experience. I would definitely recommend it and will return in the future myself.",5,2015,01,18
226,Good hotel,Good hotel with excellent location. Irish breakfast the perfect way to start the day and would recommend.  Staff very helpful and obliging. Will definitely return. Think this is one of tgd best hotels in Belfast.,5,2015,01,17
226,Beautiful surroundings for city break,"Had a lovely two night mid week stay here. Absolutely delicious meal in the bar on night one along with exquisite cocktails and really well paced waiting staff. Not too much, not too little. Yummy breakfast both days. Only downsides were no spa, no onsite parking and not cheap. But, as a second time visitor it hasn't put me off too much and would stay again for a special occasion.",4,2015,01,16
226,Not deserving of a 4 star rating,"I booked an overnight stay in the Fitzwilliam Hotel recently for a birthday treat for my partner. We wanted to visit the Titanic exhibition and do a city bus tour. We have been to Belfast many times for day trips, so this was intended as a relaxing couple of days. I found I could not book the required accommodation online, due to some fault on the hotel system. I then phoned the hotel to make the booking. A very nice girl took the booking details and said she would make a note that it was to celebrate a birthday.
We arrived on Saturday at 1pm, and the concierge came outside to park our car, which I had booked in advance. (This cost 17 pounds sterling). We proceeded to check in, and waited in line as there were other guests ahead of us. When I checked in, the girl on reception, called Melissa, was extremely helpful and friendly. She told me however that the room was not ready,  and would be about be approx another 10 minutes before she could check us in officially and give me the room passes. That was fine I told her, and we waited in the lobby area. Meanwhile, at least another 14 people arrived, checked in and were given their room passes, and they proceeded to the guest lifts, to their rooms. After approx 15 minutes of waiting, I again approached the reception desk and enquired what the room situation was. Melissa checked, and told me it still was not ready. My partner asked me if they might have another room available rather than wait for the room which had been assigned to us, on the 7th floor. When I put this to Melissa, she told me that the room we had been assigned was a really nice room, with wonderful views. She told me also that the hotel was fully booked. Another receptionist again checked, and told us that the room still was not ready, and it would be approx another half an hour. At this stage, this other receptionist suggested we go to the bar and have complimentary tea or coffee, and she would come to the bar with the room passes when the room was ready. We had coffee, served by a very nice barman called Paul. I tried to access my emails on my Tablet whilst waiting in the bar, but was unable to do so. Paul was most helpful, but even with his assistance, I was unable to access the wifi. I went back out to the reception and the 2nd receptionist was still there. She got me a temporary code in order to access the wifi (my hotel details had not been logged on, as we were still not officially checked in). I returned to the bar and accessed my emails. Paul kindly offered us a 2nd coffee, which we declined. At 2.15pm, I again approached the reception desk. There was a different girl there. When I asked what was happening regarding the room, she checked the computer and said ""That room is ready, and it has been ready for some time.""  She also told us that our luggage was already gone up to the room. We were exasperated at this, since the 2nd girl who dealt with us, had told us to go to the bar for coffee, and that she would come and give us the room passes as soon as the room was ready. I fully understand that officially check-in time is 2pm, and we had arrived at 1pm, and that availing of an earlier check-in time is discretionary. However, given the number of guests who arrived shortly after us and they were all accommodated immediately, this being between 1pm-1.20pm approx, we were at a loss to understand what was the huge delay in our case. I did hope for a wonderful room, after all that, and was expecting that the delay was going to be worthwhile. Sadly, no.....the room was just average. Yes, there probably were good views.....if you could see out of the window. There was such bad condensation on the window, the water was quite literally running down the window. This did not improve during our stay. The room temperature was extremely chilly, and given that that particular day was probably the coldest for some time, the room should have been warm and welcoming. We had to change our plans then, as we had intended doing the bus tour one day, and the Titanic exhibition the next  day. But by this time, we would not have had sufficient time to do either tour in its entirety. Instead we went walking around for a while, before coming back to the hotel to get changed for dinner. I had booked dinner for 7.15pm, and had mentioned that it was a birthday meal. On arriving in the restaurant, we were greeted warmly and led to our table. We were presented with menus and the wine list. The waitress then returned to our table, with 2 glasses of Prosecco, as she said ""I understand it's somebody's birthday today."" This was a lovely gesture, and was much appreciated by us both, and we told the waitress so. We then got to the business of ordering our meal and wine. The wine list, for a 4 star hotel, was most disappointing. From a selection of just 8 red wines on offer, we opted for our first choice. We ordered scallops to start, followed by the main dish of beef as stated on the menu, accompanied by a couple of side dishes. Shortly after, the waitress returned, and very apologetically told us that our chosen wine was not available. We then studied the list of the remaining 7 wines, and selected our 2nd choice. The waitress left and returned very quickly, to tell us that our 2nd choice of wine was not available. As I then perused the wine list yet again, I realised that of the remaining 6 wines listed (available? Who knows), there were none that we particularly cared for. As we were discussing our next move, the restaurant manager, called Patrick, came to the table, and very apologetically said that there was no more of the beef main course we had chosen left. At this point I really felt I had run out of options, when my partner said to Patrick that he would have the monk tail from the menu as his 2nd choice of main. And, lo and behold, Patrick then said that there were no more monk tails available. At that stage, I said to Patrick that we would have to leave, and eat elsewhere. I asked him how had such a situation happened, in a 4 star city centre hotel on a Saturday night, with the hotel booked to capacity. Surely there has to be someone in charge of ordering, and stock control. Patrick could only apologise. We asked where we might go at that time on a Saturday night, in order to get a decent meal. Patrick said he would phone the Concierge, and ask him to try to source a restaurant for us. I said we would need to fetch our coats and rain gear, as we had not anticipated leaving the hotel that evening, and it was raining. We told Patrick we would be in the foyer in approx 10 minutes. On arriving in the foyer, we approached the Concierge, who was completely unaware of our plight. (The following day, Patrick told us he had phoned the reception desk, asking that the Concierge be made aware of the situation, and that we would be arriving presently. The receptionist clearly never passed on the message) Gerard, the Concierge was most efficient and helpful once he realised our predicament. However he was unable to get a table for us in the first 2 restaurants of choice. He managed to get us booked into a restaurant close enough by, but we needed to take a taxi (which Gerard ordered), as we were unfamiliar with the area where the restaurant was situated, and it was also raining and extremely cold. We eventually got to enjoy a very nice fillet steak dinner accompanied by an excellent bottle of red wine, in a restaurant called The Square. Before we left in the taxi, I approached the reception desk and told the girl that as we were not dining in the hotel as planned, a deduction should be made. She asked was there any particular reason why we were not dining in the hotel, to which I replied, ""Yes, four reasons in fact. 2 wines we selected were not available, and the kitchen had run out of both the beef  main course and the monk tail."" She said she would have 30 pounds sterling deducted from the bill. I said, ""I'm sorry, it's for 2 four course dinners."" She said yes, and that 30 pounds would be deducted. I asked then what amount I would be billed for, the following morning. She said 135 pounds sterling. I told her I would not pay 135 pounds for bed & breakfast, in what was clearly not a 4 star hotel. She said she would speak to the Manager. 
Later that night, an envelope containing the bill was slipped under the door of our room. It was for 85 pounds sterling for bed & breakfast, and also 17 pounds for the valet parking, a total of 102 pounds sterling. 
The following morning we had a reasonably early breakfast, as we now had to get 2 tours done before setting off for home. The restaurant manager Patrick, was again on duty, and was most welcoming and enquired how our previous night had finished up. He again was extremely apologetic about the whole situation. We enjoyed a nice breakfast and were almost ready to leave the table, when Patrick returned . He told us he had organised with the Concierge to arrange 2 complimentary tickets for the city bus tour. He again apologised for the way things had gone for us, and hoped we would return at some future stage. We thanked him for the tickets, a gesture we appreciated. 
After checking out, as we were waiting for the shuttle bus to arrive to take us to the city bus tour departure point, we again spoke to Patrick in the foyer. It seems he was also working as the Duty Manager that morning. He told us that there was to be a Managers' meeting the following morning and he would highlight the various issues which we encountered. 
On a positive note, each staff member we met, was very friendly and polite, and welcoming, as individuals. It was such a shame that the whole package which we experienced was so disjointed, and not as satisfying for the purpose of a birthday treat, as I had been anticipating. 
I understand decor is a matter of personal choice. However, I feel I should mention our thoughts. On our initial arrival, before we encountered any problems, we had time to look around the foyer area, whilst waiting for our room. We both felt that the entrance & foyer areas were very drab and dreary. The long net curtains covering the windows actually looked dirty, and the overall impression we felt, was of a dark, almost depressing area. The furnishings in both the foyer and the bar areas were not at all of a standard we would associate with a 4 star hotel. 
In summary, a very disappointing experience. As stated earlier, the staff were most friendly and eager to help. But there was no consistency or smooth-flowing interaction apparent among  the staff. We would like to acknowledge particularly the restaurant manager Patrick, and the Concierge, Gerard. They were by far the most professional in how they tried to rectify the difficulties we encountered.",2,2015,01,15
226,"Great, except the snoring","Lots of strong points - location, ambience, room design and size, breakfast, nice people. Opposite the famous Crown, near the station. However this is a purpose built modern hotel, so I should not really be able to hear the person in the next room snoring - or their TV when they turned it on in the morning.",3,2015,01,15
226,Lots of little failings,"Stayed at this hotel as the Merchant was full and was really disappointed.  Lots of little things just built up so it is not an amazing hotel as I was expecting.

Firstly the receptionists were amazing, really warm welcome really informative and friendly, even better than the Merchant.  Entering my room - it was small, odd layout squeezed into the corner and absolutely freezing.  The room tempature was on the lowest setting, I assumed this had been left by the previous resident but I then learnt that this is a daily action of house keeping so every evening on returning to the room it was like an icebox.  Given that I stayed when it was snowing outside it isn't the best of welcomes to your room.
The bathroom has an ice cold tiled floor and no heating so takes the warmth from the room - again very cold the entire stay.  The rail in the shower is half off and rattles, the plug in the bath didn't open up without using your fingers to prise it open, the sink didn't run hot water until I got the bath tap to run hot water, there is very little shelf space for storing things - and I don't have that many things to store in the bathroom.
The room itself was quite small, the window was a tiny corner window which seemed to let in a massive cold draft all of the time. The road noise was not great, I didn't need an alarm any morning for getting up at 7am as the traffic noises woke me each morning.  The storage is basic but small, the tv is frustrating as you have to go through 4 menus to get onto bbc1 and the channels are in a wacky order so moving between them requires menu activiation again.  There wasn't a pen in the room to fill in the breakfast menu - at least I couldn't find one despite searching the few drawers.  There isn't a master off switch for the lights so you have to find all the switches before going to bed - housekeeping put them all on during their visit. 
I ate in the bar one evening, the food was fantastic, the cocktails were nice but the service was fairly slow and sporadic.  It was a quiet evening and the staff were attentive at times but not continually.  But again - the food was fantastic and great value.  Breakfast was also good but having 30 minute slots for service to you room is pretty poor to help you plan your day, 15 minute slots would be much better and have litle impact on the hotel staff.
The gym was a bedroom, quite literally it was my room a few floors down.  It is a small carpeted room where the tempature doesn't seem to be set to the minimum and there is no real air conditioning.  There is a treadmill, cross trainer, bike and rower none of which were in use by anyone else when I visited.  There is also a small water fountain but no toilet as the room is too small.  Quite the weirdest gym I have visited in a hotel.
So I won't be back.  The front of house staff seemed really good and attentive but there are some basic flaws in the service the hotel provides and a lack of attention to detail.",3,2015,01,14
226,Lovely stay at the Fitzwilliam,"Took the better half away for a weekend and decided on this hotel for the balance of quality and price. We arrived late (9.45) on Friday and was informed that there wasn't anywhere to get food after 9.30 in the hotel bar the 24hr menu, perhaps a suggestion for the concierge to find somewhere open late might of gone down well. The room was well appointed and well equipped everything we hoped and wanted ventured into the city and had a great time. We came back and had a quick drink in the bar, the drinks were good but not spectacular. The bar lacked warmth from the design to the staff, we wanted to sign off the bill but had to ask for a pen three times trivial yes but annoying!! Went to the room for a night time snack and was informed there wasn't any chicken so the limited menu just got smaller. The sandwiches were ok. The rest of the weekend we didn't really use the hotels services to be honest. Room was kept clean and tidy and the housekeeping was to a great standard. ",4,2015,01,13
226,A great bargain,This is a great hotel in the middle of Belfast.  It is a bargain for a luxury hotel.  The rooms are very large and the staff is both friendly and helpful.  This is good for a family or for business or solo travel.  Great place.  It has my highest recommendation.,5,2015,01,13
226,Nice Hotel,I stayed at the Fitzwilliam during a weekend away. The room was lovely and very spacious. We ate in the bar and the food was nice. I honestly couldn't fault the place. That said I've stayed in hotels of equal standard for half the price!,4,2015,01,13
226,Lovely hotel,"Very nicely designed hotel in the centre of Belfast. Staff are very helpful and accommodating. Rooms are a good size, the interior design is very striking and everything is clean and presentable to a very high standard. Probably the best hotel in Belfast.",4,2015,01,10
226,Top class fitzwillaiam,Had the pleasure of an overnight stay in this fantastic city centre hotel between Christmas and the new year. Fantastic just about sums it up. Room was excellent with large bathroom and lovely interior. Spotless and fresh. Breakfast the following morning was freshly cooked and delicious. All staff were polite and friendly and really no negatives...although I wouldn't want to have to drink too much from the mini bar as slightly expensive.,5,2015,01,07
226,Overnight stay and evening meal,"Hotel, staff, facilities , resturants, and rooms were first class. Beds were comfortable and staff bent over backwards to ensure we enjoyed our stay. Our evening meal was excellent in terms of menu choice, quality and speed of service",5,2015,01,07
226,PENTHOUSE!!!,"My partner treated me to a 1 nite stay on the 19th Dec for the ol Birthday. Landed at the hotel reception to be told there was good news and bad news....
Go for the bad...Your room isn't quite ready yet...
Ah no probs, we are off out for lunch and shopping....
The good news Sir...
We up graded you to the Penthouse!
What can I say...Unbelievable, 2 massive bedrooms, 2 massive bathrooms, kitchen, dining area, lounge with fireplace.....
THE BEST ROOM I HAVE EVER STAYED IN

Staff were so helpful and polite throughout our stay, right down to giving me a free drink with my meal! ha ha

Will def be back....but will be checking the eurolottery before I can pay what I was quoted upon checkout as too how much it should have been!

PS, the mrs was happy, as the last person staying it was Mr Michael Buble, who requested his own xmas tree!",5,2015,01,07
226,Great Start to 2015 :-),"Had a wonderful 2 x night stay on the 1st and 2nd of January. The room was a deluxe king with a large bathroom with walk in shower and a full size double ended bath. Full height windows looking out on to the street, not overly noisy and did not disturb our sleep.  Had a lovely welcome gift on arrival, 2 x chocolate mousses and 2 x homemade shortbread biscuits, both were very tasty.  Breakfast was first class loads to choose from the continental buffet and the cooked to order menu, excellent value at ¬£12,50 a head prepaid. We never ate in the restaurant during this stay but we did have a look at the pre theatre menu, excellent value at ¬£25 for 3 courses.",5,2015,01,06
226,1ST STAY BUT NOT THE LAST!!,"me and my husband stayed here on friday 3rd jan for a short break without kids before going back to work normally i head to Donegal but fancied a change and always said id stay here if in belfast well i wasn't disappointed!
I loved here we booked a deluxe king the room was amazing it was massive with floor to celing windows looking over victoria street the bed was huge and really comfortable and the bathroom had a beautifull bath and double shower 
there was a radio tea coffee hair dryer and iron and board also robes and slippers the decor was modern and comfy i could have stayed for a week 
we went to the bar after we checked in and ate lunch the food was delicious but what made the meal was the lady serving that was what i called service i was very impressed sorry cant remember her name as she deserved a mention 
i read a review saying the reception staff just seemed like robots well defo not the case we were treated to smiles and the upmost professionalism so attentive.
well done fitzwilliam as this is now one of my fav hotels!  and i definatley will be returning 
(pizza place acroos the waydoes the best pizzas ever just cant remember the name of it but its worth a visit!)",5,2015,01,05
226,Pleasant surprise in Belfast,"We stayed at the hotel over the Christmas break and it was a pleasant surprise. We had been concerned there was no parking, but the staff took care of the car with little fuss. The staff were friendly and helpful and the room was well and interestingly decorated. Great value too.",4,2015,01,05
226,Good location but not 5 Star ,"My Wife and I booked this hotel last minute but was a hotel we had wanted to stay in for quite a while. 

Check in was very good and the Concierge looked after our car. 

Room was nice and clean but a little worn / tired in parts with the dark finish. There was a whirring mechanical noise on the 8th Floor, this was due to a generator in the Grand Opera House I was told and was 

The next morning we made our way to breakfast around 10.40am, plenty of time ahead of the 11.30am cut off listed in the guest directory. The continental buffet was more or less decimated with no intentions of refreshing it appeared. One of the few hotels offering 'table service' for the hot options and we had to find someone to take an order 30 minutes after sitting down. Quality was ok and had to go and ask the Manager for our toast 10 minutes after the arrival of the hot food. 

Staff were pleasant at all times but seemed to be under pressure and hurried. 

Overall we left disappointed. We had booked a suite in the Europa a few weeks earlier for the night and was a better experience. ",3,2015,01,04
226,New Year stay very enjoyable.,"We booked the New Year's package and also stayed an extra night.  Overall we enjoyed our stay in the Fitzwilliam and thoroughly enjoyed Belfast as well.  It was great to see that the city has progressed so well over the last few years.  Our Hotel was easy to find as we drove from Dublin and it was on our route in to the city centre.  We were early (11.30 am) so the concierge took our bags and we parked the car just down the road as the hotel parking and room were not available until 2.00pm.  I returned later with the car and the keys were taken and we never saw the car again until it was delivered outside when we were leaving.  The bags arrived just as I was closing the room door.  Room was large, comfortable and nicely decorated.  It also had two lights already switched on and there was classical music playing from the stereo  system in the room.  This was a nice touch which made us feel welcome.  The bathroom was a good size with large shower unit and separate bath and hand shower.  There was a bottle of Prosecco and gift for us.  We were on the fifth floor near the lifts and I had visions of having to ask for a change of room due to noise but we never heard a sound. The rooms must be very well insulated. The New Years eve  package was very good, the reception, meal, service, music and overall service was very good.  Eventhough the bar was packed the service was fast. The guests attending were very friendly and we had lots of conversations with guests. 
Next morning breakfast was until 1.00 pm so we ate late.  Just had continental breakfast.  There was a very good selection of fruit, cereals, cheese and bread.  The following morning we decided to have a fry for breakfast.  We ordered a small fry each and toast.  We had cereal first.  My cutlery was missing so I got some myself, which was no big deal.  We waited between 20 and 30 minutes for the fry.  I queried it with our waitress and she checked and advised that it would be 2 minutes.  It did arrive but without the toast so we said nothing.   However our tea was now cold but a new pot was brought to us immediately.  I mentioned it to the receptionist when booking out and she made a note of it on the computer and offered to get the catering manager to talk to us, which we declined.  The receptionists are very friendly and efficient and make you feel welcome.  The reception area with the gas fire and lovely comfortable seating makes the whole hotel fee welcoming and comfortable.  
The concierge delivered our car and enquired whether we needed directions.  We were going to the Banbridge Town Retail Outlet and he gave us explicit instructions.  This made our journey easier.  Despite the breakfast problem the whole stay was very good and we will stay there again and probably book in for the New Years Eve package.  I will recommend the Fitzwiliam  to friends.",5,2015,01,04
226,Lacks wow factor,"Stayed here for 3 nights over new year with my friend (separate rooms) so spent considerable money in hotel - I thought it lacked character, personality and warmth... with spending so much money I just expected a little extra that didn't happen.

What's good?

Rooms are very clean, beds are comfortable, girls on reception and concierge are helpful and pleasant

Valet parking is reasonably priced during week ¬£15 a night but still think its crazy that so many top hotels in Belfast don't have free parking

What's great?

Breakfast was fabulous, loved the attention to detail eg fruit sooo fresh and lots of choices
Location is good

Needs improving?

Lights!!! The rooms are dark and dull! I don't understand these hotels that keep rooms so dark... it was impossible to see to do make-up and during day the grey voiles hanging down and poor like keep the rooms dark and dull

Restaurant - Service was terrible, soooo slow and unprofessional, I hate when you have to keep trying to get the servers attention, you don't expect this of a hotel at this level, we had the bottle of wine plonked on the table - not opened nothing just banged down - it actually made me burst out laughing it seemed so silly, food was bland and nothing special I wouldn't recommend the restaurant

Bar

Could do with some investment up the top end some rocky tables shoved together and in the middle these little tables for children that u would have to haunch down to get on to lol

Service was better here than restaurant but food was basic - ordered chicken sandwich that looked like it was bought and served from asda budget range lol

Character & Warmth

Totally lacking! It's like its needs one big warm personality to pull the whole place together, get the staff smiling and start being friendly and welcoming to people 

I wouldn't pay the same price again as I've stayed in so many Belfast hotels that are much cheaper and give the wow and warmth factor that Fitzwilliam lacks",4,2015,01,04
226,Very Underwhelming,"Stayed in the Fitzwilliam yesterday as a birthday treat for my girlfriend. We are Belfast locals and knew what to expect from staying in the city centre, although from the reputation the Fitzwilliam holds I had expected much more than what I experienced. 

I arrived and went to check in, leaving my car keys with the concierge to park in the hotel car park. The service at the check in desk was a strange experience as most hotels usually greet you and inform you off the ''usuals"" such as breakfast times, were the restaurant and bar are located and typically offer to book you in for dinner given that it was part of the package. To my surprise none of this information was passed on, the only thing I was asked for was my credit card and given my room key. 

The room was nice and I couldn't fault them as they contained all the essentials required, although I didn't feel these were on par other 5 star hotels I have been too. A nice touch was the birthday message left on the table and the complimentary 2 mini red velvet cupcakes.

Our package included a 'four' course meal, which I found to be both very satisfying and tasty although I felt the experience could have been better if the waiting service was improved. We got service by a male server, it seemed to lack the basic skills of serving and we found ourselves trying to attract his attention which proved difficult to obtain a spoon for soup, a glass of coke and other basic requests. I had mentioned it was a 'four' course meal although I am still waiting on my fourth course coming as it appeared to be forgotten. We were waiting over 10 mins for our coffee and decided to just leave and go to our room and make our own.

Breakfast was included, which I could not begin to describe as an experience. We arrived at 10.40 for breakfast and were greeted by the manager, who informed us we were late for breakfast as it ended at 10.30 and we had take a seat to see if we could be fitted in. The couple behind us were told by reception that breakfast ended at 11am although the in-room information clearly states 11.30!! After this was resolved, we got our seat and ordered our full irish breakfast, which I must say, is one of the worst cooked breakfast I had ever eaten. Some of the food was inedible and in some cases uncuttable.

I really expected more from the hotel and feel dissappointed that my birthday treat turned out to be a little sour. The hotel holds such a high reputation and I thought I couldn't go wrong with going here and hope this experience is not experienced too often by others.",2,2015,01,03
226,"Nice place to stay, but can hear the morning rush traffic","Nice, clean, small rooms. Has everything you need. Only problem was you can hear the traffic in the morning (we were on the 5th floor). 
Lovely cocktails at the bar. The valet parking was well worth it.",3,2015,01,02
226,A fabulous hotel shame about the bar staff,I stayed in the fitzwilliam as part of a large bridal party and could not fault the reception staff and the door man. The decor and the rooms were first class but after the wedding we went to the residents bar as pre arranged by the bride. I found the bar staff incredibly rude and very unhelpful. The bride in her wedding dress was asked for her key card which was embarrassing. I have never been chased out of a residents bar and the staff made every possible move to make us feel as unwelcome as possible. It was not a rowdy crowd and no other guests complained but it left a bad taste to the day being chased like cattle to bed. ,4,2015,01,02
226,Wonderful visit-100% recommend,"We had a great night of luxury in the fitzwilliam. Perfect treat for my birthday. Wonderful food, breakfast was amazing. Staff polite and attentive. Decor amazing and the rooms spotless. Had a great view over Belfast city centre and room had a CD player, mini bar, tea/coffee anything u could think of.

We were delighted and cant wait to stay again

1st class",5,2015,01,01
226,Quick visit to Belfast,"Stayed at the Fitzwilliam for 2 nights. The staff were extremely friendly and helpful, and both the food and drink was excellent. Very easy to access from the M1 if travelling from the south (5 min off the motorway), and plenty of good social activities surround it. 10 minute walk from the city centre where there's a ""world of shopping"" to be found. ",4,2015,01,01
226,Great location. Lacks ambience,"We stayed here first week-end in December. The hotel is very clean.  Breakfast was good. Although it was not buffet in the dining room (it was table service), it appeared and tasted like the buffet was in the kitchen.  We found the staff polite but not very friendly with the exception of just a few.  Gentlemen in suits (appeared to be managers) strutted at high speed, looking grim at all times and seemed to snarl instructions at staff - with never a word to the customers and definitely not a smile. The bar service was exceptionally slow.  On the two nights we stayed, there appeared to be about nine staff in the bar with no guidance or leadership.  The service was disjointed and haphazard.  The food was good when it eventually arrived.  It was even slow to be served a drink. The location is excellent. For that reason, I would return for another visit as I could cope with the other matters and who knows - with a bit of good staff relations management, they may even be corrected in the future.",3,2015,01,01
226,Ms Ryan,I stay here on business whenever I am in Belfast. Very professional staff - particularly the receptionists! The rooms are very clean. The decor is modern and stylish. The food in the bar is really nice - although I am not mad about the decor there. The breakfast was huge! Overall great service and lovely modern feel to the place. ,5,2014,12,30
226,Best Belfast Hotel ,"Stayed in the Fitzwilliam last night (28th December) for an after Christmas treat for my Fianc√© and Me.. Well what can I say, one of if not the best Hotel I've stayed in in Belfast, from the minute we arrived to the minute we left the Hotel everything about our stay was just perfect! We will definitely be back, our new favourite Hotel!! ",5,2014,12,29
226,AMAZING 5 STARS,"Stayed at the fitzwilliam last night on a BBD deal with my wife to celebrate our wedding anniversary . We arrived early and were given complimentary coffees while waiting , room was 1st class and warm it was a cold afternoon but the heat had been on for our arrival. There were strawberries dipped in chocolate waiting for us , what a lovely treat . Evening meal was unbelievable , food delicious , hot and served promptly , waiter service faultless . We treated ourselves to breakfast in bed WOW , delivered on time , warm and service with a smile , something you don't see to often , this hotel is OUTSTANDING",5,2014,12,29
226,Fabulous! ,"My husband and I stayed here a few months ago and everybody was as it should be, from the rooms to the food to the service.Could not find fault! We're booked in to celebrate our anniversary + new years + cannot wait!  ",5,2014,12,29
226,Very enjoyable and pleasant stay,"Booked the dinner, bed and breakfast package for saturday 27-28 December.

First time at the hotel, reception staff were very helpful and polite. Room was spacious and high quality with both bath and shower. Big comfy bed was appreciated for two tired parents catching up on some valuable sleep.

Dinner was very nice, staff were very attentive. Menu was limited with only 4 main choices. Food was well presented and tasted very nice.

Breakfast was lovely too, good mix of contential and cooked options.

Would stay again - close location for shops and theatre.",5,2014,12,29
226,Nothing special,"The hotel is in a central location and perfect for a visit to Belfast.
The rooms and bathroom is excellent. Nice decor, but goes downhill after that. 

TV system didn't always work. Old TV with poor reception. Awful view from the rooms, looking at a red brick wall of another hotel. Next to a busy street. Windows are very thin and hear a lot of noise. I thought the windows were open. Room was next to lift that made an alarm noise when opening throughout the night. So not a great sleep.

Breakfast was pathetic. Served a hot plate of dried up food. Worse breakfast I've had in a long time. Wasn't made fresh at all and felt like it had been in a oven for a week. Staff aren't very friendly either with no ""good mornings"" or ""hello"".

Could do better!",2,2014,12,29
226,Only In belfast would this happen..,"We were in Belfast visiting friends and chose to stay in the Fitzwilliam after reading reviews. At the end of the evening friend accompanied us back to the hotel from a local bar as their taxi was going to be half an hour. Once we arrived back in the reception our friends were told they had to wait outside (in the rain) for their taxi as they were not paying guests. Very rude and embarrassing for all! Having stayed in many hotels throughout the UK and Ireland, have never had this happen. ",1,2014,12,28
226,5* Hotel of pure Luxury,"Love our time at this hotel from start to finsih.

When booking i commented that we where starting our honeymoon here before flying out the next morning and that it was always my husbands birthday.

On Arrival, we were upgraded to a gorgeous suite and a lovely little note congratulating us on our wedding, Chocolate brownies and strawberries dipped in chocolate where waiting on us!

Room was amazing, clean and spacious.

Dinner as fab and even received complementary Champagne and birthday cupcakes.Waiter was very courteous! 

Breakfast in bed was perfect the next morning also.

Perfect stay!",5,2014,12,19
226,Maybe not in December,"We picked the Fitzwilliam for a night in Belfast because we knew the Dublin hotel and because the weather forecast was bad, we wanted somewhere where we could eat and drink in comfort without having to go outside. Possibly looking for a tranquil setting on the second last Friday before Christmas was a mistake. There was live music in the bar which was crowded with partygoers most of whom were well into the festive spirit. The bar staff seemed very inexperienced and were under a lot of pressure in making cocktails - we waited about 15 minutes for a drink but then left to go to the restaurant where we'd booked a table. Again, maybe we were expecting too much but we weren't overly impressed by the canteen style restaurant and again the staff seemed very inexperienced - maybe they've taken on temporary staff for December. The food was good although as it was a Christmas menu not very innovative or exciting. The setting worked much better for breakfast the next morning.
The room was OK - again probably a bit disappointing relative to other equivalently priced hotels we've stayed in. And I think this was the problem - the Fitzwilliam is significantly more expensive than other hotels in Belfast, but not significantly better. Again, perhaps it was due to the time of the year and perhaps also because it was full thanks to the Michael Buble concert that weekend.
The concierge and reception staff were lovely, helpful and friendly so I can't help thinking that there would be times when we'd be happy here, we just weren't this weekend.",3,2014,12,17
226,Relaxing night away from home,On arrival we were upgraded to a Deluxe room at no extra charge.  From the reception desk we were treated with the greatest of courtesy and friendliness.  Our room was gorgeous.  It was a corner room and we had a fantastic view over Belfast.  This was our second stay at the Fitz and I can honestly say I have no complaints at all. I'dt go back tomorrow.,5,2014,12,15
226,"Great Hotel, great location","I have been booking rooms in this hotel now for my colleagues for approximately 6 months. I chose this hotel not only for its proximity to the city centre but it's luxurious enough for my colleagues to stay for long periods and be very comfortable. the rooms are reasonable, the bathrooms modern and the beds comfortable. I have also dined here myself and the food is excellent.",4,2014,12,15
226,Amazing Hotel,"My husband and I stayed on the 10th/11th of Dec to go and see Muchael Buble, an anniversary /birthday celebration, amazing hotel with every attention to detail. On arrival to our room we had a card wishing us a happy anniversary and Christmas tree shaped shortbread with chocolate dipped strawberries. The rooms are very high standard, very comfortable bathrobes and slippers, white company toiletries supplied. Breakfast was delicious, my only complaint would be dinner which was lukewarm but the waiter was happy to replace it. Overall a wonderful hotel, I would highly recommend it.",5,2014,12,14
226,Very disapointed,Claiming to be a 5 star hotel I have never been so disapointed. Upon arrival we were hoping the hotel lived up to  the reviews on the website. However getting into the room there was bits of rubble all over the carpet then we went into the bathroom to find large lumps of plaster in the shower. To my disbelief the reception did not offer a different room or any help with the situation. To make matters worse I got into a bed covered in yellow stains. The amount of hotels I have stayed less stars than this I atleast expected to come and stay in a clean room especially when I've just paid ¬£170 to stay. Room service told us 15 minutes over the phone waited over an hour. Honestly think it's a disgrace that we weren't even offered any kind of room change or discount. I honestly would not recommend this hotel to anyone after this experience. ,2,2014,12,14
226,Good central location but lack of attention to details,"My second stay at the Fitzwilliam Hotel, just one night for business meetings. The hotel is very centrally located with some very nice restaurants at walking distance. Quick and nice check-in/out. Nice decoration and rooms are spacious. However it could be much better as several details are clearly missing the point: Good bedding but synthetic duvet, TV not working, Internet not working (or very slow and unstable).",3,2014,12,12
226,A lovely stay ,"I stayed in the Fitz last night as I was attending the Jingle Ball in the odyssey arena which I booked as a present for my boyfriends 21st birthday. On booking I left a message that It was a preset for his 21st and any complementaries would be appreciated. He was wished a happy birthday on check in but that was it.
The lady at the check in desk was a  delight and offered to book us a taxi for the evening and when we came down to go it was sitting outside.
The room it's self was lovely  it was situated on the 6th floor the bed was really big and comfortable and the room light switches were right above the bedside table which was very good. The view however was not good but we weren't concerned with a view. The edges of the bed also came out a lot farther than the mattress and were pointy and sharp and I scraped both my legs on it which was really painful. It also states that there is complementary water in the room which there was not just water you could buy from the mini bar. We did not get up for breakfast however at 16.95 I had no intention of getting any. We left our luggage with the concierge and retrieved them later in the day however they did not think to tell us we had left something in our room when they knew we were coming back for luggage they could have kept it.
Other than a few minor things this hotel was lovely and I really enjoyed my stay my only regret is that I didn't have a longer stay. ",4,2014,12,09
226,Good Hotel - spoilt by Breakfast Mayhem!,"I stayed with my wife for one night (Saturday 6th December) - on a positive note the staff on reception and concierge were fantastic, Hotel is very central and rooms to a good standard. The whole stay was however ruined by Mayhem in the Restaurant during Sunday morning breakfast, ironically the room was well staffed but having given an order to one of the suited restaurant managers he then proceeded to ""forget"" to register the order with the kitchen and after asking various staff 4 times to follow up the order (we were assured it was on the way) 40 minutes later my wife had to go and find him and challenge him hence the admission. If this was an isolated incident then we all make ""mistakes"" however I observed at least 3 other tables just in the one section of the room where we were seated where orders took 25 plus minutes to arrive - a couple seated next to us received half of their order during our 40 minute wait, the lady got her hot breakfast within minutes of ordering , the gentleman had the same experience as us and had to wait a further 25 minutes! Restaurant and Beverage Manager you need to sort this and soon, your team are letting down a potentially very good Hotel!",3,2014,12,08
226,Very Average,"Positives

Quick and efficient  check in
5 mins to bus station
Very central location
Comfortable bed
Good concierge service

Negatives

Bathroom very cold
Staff did not seem genuine, nor were they helpful
Breakfast order forgotten 
Bells really loud start at 0900
Duvet synthetic
Towels poor quality

In summary this is a hotel that does not deliver",3,2014,12,07
226,"Wonderful staff, excellent customer service","I booked the Fitzwilliam hotel for my parents for two nights (4th & 5th Dec) as a treat for their 50th wedding anniversary. I wanted somewhere central and was looking for a hotel which would be something special for them. I decided on the Fitzwilliam after reviewing the hotel website and comparing against other hotels in the area. The bedrooms looked extremely luxurious and with breakfast included in the price this hotel was better value that other central hotels in Belfast of similar star rating. My parents were travelling by bus to Belfast so the location of the Fitzwilliam couldn't have been better for them...being a mere 3 minutes walk from the Europa bus station. I booked online and in the additional comment box I mentioned it was my parents golden wedding anniversary and to 'be nice to them!'. On their arrival they were greeted by a smiling receptionist who immediately congratulated them on their special occasion. Naturally they were thrilled with this acknowledgement. They stayed in a beautiful room on the 6th floor and a dish of chocolate dipped strawberries was waiting in their room with a lovely note, again congratulating them on their anniversary. These simple gestures don't cost much, but it's that little bit extra that added so much value to my parent's stay. My parents had breakfast on both mornings and evening meal on the first evening of their stay. They said the breakfast options were plentiful and the food excellent. They enjoyed the friendliness of the staff from the reception personnel to the personnel in the dining areas. All were extremely chatty and the overall impression was that there is a strong emphasis on customer service. This along with the wonderful hotel accommodation and facilities meant a thoroughly enjoyable stay for my parents. They have stayed in other central Belfast hotels previously of similar star rating but the Fitzwilliam comes out on top. They would recommend it to their friends and based on their feedback I plan to  choose the Fitzwilliam myself for a girlie get together in 2015. ",5,2014,12,07
226,Lovely Atmosphere,We arrived during the Christmas market so the hotel was decorated beautifully for Christmas.  Staff were lovely and very helpful. Room service was very good. Breakfast was buffet or cooked to order. Overall lovely hotel.,4,2014,12,07
226,Brilliant,Beautiful hotel rooms lovely staff couldnt do enough for you would definitely recommend it to anyone. central for shopping or dining out xmas market just along the road we were over from Scotland to catch up with family will stay here again,5,2014,12,07
226,Beautiful room,"The room & bathroom were beautiful. Robes, slippers, quality toiletries. The TV didn't work however and although we reported it nothing was done to fix it. The public areas, restaurant & bar are quite trendy and the food was good. The staff were all great.",4,2014,12,06
226,Dark!,"Everything in this hotel is dark, perhaps it is a sign of my age, but the decor is dark, the lighting is low-level and low voltage so we spent our time fumbling about in the dark!  Particularly in the corridors.... Rooms are serviceable rather than luxurious.  The bar menu is limited but the food was excellent and very tasty.",3,2014,12,03
226,"A Nice Enough Establishment, but over priced","While I enjoyed my stay here I wasn't overly impressed.  The staff were pleasant but not exactly the the most friendly I have came across.  We had a mix up with the bag not being put in the room as we were told, and when I called reception they didn't answer the phone, so I nipped down in the lift and there were three staff on, just casually chatting to each other.  I was duly sent back to the room and told my bag would follow, then I felt that I had to tip the staff that brought it up.

The room was clean, warm and comfortable,though the view over the air-con in the floors below left a lot to be desired.  It had all of the usual four star amenities, tea, coffee mini bar safe, flat screen tv and a small selection of toiletries. 

The bar was overpriced and not to my taste, The evening menu looked great but as we had a meal already booked at a restaurant we didn't get to try and the extortionate price of the breakfast also put us off.   

The best thing about this hotel is its location,close to most things in the city, but over all I have had better service and been made to feel more valued in cheaper places, I just dont think that its worth paying extra for, especially when the charge for car parking and extras are added in.",4,2014,12,03
226,Fab hotel,"Lovely hotel, very stylish and  comfortable. Great foyer, comfy seats galore, good staff.
The food was nice, but not great layout of chairs etc in the restaurant- almost 'diner'-ish which I felt didn't suit the overall image of the hotel. We had a junior suite which was soooo nice. Traffic in morning a little loud as you have the corner of the building with all glass walls overlooking Victoria street, but still easily one of the nicest rooms I have ever stayed in. Good wifi, very clean. Location is good but I had to park up the street in a private Carpark, not too much of a problem and discounted for hotel patrons. Overall I'd definitely recommend this hotel- probably above the merchant hotel.",4,2014,12,03
226,Outstanding hotel in every respect,"I've been staying at the Fitzwilliam in Belfast on a bi-weekly basis for almost a year now and have to say I feel I have found my ultimate business hotel. Perfectly situated in the Belfast City Centre the hotel offers understated elegance, excellent accommodation, fine food and superb friendly service. I cannot recommend this hotel highly enough.",5,2014,12,03
226,An ok night in The Fitzwilliam Hotel,"Myself and my husband stayed here one night when we were in Belfast visiting the Titanic Belfast on Saturday. We arrived at 10am and we were told there was no parking so we could not check in until after 2pm and would have to park in the nearby car park behind the Europa Hotel at our own expense. We were not too impressed with this but went about our day anyway. We returned later that day to be told that there was now no parking available and that we should have booked it in advance - at no time had this been mentioned to us before this and my husband was livid. We explained that we had been turned away earlier and in fairness the lady on reception did sort it out for us but I cannot understand why hotels are allowed to be built if they simply do not have enough parking for residents!!?
We dropped our bags in the room which was nice and clean and the bathroom was really lovely & spotless. There was a mini bar, an iron, tea and coffee making facilities and 1 free bottle of water for us to share between the two of us (?). There was also a card saying 'Welcome Mr Rice' so I don't know if we were given the wrong room or he was in the room before us but his welcome card was still there when we checked in anyway.
We went downstairs to see if we could get something to eat in the bar but it was absolute bedlam so we left and went for a walk around town. When we returned a couple of hours later things seemed to have calmed down a bit so we ordered food but were told that the wait could be at least 40 minutes. We kept the order simple (2 burgers) and the orders actually arrived well within 20 minutes and were tasty. We had a few more drinks but we were not bowled over by the atmosphere to be honest. It was neither lively or relaxing but the staff were all very nice and friendly. Service was slow but they were busy behind the bar.
We had a good night sleep despite being over a really busy main road with cars passing, traffic lights and a clock going off in a nearly tower.
We went down for the breakfast early the following morning and we actually thought is was included in the rate we had paid for the room. We were shocked when we realised it wasn't as it made the whole thing very expensive. I had the veggie breakfast which was tasty and my husband had an Full Irish breakfast but it was a very small portion. The breakfast was definitely not worth the extra we had to pay for it. We also had to pay 17 pounds for parking so all in all a VERY, VERY expensive 1 night stay in an ok 4 star hotel. I have stayed in 5 star hotels for better value than this so over all we were disappointed. The bed was comfy though!",3,2014,12,01
226,Fitzwilliam Belfast,From the moment we checked in to the moment we left this was a wonderful experience.  In a great location the rooms are comfortable and clean and the breakfast is excellent. Situated right next door to the Belfast Opera House and within walking distance of shops and places of interest.,5,2014,12,01
226,great place to stay in belfast,"have stayed a few times in the fitzwilliam. great location, everywhere clean and large comfortable beds.close to shops and restaurants. dark hallways leading to rooms and bad lighting in the rooms but this didnt hinder our stay as lighting wasnt a high priority. quite pricy but again you get what you pay for. i did email the hotel before our visit and requested a high floor room. we got a room on the 8th floor. there are 9 floors in the hotel but no bedrooms on the top floor. all for business i think on the 9th floor.hope to return again",4,2014,11,30
226,Nice place,"Stayed for a week on business. Nice hotel with friendly staff. Breakfast fantastic! Try the 3-egg omelette with ham and cheese!

Rooms were sizable and pleasant with a good sized desk for working and a couch.

Only marked down a bit as food prices were quite high and the bells from the church across the road could be heard quite clearly through closed windows, waking me up every now and then of a morning, probably not too bad a thing though as I would have just lazed about all day in the comfy bed otherwise.",4,2014,11,30
226,Mainly good,Stayed here with my sister for one night.  Staff very friendly on arrival and concierge parked the car.  Room very clean and comfortable but  little dark maybe because of November light.  Great hi fi system and lovely to find cafetiere with proper coffee.  Very good breakfast.  Only quibble was with the bar.  After a long day shopping wanted quiet relaxing drink but instead got droning singer in the bar at 6pm.   Had to move to reception area which was crowded and cold with constant opening of door.  Overall a good experience,4,2014,11,29
226,Weekend Shopping Trip,"First visit.Loved it from start to finish.Didnt know Belfast,but hotel very easy to find.Next door to Opera House for a show & some good bars across the road.5min walk to City Hall & City centre shops.We got a lovely welcome from reception,staff & management.Had a really enjoyable atmosphere going on throughout the day.Loved decor on ground floor & bedrooms,great bath & large walk in shower.Evening meal was of high standard & breakfast was particularly good.Was just the two of us this time but going back in New Year with friends.To me, seemed like a great place for business during the week but changes vibe easily for the weekend.",5,2014,11,27
226,Fantastic Stay,"What a fabulous stay. The staff here were just wonderful- absolute 5 star service, particularly the concierge. But everyone from the kitchen to the reservations staff was just wonderful.

The concierge were just fantastic with suggestions regarding where to go, what to do, where to avoid, must sees and don't bothers. They were fabulous with our car and always ready with an umbrella for us during bad weather. They were also on point with restaurant recommendations and managed to fit us into some excellent places.

The kitchen staff were also lovely. So accommodating even making my ravenous boyfriend a sandwich, despite the fact that it wasn't on the menu.

The rooms were wonderful as well, great bathrooms- funky and exactly what we wanted for our stay.We did unfortunately have a rather rowdy next door neighbour but once we notified the hotel they were very sweet about it made sure they turned it down and then called back to ensure that we were comfortable and the noise had been reduced. What more could you ask for?",5,2014,11,27
226,"Lovely hotel, great staff","Stayed here Tuesday night, first trip to Belfast. Hotel recommended to us by a Belfast resident.
On arrival staff were friendly and helpful.Check in was efficient and speedy, our room was ready even though we arrived earlier than planned. Room was clean but had cigarette burns in the net curtain.When we told the front desk (we didnt want them to think it was us) they were apologetic and upgraded our room. Not necessary, but much appreciated.
Ate in the restaurant that evening and the food was outstanding. Staff were attentive and cheerful.
Breakfast next morning was good, my husband and i both had eggs benedict, very good .
All in all a great stay Belfast is beautiful and the people fantastic.
A special mention to Jessica on the desk for her help during our stay and going out of her way to make us feel welcome.",5,2014,11,27
226,"Sleek, comfortable, accommodating, perfect location","Two day stay mid-week and it was flawless. Everything felt very cozy and comfortable. Definitely a chill vibe to the design with the deep wood tones. The single room had plenty of space and bathroom was more than adequate. I tend to stay at modern style hotels around the world and this was up to my high-standards. Since it was off season and off week, it was a bargain!
The location is a 3-4 minute walk to City Center. The staff arranged a black cab tour for me on the first day and a taxi to take me to the airport. The hotel bar was great for pre-dinner drink.",5,2014,11,27
226,Disappointing,"Stayed here from Sunday to Monday. When we arrived the front reception staff were like robots..obviously trained well but had no individuality or personalities of their own. Everything was rehearsed and was quite uncomfortable. The room was amazing.. Spacious. Clean. Had everything. The only complaint was it was so cold and the heater was very loud that we were kept awake during the night with it on so we had to do without. We had a three course meal in the restaurant. Our waiter was brilliant. Very helpful and attentive. However our main courses were awful. The desserts were even worse..2vanilla creme brulees which actually tasted like butter!!! So disappointing, when we were leaving we weren't even asked if everything was ok with our stay! Such a pity as the hotel is lovely. Ideal location and rooms are amazing .",3,2014,11,26
226,Birthday ,Have stayed here lots of times and we just love it staff very friendly and Melissa in reception is so helpful and friendly every visit service with a smile we have eaten in bar and restaurant and food always good my family have all stayed here and last year celebrated my 40th birthday with private dining have been back lots of times since and this visit is for my birthday again we just love it thanks to all the staff and big thank you to melissa,5,2014,11,25
226,Lovely hotel,"classy hotel, lovely rooms.  Bar staff very friendly but I did find the front desk staff rather ""aloof"" which was unfortunate.  I see from previous reviews most guests did not share this opinion so maybe I just got the wrong impression!",5,2014,11,25
226,"Great Hotel , great location","Stayed at the Fitzwilliam on a Sunday saver deal to celebrate my birthday . On arrival was impressed with the speed of check in . Got to our room 809 and was pleasantly surprised by our suite , immaculately clean and a good size with a cool view of north Belfast and the Black Mountain . 
Included in our deal was a 4 course meal which was superb as was the service in the restaurant , a big shout out to Timothy who was so attentive and made the dining experience that bit more enjoyable . Lovely breakfast in the morning as well but think a complete  buffet  offering would have been better .
Thoroughly enjoyed my stay at the Fitzwilliam and as we were going to a concert at the Ulster Hall the location could not have been any better .
I gave 4 stars  and would have given 5 stars except there was a constant drone in the room from some sort of fan or generator outside the room .
All in all great hotel and will be back .",4,2014,11,25
226,Afternoon tea,"Just had a fantastic afternoon tea. Very relaxed atmosphere, friendly accommodating staff (even for patrons who don't like butter, mayonnaise, salad cream, cheese etc). The food was very tasty. The afternoon tea comprised of champagne, coffee (and refills), sandwhiches, scones, lavender shortbread, sweet selection.
A very happy customer.",5,2014,11,25
226,"Amazing hotel, heart of Belfast couldn't ask for better.","We checked in on Saturday and couldn't believe the professionalism of the staff. Our room was prebooked and everything was set. When entering the room it was spotless and everything you need to come back to after a day of shopping was there. Fresh tea and coffee and a bar and restaurant which had food and service which is second to none. We had the 3 course dinner in the restaurant with wine and honestly a massive call out to the chef for amazing taste and top presentation. 
On a final note, it is hard to find staff that clearly enjoy their job and are happy and comfortable when dealing with people. This is a shout out to Fran the top waiter at the Fitzwilliam hotel who was professional and passionate when dealing with you. Nothing was any trouble and made a point to remember us at the breakfast the next morning. He is amazing and everyone should look out for him when you stay :-)",5,2014,11,25
226,Lovely afternoon tea :),"My mum and I visited last week for afternoon tea, which we had in the bar. It was a lovely setting, very quiet and private as they have separate booths. The food was lovely, and the selection of cakes were yummy too. We washed them down with a lovely big pot of tea and a glass of bubbly each. The staff were great, sadly I didn't catch the name of the young waiter who served us but he was brilliant. We will definitely be back. :)",5,2014,11,24
226,A Belfast Oasis,"I visit Belfast once or twice a year and stay in the same hotel, that locale was sold out, and it had become over priced since I first started staying there so I have been looking for a plausible replacement- I found it- The Fitzwilliam. Centrally located, stylish with friendly and very competent personnel. I was happy when I walked into my very groovy and comfortable quarters. Go give it a whirl and try and get the corner rooms- most excellent views. ",4,2014,11,23
226,Fantastic rooms & evening meal but breakfast ripoff,just spent 2 weekend nights in this lovely well located hotel. The room was amazing with great bathroom. Including hifi which was novel & free wifi. Have good deals in evening 4 courses for ¬£55 per couple excellent vfm & lovely food. But breakfast was poor vfm ¬£16.50 each plus had to be wait to get in despite loads of tables free. Robinsons pub over road does better breakfast for ¬£8. Recommended but go somewhere else for breakfast,4,2014,11,23
226,Great hotel,Treated my sister to birthday treat-a night @ the Fitzwilliam. The staff are very welcoming. Lovely seating area in foyer. Great room with excellent bathroom. Can recommend the pre-theatre set 2 or 3 course evening meal-great value @ ¬£16.95. good location not far from public transport,4,2014,11,22
226,Afternoon Tea,"I visited the hitel yesterday with my daughter for afternoon tea - a little treat for her birthday.
On arriving, we went to reception who directed us to the bar area.  Here we were then redirected to the restaurant area on the first floor.  On arrival to the restaurant there were no staff in sight.
We did here voice,s further down the room so made our way there.
We were greeted by a very nice dark haired girl who was very pleasant.

Our afternoon tea was served in a booth like seating area - it was a lovely experience.  However I would have preferred an area where there was more going on and perhaps do a little people watching.

The Christmas trees were being decorated in several areas and to say the least the areas were a little untidy.  

We did enjoy the afternoon tea - sandwiches, scones, pastries, coffee and a glass of bubbly each.  However I amnot sure that I would rush back.  The experience lacked atmosphere.",4,2014,11,22
226,Honeymoon Finale ,"I decided to surprise my new wife with a two night stay in the Fitzwilliam following our return from Hawaii. 
We arrived at the hotel following the arduous return journey from Honolulu which took us over 30 hours in travel time, and needless to say we were shattered. Upon arrival outside the hotel, the concierge immediately assisted us with our bags and car even though we hadn't even checked in yet. The girls at the front desk were extremely helpful and considerate as we were very early for check in, but they managed to get us a room within ten minutes, which we proceeded to sleep in as soon as our weary bodies hit the bed. 
The remainder of our weekend here was as relaxing as we needed, excellent staff, superb decor and food and a fantastic bar to help us unwind before the journey home. We both found this hotel to be the perfect location to help us adjust to life post-Hawaii and we'll definitely be back. ",5,2014,11,21
226,Great location Great value,"Good sized stylish room, great bathroom with good shower & quality toiletries...good TV with selection of channels....very good location. I got what i thought was a good price ¬£100 a night more than that",4,2014,11,19
226,Amazing.,"By far the best hotel I've stayed in yet. All the staff were very pleasant 
Everything in the room I asked for was there. 
I asked for a great view of the city which I got, so I could ask my girlfriend to marry me...oh and she said yes lol
Couldn't have picked a better hotel
Will be back for sure.",5,2014,11,17
226,Fantastic stay,"Just returned from 2 night stay and had a fabulous time. Was a tad concerned as had read some negative reviews and can only say that some people must be very picky. I contacted the hotel to organise return transfers from airport and dealt with Phillip the concierge who was very helpful as was Daniel the taxi driver and would recommend using this service as very prompt and not costly at all. Check was smooth,again lovely staff. Room was spacious comfortable and clean, bathroom spotless although shower could have had more pressure. We had dinner in the restaurant the first night which was to include a bottle of wine as part of our package- the waiter said this was not the case but on checking apologised and offered us a bottle of house. ( I'm sure this would have irritated a lot of people but these things happen and apologies were given). The food was very hot and tasty although waited a long time on our mains but we were in no rush. Breakfast was average but tasty enough. Again hotel organised efficient transport for us that evening. Cocktails from bar were delicious and afternoon tea looked lovely. Check out again smooth and Daniel was there waiting to take us back to the airport. I would almost certainly stay in this hotel again if in belfast. Two minute walk to the shops and a short taxi ride to the odyssey arena.",5,2014,11,17
226,Amazing!,"Amazing hotel can't wait to go back. Treated like royalty as soon as we got through the door by the lovely staff. Gorgeous cocktails, 24 hr residents bar & the rooms are stunning. Total luxury - definitely will be returning!",5,2014,11,17
226,Very spacious rooms,"Really enjoyed are stay here. Spacious modern rooms and very large, comfortable bed. Staff always pleasant. Had to ask for a few extras from room service on arrival and they were promptly delivered. Ate in the restaurant pre theatre and would recommend the food as very tasty and nicely presented. Wine reasonable for a hotel. Would stay again and recommend to friends. Location is excellent too.",4,2014,11,16
226,Fantastic hotel,First time stay at clearly the best hotel in belfast.The staff are just amazing we have never stayed anywere else were we we made to feel so welcome from check-in to check out and everthing in between,5,2014,11,16
226,FANTASTIC!! ,The hotel was beautiful. We stayed on the 8th floor. Very clean and the staff were so friendly. Probably my favourite hotel in Belfast. The breakfast was beautiful and fresh and very efficient service. The hotel is in a perfect location for shopping and the train station and a couple of.minutes walk to the city centre. If you stay in Belfast you must stay here!! ,5,2014,11,16
226,Lovely hotel at the heart of city,"This property is located in a central location, few mins walking from the city centre if you wish to take the city tour bus..lovely views around the locality if you would like to take a stroll either. The rooms are well furnished with some great colors, has radio too to entertain you if you are not the one to cling on to TV..i enjoyed the company of the Cool FM during my stay which was great when you want to be with yourself and read or work. the facilities in the room & the bath facilities are excellent. Breakfast menu is fantastic, still remember the vegetarian hot menu...",4,2014,11,12
226,Another great stop over,"Myself and a group of friends stayed here on a Sunday night. We booked through the hotel website and booked car parking too. We arrived a little later than check in so were able to go straight to our room. As usual the room was to a good standard, very clean and perfect temperature. Great rooms, great food and a great atmosphere would come again !!",4,2014,11,12
226,"great hotel, creepy night guy....","decided to stay here for the 1st time with my friend, treating ourselves to a little shopping spree :) the girls on check in were great, very welcoming and friendly. we went out that night for a few cheeky drinks to a nearby bar, we arrived back only to find out we had misplaced our room key somewhere during the night, we went to the desk to ask for a new one and spoke to 'Killian' I think his name was. he have us a new room card and kept us talking for around 5 minutes, when we eventually prised ourselves away from him we found he had included his name and mobile number on the card that came along with our room key?? strange, but whatever, this could be the fitzwilliams way of personal customer service! though just as we were about to sleep for the night we received a phonecall from the strange killian asking was everything okay and did I need tea or anything brought to the room?! I very politely declined his offer and hung up. this guy gave me the creeps but was the only member of staff who did so, the rest of the staff were great. the bed was so comfortable and apart from the nightmares about Killian entering our room as we slept the nights sleep was a good one. Oh and the food in the restaurant area was gorg just a little pricey.",3,2014,11,11
226,Favourite hotel in Belfast.,"Definitely my favourite hotel in Belfast. Central to everything, brilliant rooms, brilliant shower, comfiest bed ever, quick room service, clean, everything you need. However, early check ins are not always available in our case, we thought that we could check in shortly before 2, but the room wasn't ready which is understandable, so we had to wait until later on when we would have been back. Other than that, had a brilliant stay and wish we could have stayed longer! ",5,2014,11,11
226,Decent nights stay,"We stayed here on a Sunday night. We booked through the hotel website and booked car parking too. We arrived a little later than check in so were able to go straight to our room. As usual the room was to a good standard, very clean and perfect temperature. I love the Fitzwilliam as you are usually guaranteed a great nights sleep as the beds are so comfortable - however we were on the 4th floor but our room was across from the lift and unfortunately you could hear the ding of the lift all evening - which was quite annoying. I love the bathrooms in the Fitzwilliam too - bath is lovely and deep. Parking is handy - although quite expensive at ¬£15 overnight ( and we had to move our car on check out at 12 ) - a nice touch was the two bottles of water waiting for us when we got into our car the next day. This hotel is perfect location as you can walk to majority of restaurants, City Hall, Victoria Square and other shops with ease. The concierge services were excellent. Staff are very attentive. Free wifi is useful in the rooms too as we were able to check out different restaurants in the area.",4,2014,11,10
226,Simply excellent,"An excellent hotel, right in the city, 2mins walk from the Europa bus link which takes you to and from Belfast city airport. Very good value, excellent service and outstanding interior design. Real rooms, with real space to spend time whether you're working or at leisure. Good food, great breakfast, great bar, great ambience and first class no nonsense service. Brilliant interiors by Project Orange too. It's a while since I've stayed anywhere this good with such great value.",5,2014,11,09
226,Awesome Stay!!,"Great location central to all downtown sightseeing!!!  Great service, wonderful food, and great bar!!  We felt bad even leaving our great stay, but so much to see in Belfast!!!  We will be back and look forward to see a thriving Belfast!!!  Great future ahead for all!",5,2014,11,05
226,Amazing!,As a first time visitor to Belfast I can't say enough great things about thus hotel. It is elegant in a warm and welcoming way! The attention to detail and courteous staff made one feel instantly at home and very safe and secure in s strange city. No request was ignored. The concierge services are without equal. Can't wait to go back. ,5,2014,11,03
226,Opulence and convenience at one location,"Beautiful accommodations in the middle of everything.  In house restaurant and separate bar serve outstanding cuisine at competitive prices.  Couldn't understand why they told us that the bottled water in the mini bar wasn't complimentary when our online reservation stated otherwise.  Our only complaint, as the room was spacious and we'll appointed, were the lights.  Your room key slides into a receptacle in the room to activate lighting.  However, since the room is completely dark upon entering it can be extremely challenging as you must feel your way around the wall and insert it by feel alone.",4,2014,11,02
226,Over priced and over rated!,"Stayed in a deluxe suite in this hotel! Wasn't overly impressed after spending that amount of money!!! There's nicer hotels in belfast than this for the price,
The decor in the rooms are not finished to a standard that is expected! Beds are very comfy but over all this was an average hotel!",3,2014,11,02
226,"Great Hotel, superb location","This hotel couldn't be better situated as there are several very good restaurants within a couple of minutes walk but numerous others a short walking distance of 10+ minutes (and the bar in the hotel makes lovely cocktails to kick-start your evening).  Robinsons & The Crown pubs (both excellent) are a short walk along the road.  The Belfast City Bus Tour collects/drops off at the corner of the hotel and this is something certainly worth doing.

Breakfast, while offering a huge selection, was disappointing on the 1st morning as 3 of the 4 cooked breakfasts ordered arrived lukewarm and we were also slightly confused why guests had to prepare their own toast for ""poached egg on toast""...it arrived both morning minus toast although the order was taken with no mention that we'd to make the toast.

The hotel rooms are lovely, really very nice, and the bathroom is fantastic. Cleaning level was first class.  

I am a very light sleeper so had requested a ""quiet"" room and was delighted to find I'd been given an upper floor room at the far end of the hall which meant I slept well (while some hotels ""note your requests"" I've found they don't always follow through so I was very happy The Fitzwilliam did).  My friend on the other hand requested a move as her room, directly opposite the lifts, was just too noisy every time the lift arrived.

The staff are extremely friendly and we'd certainly stay again.  The Fitzwilliam is a Brilliant Hotel.",5,2014,11,01
226,Birthday surprise,"I booked the fitzwilliam for my boyfriends birthday in August. It was a lovely stay. I had asked for a complementary upgrade if possible as it was a special birthday which we didn't get. However the room was still nice and they had chocolate strawberries and a slate in the room. I ordered up champagne to the room and the boy was very professional and offered to pour for us.
Beautiful modern rooms with stunning bathrooms. Loved the classical music switching on on our arrival. we will be back",4,2014,11,01
226,Very Comfortable,"Stayed here for a Van Morrison concert at the Europa.  (Van The Man was a treat.)  The Fitzwilliam was clean, modern, and the staff was very, very friendly and helpful.  Jara went above and beyond helping us with a ""lost friend"".  Centrally located in Belfast.  On our travels, we stayed at 4 different hotels - some very nice ones - our bed and linens at the Fitzwilliam were the most comfy.  Excellent shower (rain faucet) and tub for my wife's soak.  Only downside:  parking was tough, but valet made it okay!",5,2014,10,31
226,One night break!,"Stayed here with friends.....rooms were fine! Shower didnt have great water pressure.

 After our night out we returned lookin for the residence bar to find this wasnt a facility offered.

We had breakfast in the restaurant...... 2 out of 3 breakfasts were served wrong. Our teacups were served on side plates. From an establishment of this quality i would have expected higher standards!
",4,2014,10,30
226,BEST CHOICE FOR BELFAST TOURISTS,"This hotel was one of our best choices on our recent tour of Ireland.
The hotel is modern, roomy, and very clean.  Other than a sofa with a torn arm, everything in our room was first class.  The ensuite was large, well laid out.
Breakfast was excellent, with many choices of hot and cold items.  One could not ask for more.
Location is perfect, next door to the Opera House and a block from some of the most delightful pubs I've encountered.  It is also only a few blocks from the main shopping areas.  The Central train station in less than a fifteen minute walk from the hotel.
The best part of the hotel?  Declan, the concierge.  He was incredibly helpful, always with a warm smile and a laugh.  His restaurant and shopping tips were spot on;  and when our Black Taxi tour driver failed to show Declan called around to his contacts and found our missing driver.
I hope the hotel pays him handsomely for his efforts. He's the best I have met in my travels.",5,2014,10,30
226,Honeymoon with Friends,"Just returned from a week's stay at the Fitzwilliam - we were joined by 4 other couples - 2 staying 3 nites and 2 staying 5 nites.  Hotel was great, staff lovely, rooms immaculately clean.  I have no complaints but I am slightly disappointed.  Hotel was aware this was my honeymoon and how many rooms we had occupied however all we received was a typed up postcard congratulating us on our recent wedding.  I tried not to say anything but after two days felt I had to and Killian one of the night staff sent up a bottle of sparkling to us.  Last year I had my hen night in the Europa and occupied 5 rooms for 3 nights and when we arrived I was given an upgraded room and the occasion was appreciated.  If it had just been any city break I would have given this hotel an Excellent but as it was a very special occasion I feel let down.  My friendly advice is give honeymooners a bit more thought.",4,2014,10,30
226,Bit disappointed,"Very good welcome at reception.
Went to bar for a pre dinner cocktail. Bar staff terrible ! Not busy but grumpy staff.
Shower not working properly and towels not what you expect from a 5 star hotel.
For the price wont be back. Cant really beat the Europa Hotel in Belfast.",3,2014,10,30
226,Excellent service and facilities,"Stayed for a short overnight break. Everything was faultless from check in, the parking of the car, the cleanliness of the room, central location, evening meal, breakfast, courtesy and helpfulness of all the staff. Perfect.",5,2014,10,28
226,Satisfactory,"Stayed for one night in the hotel.  It's a large hotel with several floors.  Bed comfortable but room average.  Was given a disabled bathroom, having booked a standard room through a website. Was informed at reception by a helpful receptionist that one should have booked an executive room. Valet parking at 17 sterling which was unavailable by mid afternoon on top of an expensive room rate with no breakfast made this an unremarkable stay.",3,2014,10,28
226,Nice hotel let down by poor guest relations,"Booked this hotel as a birthday treat for my partner which I had made known on booking...disappointing then that he wasn't so much as wished a happy birthday by any staff member never mind a room upgrade or cake in the room as received by a very recent reviewer celebrating her birthday. Room was however nice if a little noisy, catch on the window was broken. Cocktails in the bar were only average. Breakfast was very good with a wide range of options available. Parking is expensive and is only available until checkout time which is not clearly stated when booking or checking in. Overall there are better places to stay in Belfast for the same price...would prefer to stay in a hotel which values ALL of their guests equally.",3,2014,10,27
226,Loved it!,"Stayed here for 2 nights, upon checking in we were greeted by Joey who was very pleasant, wished me a happy birthday and informed us we had been upgraded to a suite for our stay. WOW, the suite was amazing! There was a note waiting for us, again wishing me a happy birthday and with a slice of chocolate cake and strawberries - lovely touch. 
The room itself was immaculate, so so spacious, beautiful decor, windows the length of the room with a lovely view of Belfast. The shower was HUGE, a sink each, a bath, bathrobes and slippers, free wifi, comfy seating area - have to say again the decor is gorgeous.
We had breakfast both mornings, you can help yourself to the continental and also order a cooked breakfast. The evening meal was also good, Fran who served us was lovely and very helpful. I wish I had tried more of the cocktails, but they were quite expensive.
We had late check out til 2pm which was great as I didnt want to leave this place! If i had to think of any negative it would be that you have to pay for parking, in this lovely hotel it would be such a bonus to have free onsite parking. Overall a gorgeous hotel, and it is excellent customer service that they upgraded us, the beautiful suites cannot be faulted and they really made my stay really special. Thank you Fitzwilliam! I only feel it has ruined me now for other less adequate hotels.",5,2014,10,26
226,Wonderful experience,"I stayed at the Fitzwilliam while hurricane Gonzalo was passing through.  But in the room that could not be noticed, all was nice and quiet. Good bed, bathroom had the choice bath or shower..... Small remark: shower cap was missing.
Restaurant : perfect and friendly service, delicious food, worth a star ! Breakfast was complete! Desk personnel and concierge were professional and friendly, made you feel welcome.",5,2014,10,26
226,Afternoon Tea,"Had afternoon tea here with my hubby! It was lovely. Staff very helpful and attentive. The scones were delicious. So light and fluffy! Everything else was great too. From what we saw of the hotel, it looks lovely. Hopefully next time we are there we will be able to stay a night. ",5,2014,10,26
226,Afternoon tea delight,"Visited the fitzwilliam hotel Belfast for afternoon tea in September 2023 with three friends with our afternoon tea groupon. The groupon entitled us to afternoon tea for two for ¬£25. I believe the afternoon tea is normally ¬£25 each. we would not normally be prepared to pay ¬£25 per head for an afternoon tea but made the most of the offer available. We had excellent service , we ended up staying all day in the bar where the afternoon tea was served. It was a Sunday afternoon and it was very quiet. We had a booth to ourselves to sit and chat and the waitress made our friend a non alcoholic cocktail as she was pregnant. Most accommodating. This was a very memorable experience for all the right reasons. Food was excellent. Thank you",5,2014,10,25
226,25thAnniversary,Absolutely outstanding hotel..Staff are of the highest standards.. you feel really welcomed they go out of there way make your stay more then enjoyable they make you feel your special... Melanie was lovely who gives us a bottle of complementary champers.. and the bar man John was a top bloke with his service...The rooms were amazing spotless clean ..Beautiful decor..I enjoyed my stay so much were planing another stay very shortly.. Canyon recommend this hotel highly enough.. ,5,2014,10,25
226,Nice and mordern,"Very modern and stylish hotel. Nice staff and good atmosphere at the bar in the lobby. I just stayed 1 nite and can't tell much, but didn't think of negative things about this hotel. And loved the location. ",4,2014,10,25
226,Gorgeous hotel great location,"Loved this hotel, the room was really nice and the bathroom was too, very clean and well appointed. The staff were also very helpful. The breakfast was really nice and lots of choice and the bar does some yummy cocktails.",4,2014,10,25
226,Great hotel,"Had a great nite. 
Hotel was great very clean the staff were very polite and helpful. We had amazing cocktails in the bar but we didnt try the food. 
The rooms were nicely decorated and the bed was comfy. Had a great nites sleep. I would highly recommend this hotel to anyone i can not fault it.",5,2014,10,24
226,Perfect for a Romantic Break,"The Fitzwilliam is centrally located - two minutes to City Hall, Europa Hotel, Crown Saloon, Robinsons!  The staff are hard working and friendly.  The rooms look newly appointed, clean and stylish.  A very comfortable and quiet place to stay.  We missed the Ulster cooked breakfast as we thought it was not part of the deal we had booked... won't miss it next time!  Book direct through the website for the best deals.  The cost of a three night deal was very good value for money.  Not cheap but perfect for a special break.

Game of Thrones fans - can't believe I saw Kit Harington (John Snow) and his mates walk past me in the foyer!",5,2014,10,20
226,Fantastic Weekend Break,"This Hotel is fabulous, lovely decor, very comfortable, central and very convenient for shopping.  The food is great and very friendly staff, especially Anna who served us in the Restaurant at the weekend.  Would definitely return.",5,2014,10,19
226,Delightful,"I enjoyed my six night stay at the Fitzwilliam while in Belfast on business. The service from everyone I encountered was friendly and helpful.  I appreciated being able to check in before noon when I arrived early in the morning after long flights from the US.  The bed was very comfortable.  The size of the room and bathroom were spacious enough with good sized separate shower and bath tub.  Everything was clean and reasonably quiet.  I ate in the bar on three occasions.  The service was better than the food, which was adequate. Liked the hotel's location too.",4,2014,10,19
226,"Excellent location, highly recommended","This is a modern, almost 'boutique' style hotel, very pleasantly decorated, clean and very comfortable, it has a real nice 'feel' to it. Our room was ready even though we arrived too early. The staff could not be more friendly, the food in the restaurant was to a very high standard and it is superbly located in the central Belfast district. Car can be valet parked in their secure car park by reserving this in advance. Thoroughly recommended for a nice weekend stay in the city.",5,2014,10,19
226,"Great hotel, would recommend over the Europa","If you're staying in this neighborhood then you're probably looking to choose either this one or the Europa.  As it happens, I recently stayed here with my wife and son while my in-laws were at the Europa, so I got to see both.  Our room was about double the size of theirs, ditto for the bathroom.  I obviously didn't try their bed out but ours was very comfortable.  In addition, we ended up eating in both the pub (ground floor) of the Fitzwilliam and the restaurant of the Europa.  The restaurant wasn't particularly good and overpriced; the Fitzwilliam pub, while still not cheap, was pretty decent and pleasantly casual (always good when you have an 18 month-old with you).  I especially love the fact that the bar is open 24h for residents (not sure if this is standard practice in Belfast or not) - this came in very handy when I ended up getting stuck in the room with our son one night while the wife was out and really wanted a drink after she came back to relieve me.
Breakfast at the hotel was very nice - the maitre d' runs a TIGHT ship, but he was still nice to our kid so we were happy.
Very friendly staff, very accommodating.
I tend not to give 5 stars unless I was really blown away, and while I wasn't wowed by the place I was 100% satisfied and would absolutely recommend this hotel to friends or colleagues who want to stay in the city center.  I would give 4.5 stars if I could.",4,2014,10,18
226,Amazing Hotel,"I don't normally write reviews, but I feel this hotel needs credited! We arrived early in the morning and asked if we were able to check in earlier than stated which we were allowed to do, the staff asked us if we had breakfast yet and recommended a lovely caf√© down the street from the hotel called the Harlem Caf√©! The staff were more than friendly and done everything possible to make our stay special. The concierge kept our bags on our last day while we done last minute shopping.  The hotel itself was very modern, though we didn't try the food at the hotel we did hear people mentioning how good it was.  A lovely weekend!",5,2014,10,16
226,5star treatment,Myself and my boyfriend stayed in the hotel after seeing Ed Sheeran in The Odyssey. This was our second stay in the hotel & i cannot fault it in anyway. The hotel itself is stunning and all the staff are so friendly and helpful. Looking forward to our next stay in this beautiful hotel. ,5,2014,10,15
226,Great Location and helpful staff,"Stayed on a Saturday evening for a night out in Belfast with friends. Valet parking is useful as the location of the hotel makes it difficult otherwise. For pedestrian access to the centre of Belfast though this place is good. Lots of nice bars & restaurants very close by. The check-in and concierge staff were very helpful and friendly, always a sure sign of a nice place to stay. Rooms are reasonably spacious and well appointed. Even though we over looked Great Victoria Street they are well insulated from traffic noise etc at ground level. Hotel bar stays serves until very late on Saturday and was bustling. The breakfast was well up to standard with a wide range of choices available. I would certainly recommend it as a place to stay, although I think that the price was a little high and there are other good options in town if you are spending ¬£100 plus per person per night.",5,2014,10,13
226,Romantic and Luxurious stay,"The Fitzwilliam Hotel is smaller than its rival down the road, the Europa, but what this means is it feels a lot more intimate and romantic, especially when taking into account the dark and elegant tone the hotel has been set up with. Rooms are a bit on the small side, but the shower is amazing, and the beds large and soft. I would recommend this hotel to any couples staying in Belfast.",5,2014,10,12
226,Great hotel,"The hotel is centrally located with many bars and restaurants within a 5-10 minute walk.
The rooms are very nice and spacious as well as the bathroom too. It has a fridge but you cannot put your own things in! The bed was very comfortable too..!",4,2014,10,12
226,2nd visit still amazing,This is our 2nd visit to the Fitzwilliam Hotel and everything was as brilliant as our 1st visit. This hotel is a wonderfully modern and contemporary boutique hotel . The Reception Staff are extremely professional and provide a 1st class service . The rooms are clean with lovely comfortable beds and all the usual amenities you would need are provided . The jewel in the crown was  the breakfast it was wonderful. A fabulous continental selection and the hot food was excellent. Yet again a very successful visit to this hotel .,5,2014,10,11
226,"overnight stay, loved it!","The lobby of this hotel is so comfortable and welcoming firstly. We were meant by a very pleasant receptionist and we were instantly upgraded to a large deluxe room upon hearing it was my husband's 30th.  

The room was modern, classy and surrounded with light through the ceiling to floor windows the whole way around. Huge big bed and plenty of lighting for the evening. We even had some soothing classical music playing in the background as we entered.  My husband was also left a little chocolate treat and a note from the hotel manager for his birthday which we thought was a great touch. 

We didn't have the opportunity to dine in the restaurant but room service was quick and fresh. Breakfast was delicious, I would definitely recommend the hot option! 

Check out was very easy and quickly done by Joey the receptionist who was lovely to speak with!
All in all we had a great stay and would definitely return and recommend to family and friends!!",5,2014,10,09
226,Quick visit,"Lovely stay at the Fitz.  Our rooms weren't ready but the staff got us a drink and coffee complimentary while we waited.  Extremely helpful and courteous.  Very centrally located to bars, restaurants shops, etc.  They also helped arrange a private tour of city as we had missed the bus tour.  Rooms were very clean, comfortable and good size. If I am Belfast again I will certainly stay here.",4,2014,10,08
226,Great Stay in Belfast,"We were book in this hotel. Our stay was great, everyone was so nice. The concierge, front desk and wait staff were so helpful and nice. The location is great, a block from a transportation center and many good places to eat. You are walking distance from the city hall and a large fun shopping area. We thought it was a very safe clean area. We would definitely stay here again.

Business center printer was in need of attention, but the front desk was so helpful in dealing with our issue.",5,2014,10,07
226,First night of circular tour of N Ireland,"The Fitzwilliam is very central with easy pedestrian access to lots of attractions eg City Hall, Titanic etc. It's a stylish modern hotel, with welcoming reception and lounge area. Rooms are good with well fitted bathrooms and excellent beds. We only stayed one night but our group dinner for 14 people was well served and presented, no need for mass order. Breakfast offered good buffet plus fresh cooked Ulster fry up and other options . Great bread!",5,2014,10,07
226,Fantastic! ,"I stayed at the Fitwilliam recently as a surprise for my girlfriend's birthday. I let them know of the occasion and when we got into our room there were 2 brownie's with chocolate strawberries and ""Happy Birthday"" written in chocolate waiting for us, along with a card with a happy birthday message from the hotel, classy touch and a great start to our stay. We went for dinner that night and were greeted with complimentary champagne at the start and end of our dinner. I also arranged for them to bring out a cake which they did and were more than happy to help with. The food was great and the portions were perfect. The most important part, the room - probably the nicest hotel room I've stayed in personally. Very modern high rise new york apartment style rooms which were very comfortable. The bath was massive and the shower even bigger, perfect. The room was very warm at night, so we decided to try out the air conditioning which had the room at a great temperature in no time at all. Really no negatives from our stay at all and can't wait to stay again. Thank you to everyone at The Fitzwilliam for their help, compliance and providing a great experience. ",5,2014,10,07
226,Enjoyable stay at the Fitzwilliam,"I recently stayed at the Fitzwilliam Hotel in Belfast and i can say that it is one of the best hotels I have had the pleasure to stay at. The front desk had a perfect blend of expediency while at the same time making the check in process comfortable and pleasant. Room was beautiful and emaculate. The best of all however were the people: pleasant, responsive and friendly especially Joey at reception, Philip at the concierge and Robin the restaurant manager. When I go back to Belfast I WILL be staying at the Fitzwilliam.",5,2014,10,06
226,Best hotel in belfast,"My boyfriend and I have stayed at this hotel many times and have always had a lovely stay, we decided to try out a few different places lately for a change of scenery and have come to the conclusion that no hotel in belfast  compares to the fitzwilliam, we won't be making the mistake of going anywere else in future. The rooms are luxurious, tastefully decorated and spotlessly clean, the staff are very friendly and attentive, the food and drink is perfect the cocktail bar a lovely cosy  atmosphere for a nightcap, location is perfect and the worst thing about staying at this hotel is having to check out!! After a few disappointing stays in hotels in belfast I think a night in the fitzwilliam is just what we need, I'll be booking again very soon, as from my experience this hotel offers the best service and the nicest rooms in belfast.  :) ",5,2014,10,06
226,"Great Location, Rooms & Staff","I don't care for the lighting in this hotel (too dark) but that and the tiny work out room are the only things I can find at fault.

Positives for this hotel include:
- The location - easy walking distance to all in town activities and easy access to buses, trains, motorway for out of town activities.
- Rooms are adequately sized, quiet & clean.  Plenty of work space (however, U.S. AC power receptacles at desk would be nice).
- Breakfast buffet is great (plenty of fresh smoked salmon) and they brought me my double-espresso quickly.
- Comfortable lounge if you don't feel like fighting to get to the bar at the Crown Saloon (almost across the street).
- Excellent conference room (the Board Room) on top floor (7th?) with great views of the city (when the sun comes out).",4,2014,10,04
226,"Very good value, very good location","Really enjoyed the clean, modern room and very helpful and polite staff. We were allowed to check in early when we went to drop off our bags. The concierge was very helpful and quickly arranged for tours and recommendations. The great location is right next to the Europa Hotel and the bus stations, and directly across from the Crown pub. The hotel was an excellent value for the rate we paid.",4,2014,10,02
226,Recommended & didn't disappoint..,"We were recommended this hotel and it didn't disappoint. The rooms were spacious, comfy bed, superb bathroom, remote control for the men...hairdryer for the ladies! The staff were friendly and helpful from the front desk to housekeeping. The bar was fabulous, the waiting staff couldn't do enough to make sure your service was good. It was nice to go out for the evening and be able to just come back and relax in the bar. Breakfast was delicious and they were happy for you to swap things you didn't like. We would definatly stay here again.",5,2014,10,02
226,Stay here,"Our stay at the FItzwilliam was a wonderful experience from check-in to check-out. The rooms are excellently appointed and very comfortable. The staff is quite cordial and very helpful, especially the doormen. The location couldn't be better as we could walk to most restaurants and attractions. My favorite aspect was the large living room and the over-sized fireplace in the lobby. It gave the hotel a wonderfully warm atmosphere.",5,2014,10,02
226,Beware of Car Parking Charge,"Nice hotel, but please beware of car parking charges of ¬£17 per night, which are most certainly not made obvious when booking. Overall, it's a bit on the pricey side for what you get, as rooms are nice, but not wow and the gym facilities are very very basic. Didn't get breakfast as again was much better value eating out. Very friendly staff, but not unfortunately they are not enough to persuade us to go back.",3,2014,10,02
226,Enjoyable Stay,"We stayed here for 2 nights for a weekend away for my husbands birthday. We were booked into an executive double, which was spacious with a very comfy bed and a lovely bathroom.The standard of breakfast was excellent,it was very busy but was seated immediately, the quality and choice of food was very good, the only complaint was that the sausage, bacon and black pudding on the breakfast was a little dried out, but because of the sheer volume of guest this could be overlooked. The staff  and concierge were outstanding, always helpful and friendly.We did not eat in the restaurant or bar, had room service which was okay but with a few minor items missing, overall a very good stay, would recommend.",5,2014,09,30
226,Fabulous!,"A group of 12 of us stayed for a hen party and all had the best time. Staff were extremely helpful and attentive especially the ma√Ætre di of the restaurant on Saturday night, who was ultra helpful - nothing was too much trouble!! Overall it's an excellent hotel, great location and perfect for a girls weekend!! ",5,2014,09,30
226,Not a 5 star I'm afraid.,"We stayed here for one night in mid September. Upon arrival, we were warmly greeted by the reception staff. Check in was efficient and easy. The fitzwilliam offer a valet parking service at a cost of ¬£17 which was very convenient.

The hotel itself is fine, perhaps a bit badly lit but overall it was adequate.  The food in the bar was typical 'pub grub' but was very nice.

My only problem was that the hotel markets itself as a boutique 5* hotel, which it is simply not. They charge 5* prices, 177¬£ for one night. That price reflects a certain level of luxury, which was not available. In my opinion it is an average 4* establishment and should be priced and marketed as such. 

I must add any staff member I encountered were very friendly and obliging which is always a positive.

I wouldn't recommend the 
Fitzwilliam to be perfectly honest. The luxury and finesse of a top quality establishment just isn't there for me.

226,Excellent Hotel with a great location,"This was our first trip to Belfast.  The location of the hotel was fantastic.  Very central to many restaurants and attractions.  The room was very large, and was very quiet for sleeping.  We had an issue with the thermostat in the room not working properly.  A quick call to the front desk, and we had a maintenance staff member in our room to replace the thermostat.  Within 5 minutes he had everything totally fixed, it was very much appreciated.  We had breakfast at the hotel our first morning there, it was decent but nothing special.  We just grabbed quick breakfasts across the street at the Sandwich Station which was great.

There was free WiFi, which is always nice to have.  The staff were very friendly, and the front desk staff were particularly helpful.  We will be back at the Fitzwilliam for our next trip to Belfast.",5,2014,09,29
226,Afternoon Tea A Refreshing Delight,"I called in last week for afternoon tea with my mother after receiving a voucher from a friend a while ago.  We arrived at 2.30pm and were greeted with smiles and helpful staff during the length of our stay.  It was quiet due to the time of day and we were served quickly, with beautifully fresh bread and pots of tea and coffee that were replaced at no extra charge.  When we gave them the voucher, they thanked us for coming and asked if we'd like another refill before we left.  I don't like using vouchers as staff can sometimes be a bit funny but they were absolutely lovely and we would definitely be back.  Thank you for a lovely afternoon!",5,2014,09,29
226,"Good hotel, Great location",We spent 3 nights at the Fitzwilliam and found it comfortable and the staff were friendly. It's centrally located so we walked to most places that we wanted to see. We booked this hotel with points so we didn't pay the listed price which was pretty high.,4,2014,09,28
226,"A little on the dark side, but overall very good","Upon entering, the lobby is contemporary as well as comfortable with a nice fireplace. The location is close enough to walk to the city center and it is very close to The Crown Pub (one block). The front desk personnel were warm and welcoming, and my room was actually ready early. I had come in on an early morning flight from the US.

I stayed three nights at the hotel and had the continental breakfast each day which was good but not great. The restaurant had red high back chairs which were more modern than practical. The service was always friendly. The downstairs bar was very accommodating. We had three of us around a small table initially one night and members of group continued to join us till we were up to about 12; they kept adding another small table and chairs cheerfully. Little things mean a lot!

Dinner at the hotel was good but not great. I would not say it was a 4 star restaurant, but the soups were excellent!!!

The hallways and rooms of the hotel were a little too dark for my taste. The hallways especially were spooky and not functional. If you want to be ""artsy"" you need to be functional. It was hard to see room numbers, etc. The rooms were a lot of yellow and black (even the toiletries were in black plastic bottles!). This color scheme will get old after a while, but the room had a sofa and the bed was comfortable. 

Initially I could only get 4 channels on my TV. I asked the front desk on the second day if this was correct and they said ""No, you should have about 50 channels!"" and they said they would send someone to the room while I was out for the day. When I returned, I had no evidence anyone had come and the TV still had 4 channels. I investigated myself and noticed a cable wire was loose and when I reinserted it and tightened it, I did indeed get more channels. But having no one from the hotel fix it was a minus. Little things mean a lot.

I wavered between three and four stars for this hotel, but ultimately decided on four. It was more like 3.5 I guess. Good service, but not great service overall. And the darkness of the hallways was a bit daunting, but not terrible.",4,2014,09,25
226,Great Rooms,"This was our first stay in this hotel, and we would definitely return again. We were welcomed by friendly and informative front desk staff. They gave us a great first impression of Northern Ireland. The hotel room was clean and spacious and situated in a convenient location within the city. Looking forward to our next visit.",5,2014,09,25
226,Have to be the best rooms in Belfast!,"This was our third stay in the Fitzwilliam. We have stayed before in the deluxe suites (which i absolutely love) on the corner of the building looking onto Great Victoria Street. This time we chose the studio suites, which are on the top floor, and in my opinion this hotel has the best rooms in Belfast! I've stayed in several hotels in the city and this one is by far my favourite. Excellent location with great views over the city, yet the rooms are surprisingly quiet. The room was spotlessly clean and the bath has room for 2 and so does the shower! The beds are exceptionally comfortable and huge! We ordered room service for dinner which was at our door in no time. We also chose to have breakfast in our room and it really was one of the tastiest breakfasts ive had in a hotel and a good selection too. If youre looking for a real treat, book into one of these suites - you wont want to leave!",5,2014,09,21
226,Nice Hotel but..........................................,"........................it is very expensive for what you get!

Good central location in Belfast, close to lots of restaurants & attractions.

Rooms very well appointed, but not worth the charge for one night which is ¬£159 with breakfast!

They also charge you ¬£17.50 for car parking & if you arrive at say 6pm & leave at 8am you still pay full charge, yet 50 yards down the road you can park safely for 24 hours at only ¬£14.50. One would think that paying the room prices would guarantee you at least a free parking space.

Another thing was the addition of ¬£1 as a charitable donation, which I think is wrong. We donate plenty to charity & I feel to just arbitarily add it to a bill is morally wrong. They obviously feel that most customers would be too embarrassed to ask for it to be removed.

Breakfast was okay, sausages looked anaemic & service a little slow & this was with only 8-9 people in the restaurant at the time.

For an allegedly top hotel I felt a little let down, this was a special treat & I feel that we did not get value for money!

Overall the hotel is a very good one but I have stayed in much better places like the Shangri La in Kuala Lumpur or the Oriental Mandarin in Singapore for half the price & much nicer rooms & food!",3,2014,09,20
226,Another class ,"Myself and my wife spent a nite in hotel for our anniversary and had a great stay.
Hotel rooms are beautiful and state if the art furniture and decor,well kept and very clean.
The restaurant was busy an we where serves by Lauren who was so pleasant and attentive during our meal.
We look forward to our next visit and also to mention free wifi is available,yes you read correct,FREE.",5,2014,09,19
226,Overpriced - nothing to recommend it,"Through a travel agent, we had booked an executive king room at the Belfast Fitzwilliam.  We checked in and the room seemed to be small and of an odd configuration.  We went out for the evening and when we returned, we realized we had been assigned a ""handicapped room"".  It was very disappointing room;  and it appears that no thought was put into the design of this space. 
Half the space is taken up by an ""accessible bathroom"" which has no provision for toiletries, and the entire bathroom is open.  The bath towels are stored near the shower, which has no door or curtain to prevent the spray from going everywhere. There are no hooks or any way to hang clothing, such as a robe.  The shower head did not stay in place if you did not hold on to it; it turned into the bathroom and soaked everything. The floor became wet and very slippery.  After trying to use this shower, I wondered if it was a joke being played on me.  
Inside the bedroom it was similar: no luggage rack, no place to hang your clothing, just a desk, desk chair and a single wing chair.    
When I advised the front desk that the room was not acceptable, the response was that we had no cause for complaint, this was considered the executive King room as requested. (The clerk also mentioned about it being a ""Third Party Booking"", which I did not understand.  Our reservations were confirmed by our travel agent 2 - 3 months prior to our trip.)   In addition, the hotel was fully booked that night and we could not change the room until the next morning.  I did not find the front desk to be the least bit sympathetic, ...just come back and tell some one tomorrow.
We were accommodated the next day and that room was adequate, with a sofa and table, just as described in the promotional material.   One thing I did notice is that the hand towels hung beside the toilet in both bathrooms.  Another example of the poor design of these rooms.  I personally find the location of the towel rack unacceptable.

This ""handicapped room"" should only ever be used for a single person.  It is completely inappropriate for a couple.  There is no where to sit, except the bed.  It has no charm and I was extremely disappointed that we had to spend a night there. The hotel claims to be luxurious.  It is not. It has an institutional feel to it, nothing warm and inviting about the property. This experience certainly coloured my opinion of the Fitzwilliam Hotel.  I would not recommend this hotel.  It is overpriced, better accommodation is available.",3,2014,09,18
226,OMG - this was fabulous!,"I had to be in Belfast for 2 nights for work, and thought I'd treat myself to a suite at the Fitzwilliam.  All I can say is you've spoiled me now for other hotels! 
From start to finish, it was just amazing.  The staff are friendly, helpful, efficient and genuinely seem happy in their work (always a good sign, I think). The room was just gorgeous! It was large, very comfortable with great views over the city to the mountains.  It was spotlessly clean, and smelt fresh (not air freshener, but like it had had windows open).  The shower was large, powerful - very invigorating. Though the toiletries provided smelt a bit masculine - maybe that's just me! 
The bed was very comfortable, and the curtains heavy enough to block the light and ensure a great night's sleep.  
I had breakfast two mornings and the staff were willing/able to accommodate my request for hot chocolate (I don't take tea or coffee) and it was made the way I like.  There was lovely fresh bread as well as the usual croisants, pain au chocolat, etc.  Perfect start to the day!
I had dinner in the bar one of the nights - and it was perfectly cooked (roast chicken with mash). One of the best meals I've had in ages.  Again the staff were lovely, very attentive and helpful.",5,2014,09,18
226,A great stay in an excellent hotel,"Stayed at the Fitzwilliam hotel in Belfast for one night with a business client. On arrival we were both upgraded to suites on the 8th floor, which had a wet room, sitting/working area and a huge window running the whole length of the room. The panoramic views over Belfast were fantastic as the sun rose.
The choice of breakfast dishes was superb, I settled for pancakes with bacon and maple syrup.
First class stay, well done Fitzwilliam team!",5,2014,09,18
226,Very nice hotel and lounge,"Check in was perfect we were able to receive an upgrade such a treat.  We loved the setup of the room it had a small couch and coffee table -- so you both of you didn't have to sit on the bed.  We had a great rest!!!
We needed a small fast late night bite and we went to the restaurant and it had just closed the waiter said no problem I can order you a curry and you can enjoy it in the lounge.  This couldn't have worked out better very tasting and the staff was very friendly.
Ok -- the only thing was the gym/fitness area the treadmill needs an upgrade... We had to work off our all of food and beverages.....would stay again.",4,2014,09,17
226,Amazing !!,Me and my partner stayed here for his 30th Birthday . I had planned little things to surprise him such as balloons and strawberries and cream. Which I got so much help from the amazing front desk staff I cannot flaunt them for helping me and making the room look fantastic ! They made our stay worth every penny. I have stayed here so many times before and I find the staff here more welcoming and want to do more for your stay than the Europa hotel which I'm also a great vistor to but for feeling more welcome and the little things the staff do for you here are great ! I've left this review a little late as now I have forgotten the Girls name at the front desk who went out of her way to check on our stay and repeated asked was there anything else she could do . Some people might find that annoying but to know she's doing her job and actually wanting to help was great ! A trip here for Xmas shopping will be a must ! Can't wait to vist this hotel again ! Thank you to the staff again as for everything else the rooms and decor ! Your mad not to enjoy the lime green and black theme they have going on . FAB,5,2014,09,17
226,More a 4* hotel than a 5*,"Although we only stayed one night for dinner, bed and breakfast we seen enough to warrant the title of my review. First can I say the staff were faultless. My concerns relate to the small things that were missing such as, no bath robes or slippers, only 1 small bottle of shampoo, shower gel and facecloth  to share between 2 people and no complimentary bottles  of water. The biggest concern though was the scum stain around the shower base. If we had of being staying for more than 1 night I would have asked for another room. 
Unfortunately our disappointing first impressions were confirmed when we went down to dinner. We had booked our table for 7pm. Big mistake. The restaurant opens at 5 pm to cater for the next door theatre goers who want to dine before the show. The restaurant was packed and we had to stand waiting  for 5 minutes before we were acknowledged. Then we were asked to wait another 10 minutes for a table. This could have been all overlooked if the quality of the food had been 5*. It was more 3*. I can honestly say it was the blandest food I have ever eaten. It reminded me of food I would sometimes make myself at home. My main course was chicken which consisted of 2 slabs of chicken breast sitting on top of a mound of mash potatoes surrounded by Bisto gravy with peas. I did eat it as I was hungry but my partner who got the Risotto had to leave hers after 2 spoonfuls. 
On a positive note the bed was very comfortable and the breakfast and service was what you would expect in a 5 * hotel. Was I glad we went, yes, would I go back, No.",3,2014,09,16
226,Magnificent,"We stayed 4 nights in an Executive Double Room in this magnificent, extremely modern hotel situated in Great Victoria Street in Central Belfast. We thoroughly enjoyed our stay. The room was quite large, clean, and with a very comfortable bed. On arrival the checking-in front desk staff were very cheerful and friendly, and later in our stay recommended restaurants and other interersting sites to see. Also, they arranged our bus booking for our upcoming trip to Dublin. Room service when required was prompt and with a smile.The breakfast in the hotel's restaurant area was truly amazing with loads of choices both hot and cold. Cannot recommend this hotel more highly.",5,2014,09,15
226,An enjoyable stay,"We stayed at The Fitzwilliam for our first two nights in Ireland and a lovely introduction it was. The staff here are friendly and cheerful. The concierge was particularly helpful in booking tours and providing local information. Restaurant staff also went the extra mile with attentive service.

Our room was clean and comfortable, although I was not a fan of the dark, contemporary decor. The bed was super comfortable and the bathroom well appointed. We had no view- just overlooked the rear car park. The only significant minus was the fact that we were given an interconnecting room. We did not realise the lack of soundproofing until 1 a.m. When we were woken by our neighbours who returned from a good night out and proceeded to party on with TV and loud conversation. This was not appreciated as we were very jet lagged, but we thought it was a one off so did not complain. Sadly, the same scenario was repeated the following night. On checkout I mentioned this to the receptionist who was mortified. She said they usually only allocated the connecting rooms to family groups, but there was no explanation as to why we had been given this room. She did offer us a discount if we returned in the future. 

The big pluses of this hotel are its central location and it's restaurant. Breakfast was the best we had in Ireland - cooked to order, fresh, hot and generous portions of beautifully cooked quality local produce. Dinner was also excellent - good variety and well prepared. Restaurant service was a standout. The bar looked cosy and vibrant but we did not partake.

We thought this hotel represented good value and would recommend it for its central location.",4,2014,09,15
226,A Great Stay in a Great Location,"Ive just spent 2 nights here at The Fitzwilliam in Belfast and I've been delighted with every aspect of my stay.  

The welcome from the team on reception was genuine and warm, the staff I have met around the hotel have all been polite and friendly, even the housekeeping staff you meet on the landings are friendly and greet you‚Ä¶( its it just me, I really hate to be ignored by hotel staff, so these guys get it just right). 

My room is lovely, a really good size, bright and very stylish and I have a great view of The Cave Hill (well slightly spoiled by a chimney on the the other side of the road but I'm being very picky there) The little attention to details make it feel special like the tea light and matches so you can have a candle light soak in the tub. I would have liked a robe in my room but I understand you can request one.  So ill remember that next time.

The food has been good too, I had a lovely chicken caesar salad, recommended by the restaurant manager and he wasn't wrong it was delicious.  This mornings breakfast was good too, but it was a tad expensive if you only want something small to eat.  On future trips I will have breakfast out as there a lots of great places to eat right on the doorstep of the hotel.

Overall I've been very impressed with my stay and I will look forward to a return visit.",5,2014,09,15
226,Gorgeous Hotel,Stayed the night here while we were exploring belfast and could not have found a better hotel. The rooms were great size and the bathrooms were amazing. The shower heads are simply awesome. So relaxing after a long day of Giants Causeway and sightseeing. The staff was great and I believe his name was michael who greeted us at the door. Super funny guy and extremely helpful. Thanks Fitzwilliam for a wonderful time!,5,2014,09,14
226,Posh Hotel,"Stay here for two nights in September, it is a beautiful hotel and I found it to be very posh. The room was excellent and the service was great, however, breakfast was expensive;  I paid 12 pounds for a continental breakfast. Also, the location of the hotel as amazing as it was within walking distance to everything.",4,2014,09,13
226,"Nice hotel, but not amazing! ","Positives: 

Quick check in

Location is good. 

5 min walk from bus station

Good selection of drinks and cocktails at the bar, at good prices.

Negatives: 

Air conditioning was rubbish - extremely loud and didn't really work!

The day before we left the cleaner decided to tidy my things away for me! I like to leave my jewellery, make up, hair straightners etc on the side like all girls! As all the listed are fairly expensive I don't expect them to be touched! However the cleaner decided to put all my make up away in a bag - this might not sound like a big deal but I keep my brushes separate not to ruin them. She had shoved them all together, wrapped my straightner cord around them, and all my jewellery was pushed down the back of the table!! She had also thrown away some of my jewellery boxes!!!! 

When I told reception they did not seem to care! I have also replied to the hotels review they emailed me and had no response from that! 

The hotel is quite run down - especially the rooms! The bathroom tiles were coming off the wall, the handle was loose and the bottom of the shower was worn away! The shower was also not very powerful. 

The rooms look nice but if you look closely they are tatty! The wood is damaged in most places and it feels a little dirty! ",3,2014,09,12
226,The little things,"I stayed at the Fitzwilliam for a couple of nights, the rooms were above average, but the breakfast was just average, nice food, but when I was served my breakfast,  there were no cutlery, no serviette and no salt, "" thats not that bad"" I hear you say, no, but for the price of the hotel, you would think they would dot the i's and cross the t's

Rant over.",3,2014,09,12
226,Perfect Hotel,"I stayed at The Fitzwilliam for 3 nights. The rooms are lovely and clean and the beds are massive and very comfy. The bathroom is very spacious and the shower is great. Staff are very friendly and helpful. The cocktails are amazing! The hotel location is spot on, its a 5 minute walk to the city centre, and there are lots of restraunts and bars in the area. I would definitely recommend this hotel and will be back.",5,2014,09,10
226,Disappointing,"No chocolates in the room or bath robe and slippers... Isn't it the minimum for a 5star hotel?
It wasn't that clean neither and their was a hole in my towel and In the bed sheet, I also had to asked twice to have the baby crib brought up. I was almost charged twice for my stay of 2 nights but otherwise the staff were friendly.
I expected free parking for 245e a night but no, you have to paid 17¬£ for limited parking or go across the road at still 12¬£
The hall is very dark but cosy and the decorations and furniture are nice.
The view is mediocre but I suppose we cannot ask too much for the city center.
My room isolation was not the best, I could hear the guest next door coughing at 3am, the cars outside and the people in the hall and the elevator bell every minutes. I won't even talk about the air conditioning system which did not work great, turning off every minute then back on 30 secs later, not so great for a good night sleep.

Tv was not working at all and had to be fixed and the ""in room"" menu looked worse than a fast food menu

The thought of candle next to the bath was good but I would have expected some matches.

For finishing, there is not a night service/turn down. I wouldn't have give 5 stars, and even less the ""luxury"" appellation wish is not true",3,2014,09,08
226,fantastic location,"Excellent hotel ideally placed with helpful staff. Lovely foyer and interiors, although lighting slightly dim other than the ground floor.

226,Very good!,"My second stay at this hotel. Great service, the staff is very welcoming and friendly.

It has all you need at the level of quality you need when running on a business trip. ",4,2014,09,05
226,perfect city break,"The Fitzwilliam is ideal for a city break. It is conveniently located just around the corner from the bus station therefore easy transfer from Belfast International Airport - coaches every 15 minutes I think. Also most of the daily coach tours set off from here. Also it is easy walking distance to the shops and decent restaurants/pubs. In the hotel itself staff are friendly, nothing was too much trouble for them. Food was good, cocktails even better! I The hotel is Malmaison dark if not darker. We would not hesitate to return.",4,2014,09,04
226,Americans Delighted with The Fitzwilliam!,"We were overwhelmed with the reception staff, bellhops, and the assistance we received during our August stay in Belfast. The Fitzwilliam is such an ideal location to travel throughout Belfast. We had difficulties when we were ready to depart, but Declan and Brian went ""over the top"" to help us find alternate transportation. During our 15 days in the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland, we were in many grand hotels, but this ONE was the most helpful. By the way, the room and bathroom was lovely and very clean. Definitely recommend this hotel!",5,2014,09,03
226,Great Belfast visit.,A modern hotel in a great location. The staff are friendly and helpful. Hope to return someday!Take time to tour City Hall and make sure to go for a drink in the Crown. Also get the Concierge to book you a Causeway tour.,5,2014,09,03
226,Great hotel,Only stayed one night as on a flying trip to Belfast. Great hotel with friendly staff and good location. We arrived early and although our room wasn't quite easy we were able to leave our bags and they were taken up to our room ready for our arrival later. ,5,2014,09,03
226,Another nice stay,"Just checked out this morning ... located in a great location in city center ... i have stayed there for 2 nights and it was good as usual, rooms are clean and quiet big and the bathroom is really nice ... Breakfast was normal and limited .. Staff was friendly even they refuse to allow me for late check out :(",4,2014,09,03
226,Will Stay Again,"Great location, great room, great value and great staff. We were given 702 a corner room with floor to ceiling windows on two sides. Even on the seventh floor street noise still obvious and even in the middle of the night when the city is dead we were woken by bin collections going on down below. Restaurant lacks atmosphere and service there was friendly but not quite professional. Evening meal was good as was breakfast.These are small gripes which wouldn't prevent us staying again. Went to the Titanic Exhibition the following day which was well worth the trip.",4,2014,09,03
226,Perfect,"Very clean, modern and good location. No breakfast included but plenty of caf√©s etc nearby anyway. Very spacious bedroom and spotless. Check in was quick and efficient. Staff lovely. No complaint whatsoever. Great for a city break.",5,2014,09,01

226,Underwhelmed.,"First impression of hotel is excellent - the decor is modern and artistic in the foyer, love the fire and the seats dotted about- would like to return on a winters night for a drink!

The rooms are nicely decorated (have stayed in a deluxe room twice) and are clean, with comfortable beds.

With a 5 star hotel you would expect a personal touch - I don't feel you get this at the Fitzwilliam. For  a lot of people a stay at this hotel is a luxury, and usually for a special occasion - I don't think the staff or management acknowledge this. On my more recent stay I mentioned that it was a special occasion and the reception assured me there would be some complimentary things sent to the room. This didn't happen. I wondered if we had booked a suite instead of a deluxe room would the experience been different? The rooms are nice but that all there is, strip away the decor and its no different to a budget hotel - the treatment of guests is exactly the same.

Decent location, lovely bar food and great decor but the personal touch just isn't there.",3,2014,09,01
226,Not 5 star,"First impression of hotel foyer was pleasant.  Reception staff very helpful and checked in quickly. We paid top price for 1 night stay and expected our room to reflect that. The room was small and nicely decorated but our overpriced room looked out onto another bedroom so no view there then. Bathroom is dimly lit making it a bit depressing.  First time I ever wanted to leave a hotel and go explore the city without a rest but this room just wasn't inviting me to stay. Bed was comfy and breakfast was really good.  I don't feel five star from this hotel maybe a 3-4, I had high expectations given it's high rating but was disappointed overall.  Belfast on the other hand is a wonderful city.  ",3,2014,08,31
226,Miss,"Fantastic Hotel with a great location.  Plenty or bars and shops around.  Modern rooms, even nicer than pictured online and very clean.  Brilliant staff they were all so helpful and attentive and there was a lovely relaxed atmosphere.  I will definitely be back ASAP :) ",4,2014,08,31
226,it started so well but i need sleep,"Just home from a night in the Fitzwilliam Belfast. It all started so well, the receptionist was lovely i think her name was Joey. Got to our room and it was nice & modern. However; if you're a private person this suite was not suitable. It was all open plan so if you were having a bath or shower the person watchin tv can see you. No lock or snib on the sliding toilet door. (if you can call it a door)
The little extras in the room were great. Ie vanity kit, slippers etc.

We went for cocktails & they were delish. No faults whatsoever.
Lauren in the restaurant was great, very friendly & helpful. 
The food wasnt 'fine dining' as such but it was bistro. My prawn cocktail were shrimps not long out of freezer and tasted mainly of iceburg lettuce. The rump was lovely. Creme caramel dessert wasnt good, chef didnt taste!

So got back to our room and my experience zoomed down. There are no windows so it was hard to breath. The air conditioning was very very VERY loud. The traffic with sirens and lorries rattling going past didnt help it much. Then to top it all off the couple next door were having an almighty domestic which lasted to four in the morning. I sent my partner down to complain but  Reception didnt do or say anything about it. An almighty migraine then struck with no sleep, the room being too warm, air-con too noisey, traffic noise & my noisey aggressive neighbours! Room service then started knocking next door at 7.30. 

The breakfast was the best out of all hotels ive stayed. Breakfast to 11.30 is fantastic.

No parking on site. 

All in all, a lovely modern hotel its just not for me and i wont be back! So glad to get some sleep in my own bed tonight. ",2,2014,08,31
226,Lovely hotel,"Fab hotel where you are treated like royalty! Beautiful rooms, food is delicious staff are very nice. 
Would stay here again!
 Also I mentioned that it was my partners birthday and asked them to write Happy Birthday on his dessert but it never happened. I found it quite disappointing that this was overlooked esp when they weren't busy!",4,2014,08,31
226,Good hotel,"Great location, on-site parking if booked before-hand.  It is not one of the cheapest hotels in Belfast but you get what you pay for.  We had a lovely stay at the hotel, the bar staff were very helpful when serving.",3,2014,08,31
226,"Fantastic Hotel, highly recommend","Stayed here for one night in a deleux room.  The reception staff were lovely on checkin, very helpful and friendly.  We left our bags with the concierge, they informed us they would be in our room upon our return, which they were.  The room was fantastic, one of the best we have ever stayed in, it had everything one could need.  Our meal was part of our stay, the food and waiting staff were lovely.  We got breakfast delivered to the room, again, great presentation and taste! Overall, this is a great hotel, the staff are a credit to the establishment. Location is great also. Can't wait to return.

226,The glitchwilliam!!!,"I usually stay here when on business in Belfast & after my latest stay this will be reconsidered!!! I was in room 514 & when I got in the room it felt dirty, the dust was thick & I have taken a picture to highlight this! I then noticed a hole in my curtains, not really 5 star is it? Onto the bathroom I went to clean my teeth & low & behold I burn my hand as the hot/cold tap is on the wrong way around!!! So if u want cold water turn it to the hot side!!!!
Next I want to iron my shirt, the iron I had in my room didnt work, wires were exposed & I asked for a replacement. This was brought up & wasn't a steam iron & not fit for purpose, I asked for another which was steam & it leaked profusely so in the end I went out with a wet & creased shirt!
Cocktails in the bar up next. When paying ¬£12 for a drink (old cuban champagne cocktail was mine) you don't expect it to taste like old spice or mouthwash, rank & disgusting!!!! Thankfully, the night I had in Belfast turned my mood around, but then back to the hotel & morning comes!
Went to make a coffee & use the cafetierre, which wasn't there! Phoned reception for one & they brought up the coffee for it, not what I asked for. So they went back down & 10 minutes later reappeared with an unwashed one that had bits of coffee & water floating about in it!
Last but not least 3 times I had to go back downstairs to get my key card sorted as it wouldn't open my door!!! This was so annoying when you are on the 5th floor, but obviously just another glitch in the system & for one nights stay I've never spoken to a front desk as much in my whole time!!!",2,2014,08,30
226,First class experience,I stayed in this hotel with my husband for our wedding anniversary recently. From the second you arrive you are treated like royalty. We recieved a complementary upgrade to a superior room which was fantastic. The queen sized bed was the most comfortable bed I have every experience in a hotel. The meal we ate in the restaurant was beautiful and everyone from the concierge to the waiters offered first class service. The hotel is conveniently located in the city centre and I would highly recommended it.,5,2014,08,29
226,Amazing hotel,"We had a fantastic one night stay. From the moment we arrived every member of staff was fantastic, friendly, helpful. Special unexpected touches for my husband's birthday made it a day he will always remember.  Rooms very comfortable and spacious, food and cocktails faultless. Thank you Everyone at the Fitzwilliam. Can't wait to return!",5,2014,08,28
226,Really beautiful hotel,"We stayed for one night, hotel is amazing, service was brilliant....always a smiling face on reception. The only thing that disappointed us was that our room seemed to have been adapted....sink and toilet were very low , lovely big bathroom but sink was far too low. But otherwise we couldn't have asked for more ",4,2014,08,28
226,Overnight stay.,"Overnight stay for us for a change with a lovely meal included in the Sunday deal. Food very good and service in the restaurant was great also sampled a few cocktails downstairs with the help of the mixologist behind the bar.

Valet parking for the car as there is no car park close by. Rooms are nice and well finished. Great bathroom facilities although a little dark for me. Not the traditional Ulster fry for breakfast but OK none the less.

Will stay again as it was a nice overnight for us with a great meal.",5,2014,08,27
226,Unreal!!!!,"We stayed in the fitzwilliam hotel for the 3rd time as it was our wedding anniversary we decided to go for a special room with a few extra treats...!! Boy was the room spectacular, rose petals, chocolates & bubbles. it was certainly a wknd we will never forget. The staff are so professional and welcoming we will certainly be returning couldn't recommend it high enough. We in the restaurant it was Devine. Breakfast was equally as good. ",5,2014,08,26
226,"Fantastic service, great stay","We stayed at the Fitzwilliam as we were attending a wedding in Belfast and this is where the bride and groom had suggested everybody stay, so to be honest we didn't know what to expect.
We arrived late-ish on Friday evening and were greeted by very friendly reception staff.

Checked into our room which was a great size and had very cool decoration. We needed to eat so decided on the hotel restaurant. I think we were the last ones to dine but the staff were still very friendly. The food was good and the service was great.

We had breakfast in the dining room on Saturday and had it delivered to the room on Sunday - both were great. Great selection on offer.

All in all a great stay. We will definitely stay again when we're in Belfast. Great location for everything, easy to get to as airport bus stops behind it. And even has a small but functional gym.",5,2014,08,26
226,Incredibly stylish hotel; too many mistakes though,"We've just spent two nights at the Fitzwilliam.  The hotel is fantastic - design is top notch, in all areas I saw.  

The room is great, and of good size.  The room facilities are great too.

I always try and stay in main brand hotels, which I sometimes wonder if it's a little ignorant - although sadly this hotel proved why I have that attitude.  

One thing that struck me is that the staff at the FW just didn't seem to be singing the same song.  There were no brand standards, so every member of staff had a slightly differing level of professionalism - and way of dealing with things. 

Our room keys weren't working - and although the first person telling me it was the door and not the keys, it still took three further members of staff to sort this.  A big brand hotel would have moved us to another room while they wasted just their time and not ours.

The breakfast was very tasty - but a little too ""boutique"" for our liking.  By this, I refer to something I've experienced before with boutique hotels, which is that there's so much focus on being stylish that they forget the obvious - which in this case is that breakfast just needs to fill the person eating it.  The ""full"" breakfast was a plate of one item of each of the main crowd.  I can't eat bacon (I have braces!) and black pudding & potato bread aren't really on my list of favourite items - which left me with one sausage, one egg and a mushroom for breakfast.

I don't know why the FW have done away with the way every other hotel serves breakfast, which is to let the guest choose.  The ""boutique"" way just left me feeling hungry and wasted food!

The bar was great - drinks priced as you'd expect in a four star/Belfast hotel.  There was a particularly rude member of staff in there though (FW management if you're reading, it's the guy around 35 years old with the silly pony tail!) who thought it was more appropriate to make sure he got his jobs done when he wanted than to keep the customers happy.  At midnight, with no notice, he told us to take our drinks into the lobby - as if we'd already been warned!  He forgot to bother with customer service at all which was a shame given the amount we'd spent.  The girls serving were all great though so not all bad.

Warning - to have food brought to your room costs a staggering ¬£10 tray charge!  I've never paid that, even in some of the nicest hotels in the world!

So - my advice to other travellers is that the FW looks great - and has excellent facilities.  Just don't expect to be wowed by customer service.",4,2014,08,26
226,Great Stay!!,"My Girlfriend and I stayed here on Sunday night.. We had a standard room which was lovely, modern decor, bed was comfortable, shower was great! Our friends were staying in one of the studio suites, so we got a look around it too.. Views across Belfast were amazing, decor was similar to ours but obviously with everything spread out better, very spacious! I would recommend an upgrade if you want to impress the missus.. ",5,2014,08,26
226,Comfort and luxury in one!,"Stayed here last night for one night. Didn't want to leave this morning! Beds were so comfy and black out curtains even better can even request a certain type of pillow to suit. 
Fabulous rooms very modern with everything you could need and more -
hair dryer, tv, minibar, even a hi-fi! Large list of items available from the concierge if needed. 
Staff were pleasant, checking in and out was hassle free and quick. 
Good breakfast with a variety of both hot and cold options. 
Cocktails in the bar area were lovely but a bit pricey at ¬£8 for what we got. 
All in all a great hotel in a great location and would definitely go back again.",5,2014,08,25
226,Wonderful!,"The fitzwilliam is such a beautiful and chilled out hotel with amazing & friendly staff. We stayed in room 803 which was stunning with fabulous views. We had cocktails at the bar which were amazing and the bar staff were so much fun especially the young dark haired guy, I never got his name (sorry) he also recommended we tried the food which we did and we were not disappointed. We had the burger and chips... OMG! amazing!   Our room had the most amazing bed which we found really hard to get out of the next morning. Check out is 12pm which is wonderful.
Overall.... Fabulous hotel with unbelievable staff, amazing suite and relaxed atmosphere. We will most definitely be back.
Thank you Fitzwillam for lovely stay. ",5,2014,08,25
226,Can't fault it - lovely stay!,"I first stayed here a couple of years ago - it was a lovely hotel then but I found it a bit underwhelming given the hype that was going around at the time. My main issues really centered around the room (ok but nothing special) and the staff (polite but a bit overly formal). This time we got a free upgrade to a suite (room 805) and it was fabulous! Great view - amazing bath & showers and lovely decor. The staff were also a lot more laid back this time but always very helpful, efficient & friendly. I just found it all a lot more relaxing this time round. Breakfast was also lovely & I like the fact that the cooked breakfasts are made to order rather than a buffet. Location is excellent being right beside the train/bus station & easy walking distance to shops, bars & restaurants. We used the valet parking which costs ¬£17 a night and I would advise phoning them to book it beforehand as they don't always have room if the hotel is busy. Couldn't really fault it at all & I think we will be back before Christmas!  ",5,2014,08,24
226,Beautiful hotel,"My husband and I stayed here for one night in one of the corner rooms. Lovely, modern, clean room. Enjoyed a lovely breakfast with plenty of variety. A bit pricey but a nice treat! Very good location. The staff were friendly and helpful.",4,2014,08,23
226,Good hotel ,Very clean and quiet place. Concierge very helpful. Stayed right next to the lifts which I thought would be a pain but all ok. Would stay again and central to a lot. Front desk helpful as we were looking for a place to wash our clothes. All in all ok,4,2014,08,22
226,Great central location modern and efficient,"Parking isn't easy my advice use the valet parking service not cheap but removes the stress, Very modern rooms a nice touch is that you are shown around your room where things are how things work etc.
We were heading out to a function in city hall so we decided to get a drink and a snack in the bar 530 pm on Saturday afternoon the service was slow might have been the change over of staff but it did frustrate me at the time due to the fact we had to get ready to go out. Bed was comfy and the shower was wonderful. Breakfast was good, staff were wonderful all had a sense of humour no matter the time of day,

N.b. the corridors to the rooms are very very dimly lite, it creates a wonderful atmosphere, it didn't cause me a problem but my wife did find it difficult to see, she was worried about walking into something if she was on her own. If you are poor sighted you may want to take this into consideration

Super location nice and modern with a buzz",5,2014,08,21
226,Excellent wee spot,"Stayed at the Fitzwilliam while in Belfast for a wedding. Warm and efficient welcome at reception, well appointed room, great bathrooms, robes, slippers, and all the amenities. The decor is modern, the public areas are trendy, open, and very nice, and the bar has a great cocktail list. We didn't eat there, as the hotel is so well situated for a number of good restaurants nearby, it's next door to the Grand Opera House, and a short walk away from the city centre shopping areas. A particular mention for Stephen, the concierge, for getting us a reservation at a very busy restaurant on Saturday evening, and for sorting out a hairdresser for a wedding updo (City centre ones all close Sundays). Great spot, will be back again.",5,2014,08,20
226,Fantastic hotel,"just back from this hotel and it was stunning, very modern, clean, staff were very friendly and helpful, nothing was a problem to them. room was beautiful, comfortable bed, large modern bathroom. the little touches in the room was brilliant. i fully reccommend you work your way down the cocktail menu starting with the peach bellini :)  i simply cannot fault this hotel in the slightest, we had a fantastic time.",5,2014,08,19
226,Great for business and/or pleasure,"I have stayed at the Fitzwilliam in Dublin a few times on business and I cannot fault it one bit so I was excited to see their Belfast hotel and make a comparison. It was brilliant, if not possibly better than Dublin. A very central location within walking distance to all amenities and a very helpful concierge to guide you on your way! Stunning rooms, food and drinks with helpful staff make this the perfect place to stay for business and be comfortable or for pleasure and enjoy every bit of the hotel.

I WILL be back! (hopefully for fun this time!)",5,2014,08,19
226,Fantastic Room," It's fair to say my wife and I have started in the Fitzwilliam in Belfast numerous times and each time we have been suitably impressed and this time we left with the same feeling although we have begun to notice a few things that would improve the hotel.

The hotel has availed of the same decor since opening and it would be nice to see a refresh. Although in saying this for someone staying food the first time it will be fantastic. 

This time we stayed in the deluxe suite on the seventh floor. The room is situated on the corner of the building and has large floor to ceiling windows wrapping half of the room. The view is great. 

The food in the bar maybe could do with a freshen up to. Although the food is tasty and competitively priced. 

Over all the Fitzwilliam is fantastic and the Felix rooms are the best rooms by far, but it would nice to see new decor in the rooms. Mention for the staff who are attentive and very pleasant. ",5,2014,08,18
226,Great for a romantic city break,A lovely boutique hotel.  We were really impressed by the beautiful bedrooms and gorgeous bathrooms.  Ideal location very central to Belfast and you can pick up the tour buses or a taxi from outside the Jurys Inn hotel across the road.  Also next door to the Grand Opera House and two minutes walk from the famous Crown pub.  Great breakfast and nothing was too much trouble for the staff who were all highly attentive and very friendly and helpful.  Highly recommended.,5,2014,08,17
226,Restaurant,"Had the best meal 13/08/2014 The attention to detail was second to none. The service was fantastic,the waiters were so attentive and polite. The lady Lauren greeted us in a very pleasant manner and was exceptionally professional and courteous to us. A very well run restaurant with very well organized and polite staff Cant wait to dine their again",5,2014,08,14
226,Enjoyable stay,We had a 2 night stay here.  Check-in/check-out were quick and friendly.  We were impressed by the size of the room and bathroom.  The hotel is conveniently located near the bus station and walking distance to the centre of town.  We were able to catch the hop on-hop off bus across the street as well as our day tour to the Giant's Causeway.  We didn't eat at the hotel as there were cheaper options nearby.  We would definitely stay here again.,5,2014,08,13
226,Excellent,"Well positioned within the centre of Belfast, a short walk to most places within city and a 10 minute taxi ride, even in rush hour to Belfast City Airport. 
Check in was seamless, staff were polite and efficient.
Room was lovely, spacious, all mod cons and nice touch with hair dryer, mini bar, safe, toiletries and mini bar.  Very clean also. 
Went for a drink in the bar, great service.
Concierge were top class, from parking the car (admittedly this is charged) to holding luggage and also assisting with umbrellas when the rain came on. 
Breakfast was lovely and plentiful. 
We got a reasonable rate and for the standard of accommodation, central location and great service was well worth the money. ",5,2014,08,12
226,Lovely,"Had a one night stay in the Fitzwilliam and the room was gorgeous! For only ¬£100 the room was fantastic and staff were friendly. Didn't eat in the hotel, the bar was nice but pricey, as expected though. Would stay again!",5,2014,08,11
226,Afternoon tea and overnight stay,"Weekend away with 10 friends. We started our afternoon with champagne afternoon tea which was ¬£40 per couple.  Woooooooo this was a fantastic experience.  We had a large table in a separate area of the restaurant and it was fabulous.  There was a Hugh choice of sandwiches, scones and pastries.  The pastries were amazing - salted caramel eclairs, chocolate brownies, almond slices, coffee cake and lots more and everyone agreed it really was excellent and great value.  The rooms were lovely - modern clean and comfortable.  We had a great night out and the hotel is in a brilliant location for a night out in belfast - special mention to killian for putting up with us in the residents bar.  Breakfast was good - however the restaurant was busy and we were all served at different times which wasn't great but the food made up for it.",4,2014,08,11
226,Great two night stay,"From the minute we booked into the Fitzwilliam we couldn't be happier. The conceirge bought our bags in from the car to the room, booked a couple of tours for us and gave us plenty of information on Belfast. The staff at the front desk when we checked in covered everything, even organising newspapers etc for us. The room was truly five stars - a large room with a king size bed with great pillows, a proper full size lounge to relax and unwind, and a fantastic bathroom with both a rain shower and a seperate bath with power shower. A full mini bar (yes, you have to pay for it, but was fully stocked with more than enough choices). We decided to have our drinks at the bar. Lovely area and great staff. We chose to have dinner in the restaurant on the Saturday night, and what value - we both chose the pre theatre three course option and the food was better than what we experienced in Paris - truly exceptional stay at the Fitzwilliam.",5,2014,08,10
226,Great Hotel and great location,"We chose to stay here as we had stayed in the Fitzwilliam Hotel in New York earlier this year and had enjoyed our stay there. 
Our room was very spacious and the bathroom was also very spacious with the shower and bath being separate which we liked. The complimentary soaps etc smelled really nice and the body lotion was lovely. The decor throughout is to a high standard and there is complimentary tea/coffee with a wee cafetiere to make ""proper"" coffee in! The bed was very comfortable and we slept very well with no noise from the corridor to disturb us. We didn't have a good view from our window but hey, who goes on holiday to look out of the window!
The breakfast was very tasty and there is a good choice of cooked food as well as a continental breakfast with fruits, cheeses and meat. the full Irish breakfast was delicious and kept us going all day. 
The staff are all very efficient and friendly and nothing seemed to be too much trouble for them.
We had a couple of drinks in the bar and, although the staff were wonderful, we did find it to be lacking atmosphere a bit.
Our only wee disappointment was that in New York we seemed to get a lot of ""extras"" like slippers, bottled water and chocolates on the pillow but didn't get anything like that in Belfast, however, that didn't spoil our time and we would return here if in Belfast again. There is free wifi in the hotel and its easy to use. 
The hotel is in a great area for bars, restaurants and the bus station is very close so its ideally situated to get to most attractions.",4,2014,08,10
226,Wonderful!,"My husband and I stayed here in July of 2013.  

We had a gorgeous corner room on the top floor, overlooking the down town core.  

Room:  Beautiful.  Modern.  CLEAN!  Probably one of the nicest hotels we have stayed at.  Everything was top notch, and the beds were so comfy!

Service:  Excellent.  The front desk clerk was super helpful, and so was the concierge.  Valet parking...a nice touch!

Food:  We ate at the restaurant one night.  Very well priced.  I think we had a dinner for two for 50 dollars or some such.  It included a bottle of wine, two apps, meals and dessert.  It was very good, and the service was great.  We ended up going back for breakfast, they had a huge selection of fresh, tasty food to choose from.

Location:  right in the middle of downtown, walking distance to lots!

We would definitely stay at this hotel again, and recommend it to all.",5,2014,08,09
226,Room with a view !!!,Good location ....booked a studio suite .... Very chic room .... With all the mod cons ....not to sure about the open bath arrangement ....staff friendly .... Not a cheap hotel...Difficult to park outside hotel to check in ....problem at checkin with my reservation .... But was eventually sorted out ....bar gets very busy ..and not enough seating for quests ... Overall a really nice stay .... would definitely recommend... Would stay again....,4,2014,08,09
226,Another excellent stay.,"We use the Fitzwilliam when we stay in Belfast and have never been disappointed.  Once again the staff, the food the general decor were simply excellent.  Congratulations on the HR section for getting such first class staff - it works.  In a staff of simply excellent professionals we would have a special word for Lauren in the restaurant.  Her attention to detail and professionalism were world class.",5,2014,08,09
226,"Nice hotel,great location.","We arrived at the hotel at 11.10 am and were pleasantly surprised to be checked-in to our room.Check-in was quick and friendly.Our room was nice and large ,king sized ,comfy bed and relaxing couch.The bathroom had large walk-in shower and seperate bathtub.We were at the back of the hotel so had no view,but it was nice and quiet.The hotel is at a busy junction so I would guess the rooms at the front would get road noise .The hotel is in a great location,most attractions are within walking distance and there are lots of places to eat and drink on the doorstep.We went out for breakfast at local coffee shops as it was ¬£32 for two of us two eat breakfast in the hotel....
The bus station,which is served by the airport bus is round the corner which was great.",4,2014,08,09
226,Nice Hotel,I stayed at the Fitzwilliam Hotel during the first part of my trip to Ireland.  I had taken the bus from Dublin Airport that morning and was pleasantly surprised to find that the hotel was a block away from the bus station.  I also appreciated that they were able to accommodate me with an early check in around 11:00 a.m.  The room was nice and the staff was friendly.  The hotel is close to most of the tourist locations in Belfast (about a 10-15 min walk) and is across the street from a City Sightseeing bus stop.,4,2014,08,08
226,Weekend away,"Another great hotel in belfast but a little more expensive... the rooms/ensuites are lovely  and spacious,i find with a fridge in the rooms its easy to keep water etc cool. staff are really helpful and have a warm welcoming awaitin guests!! Breakfast is order only and a little expensive but thats own personal taste.. i do like a buffet bdeakfast myself. Other than that i cant fault it :)  ",4,2014,08,07
226,Lovely atmosphere,"Great central hotel, comfortable with a really cosy and easy vibe. Staff were welcoming and pleasant.  Lovely reception area.  Great location for meeting friends in town.

Right beside great Victoria street rail station.

Cocktails are great!",4,2014,08,07
226,We Love Belfast!,"My wife and I had a great and memorable stay at Fitzwilliam hotel in Belfast. The entire staff were courteous, friendly and helpful. In fact, they went out of their way to assist us in many regards, from excellent suggestions for dining to making reservations for various tours. They are all sweet and professional. We also tried the bar and it was cosy and pleasant. The location of the hotel is also great and hard to miss.",5,2014,08,07
226,Belfast break,Lovely hotel in a great location within Belfast City centre. The decor is very modern and the rooms very comfortable. Staff very friendly and helpful. Liked the express checkout facility to save time. The disappointing aspect of this hotel was the cost of parking. It was billed as valet parking at a cost of ¬£17 per night. That cost us ¬£34 for the two nights.  Having toured and stayed in first class hotels with free parking or nominal fee throughout Ireland (North and South) for the two weeks previous we felt this was a bit expensive for the cars to be squeezed into a small back yard.,4,2014,08,07
226,Best bed in Belfast? Certainly the best breakfast in Ulster,"Great place to stay in centre of Belfast. A great city improving all the time! Hotel is well located close to all city centre attractions. Staff friendly and welcoming. Public areas attractive and well laid out. Rooms fantastic quality with super beds! Bathrooms superb. Bar is well-stocked and with good selection of snack food.
Breakfast is fantastic. All local produce. Unbelievable bacon and sausage! Don't miss this...",4,2014,08,05
226,Highly Recommended.,"Just back from a three night stay in The Fitzwilliam Hotel, Belfast.  It definitely receives a thumbs up from me.  This was both my husband and I first time in Belfast and I think this hotel helped to make it a great break away.  The Fitzwilliam Hotel, is in a great location.  The check in went without a hitch and the valet parking is a bonus, no stressful parking :-).  We had a room located on the 7th floor with a view of the city.  Usually we stay in more country style hotels and although this is definitely not a ""country style"" hotel it's fabulous.  The hotel is a trendy style hotel and on first glance in the rooms I thought the decor was a bit alternative - black white and mustard!!!  But actually the rooms are gorgeous and the shower is absolutely fab.  The hotel was super busy but at night no noise can be heard in the rooms so sleep is not a problem.  

The food in the bar is very tasty and we can recommend it enough.  Another gem in this hotel - the cocktails :-), very tasty and the bar staff are brilliant.  I would have loved to have stayed longer and if i ever go back to Belfast will definitely be staying with The Fitzwilliam again.

A special mention to Reception and particularly Jara - her restaurant recommendation was excellent.  She also was exceptionally helpful with anything and everything. :-)",5,2014,08,04
226,"Good, comfortable, modern hotel","This is a good hotel for a weekend break in Belfast. Check in was quick and friendly. The room was ready early and they gave us a quiet room as requested at time of booking. Modern decor. Hotel is centrally located.

Service in the bar was good but the bar itself is a little lacking in atmosphere.",4,2014,08,04
226,Plush and great location,"Started our 2 cities family tour of Ireland here. Chose hotel as they were offering a 3 night deal and as we needed 2 rooms it appealed. Beautiful large rooms, super king beds, very quiet no noise from other rooms. Great location we walked to the titanic museum which was fantastic ( see review) and took about 1/2hour. Had breakfast in the hotel on the morning we had a black cab tour and whilst not cheap was of a great standard. Cafe in the spires shopping centre at a fraction of the price.  Reception friendly and helpful, bar expensive but all hotel bars are. lots of shopping  plus a cinema within a 10 minute walk. Lovely meal out at Made in Belfast.",4,2014,08,03
226,"Comfortable, quiet hotel.","I would recommend the Fitzwilliam to anyone. A modern hotel with large comfortable beds in clean well equipped rooms.  We heard very little street noise or noise from hallways/adjoining rooms etc. all at a reasonable price considering it is a city centre hotel (convenient to local transport services and the Opera House), I will be using it again.",5,2014,08,02
226,Brilliant,"Stayed here for two nights as part of our ""minimoon"". Staff were friendly and helpful, rooms were spotless and the breakfasts were brilliant! Can't fault the place at all! Make sure to show your bill when paying for parking to get a slight discount!",5,2014,08,02
226,Dont be late for dinner,"My husband and I stayed here recently for our anniversary. The room was fine, staff friendly and location great but we were hoping to eat dinner in the restaurant. We arrived about 3 minutes late and after the maitre d' asked the chef we were told we were too late. We explained that we were guests at the hotel but it was a flat no! Disappointed to say the least! ",4,2014,07,30
226,Great location for city centre stay,"We stayed here for a birthday celebration and the hotel placed a birthday card and small cakes in the room on arrival which was a nice little touch, The hotel is of a high standard with very nice rooms and a great bathroom... The location of the hotel is great and only a 5min walk into the center,. there is also many good restaurants very close to the hotel.

A must for the first time visitor is a trip on the city hop on hop off tour bus.... ¬£12 for a 48 hour pass is fantastic value and you can use it like a taxi to get around.",5,2014,07,30
226,Heart of belfast,"The staff were friendly, inviting and very helpful. The bar staff were very attentive allow the food here wasn't great. The rooms are spacious and clean and the toiletries are gorgeous. This has been my 6th  stay here and I will continue to return again and again. ",5,2014,07,29
226,Nice hotel‚Ä¶Staff needs work,"Checked in Saturday afternoon.  Hotel is nice enough, very modern, very well located.  Checking in process was horrible, for a ""big city"" hotel in city center.  Located on very busy corner, main entrance is not obvious.  I pre-booked valet parking so I was expecting to see a valet or doorman, but nothing.  I choose the side street entrance.  Left car and went to front desk to check in.  Car keys are collected at front desk.  No offer of help with bags.  Returned to car (rental) and in trying to open trunk without keys, managed to set off car alarm‚Ä¶security guy stepped out on to sidewalk to see what was up‚Ä¶saw us, then he returned inside‚Ä¶still no offer of help.  I returned to front desk to get car keys‚Ä¶still no offer of help with bags.  Returned to car, shut off alarm, got our bags and went back to hotel.  Ten feet from elevator, gal behind counter finally asked ""Do you need help?""  Not now.  C'mon guys‚Ä¶you can do better then that!",3,2014,07,28
226,We shall be coming back!,"We have just returned from a long weekend break in Belfast and our stay at the Fitzwilliam Hotel was extremely enjoyable, not only is it in a great central location, with clean modern rooms, but it employs the most incredibly attentive and professional staff. Nothing is ever a problem for them and they all go the extra mile for their customers.

Food in the bar and restaurant is of a very high standard and the service is excellent. The hotel even arranged a hire car for us which was delivered to the door. It arrived later than planned and so the hotel staff arranged a discount with the car hire company on our behalf, which was greatly appreciated. Belfast is a very friendly city, but the staff in the Fitzwilliam are the friendliest of them all. We would highly recommend this hotel to anybody planning a city break in Belfast.",5,2014,07,28
226,A great experience.,"Our stay at the Fitzwilliam Hotel, Belfast, was a pleasant and enjoyable experience. 
Located 5 minutes from the city centre, and just round the corner from the Grand Opera House, The Crown Bar and Europa Hotel. About 15 minutes from the airport by taxi, and cost about ¬£9 to arrive by taxi.
The staff on the front desk were friendly and welcoming, as was the concierge. Once we checked in (early), we were directed to our room, a basic executive, which was a generous size and well decorated. The bathroom was clean and had both a bath and separate shower. The walls did seem a little thin, as we could hear the neighbours tv, or maybe they were a little hard of hearing?! Although this was only for one night, so maybe a one off.
The free wifi was excellent, we could stream tv shows without issues. We visited the bar, which was a nice atmosphere, although a little expensive!
We were welcomed to use the computer and printer to print our boarding passes for the return journey, which was fantastic, and both concierges were very helpful.
My girlfriends only comment is that the hallway is very dark.
We did not pay the full price for our stay, as we did think it was a bit steep, but got a good offer on another website.
Overall two very happy guests, we would recommend The Fitzwilliam Hotel, and provided we can find another good offer, will definitely stay here again.",5,2014,07,25
226,Wish We Could Stay Longer!,"My husband and I stayed here for one night in July, and I just wish we could have stayed longer! I'm fairly picky but I have to say - The hotel is beautiful, central, clean, modern and the staff are incredible. Reception staff were very friendly and helpful, and surprised us with an upgrade which was great news! I was stressed when i arrived in the hotel and by the time we got to our room, I was completely relaxed and looking forward to our dinner in the hotel.   I could not give the staff in the restaurant higher praise. They were attentive, friendly, courteous and professional, and the food was absolutely delicious.

Fabulous hotel, look forward to returning some weekend in the future.",5,2014,07,25
226,Central City break,"This was our second stay at this hotel as we loved it the first time! We went for Christmas shopping and markets, food and cocktails!! So central, straight off the motorway and park, valet will take your car in! Check in is quick and easy, we were given the same room as before which I thought was quiet nice, corner room with a huge bed and excellent views of the city from the ceiling to floor window! Quite spacious, yet luxurious and everything you need for a great stay! We had breakfast which is made to order and also a wide selection of fruit, cereal and breads etc. we had no problems and found the staff approachable and pleasant! Great hotel to stay in if you don't know your way around Belfast, very central and 5min walk shops, city hall. Plenty to do all around you! The decor is fab! ",4,2014,07,24
226,Perfect city break,"Romantic city break in Belfast. Staff were friendly and helpful. Room was spacious, clean and elegant. Massive kingsize bed - got this on a deal so wasn't too expensive. Just ticked all the boxes.. Location, price - everything just about right. 
Have stayed before and will definately be back!!",4,2014,07,22
226,Didn't meet expectations!,"With planning on proposing to my girlfriend I booked into the Fitzwilliam for the night after a couple of very good recommendations from friends. 

To be honest I was a little underwhelmed. Reception staff were very friendly and warm but seemed to have a hard time producing what was offered or requested. For example, on check in, we were told some complimentary gowns and other trinkets would be sent to the room immediately. Half an hour later when requesting some champagne glasses at reception, I mentioned the gowns etc hadn't arrived. Not only did they say that would be rectified right away, they offered a bucket of ice for the champagne. Lovely, I thought. 30 minutes later we had to ring reception again asking about the ice and glasses. We didn't even mention the gowns this time. They never came, only 2 pairs of slippers! Lol There must be a disconnect between reception and housekeeping staff. I am maybe being picky here but that was only because I wanted the occasion to be perfect and reviews of the Fitzwilliam were so good. I was expecting a very high standard for such a reputable establishment.

The room was very comfortable although the air conditioning was not cold enough on a rare balmy night in Belfast. We both had difficulty sleeping. A pity because the bed was glorious.

We ate in the hotel restaurant for dinner and breakfast. The staff again were friendly and helpful. Quality food with excellent service on both occasions! :)

On checking out we only mentioned the gowns because we didn't want to be accused of stealing them! Lol The staff looked embarrassed and that was actually good to see because it shows they care about the service.

Would I stay here again? Yes but I would first try other options around Belfast. 

I don't like being negative but hopefully some constructive criticism will help other lovebirds get that perfect experience that I know the Fitzwilliam can deliver! :)

",3,2014,07,22
226,Fantastic Stay,"Stayed here for three nights on 18th July, the check in was quick and we were allocated a corner room on the 7th floor so we did not hear any noise from outside traffic. The hotel is within 5 minutes walking distance from city hall (main focal point and centre of town) and it has a variety of shops and pubs/restaurants directly opposite. Our room was very modern with a good size bed, huge bath and separate shower. We did not eat in the hotel so cannot comment on the food but the staff, especially the concierge team were very helpful and even printed out our boarding passes for our return flights - nothing was too much trouble for them. I would definitely stay here again in the future.",5,2014,07,22
226,Above and beyond expectations!,"We stayed here on a trip with dinner included with my parents. And what a lovely stay we had! 
We had a wonderful warm greeting from the ladies at reception Katrina and Jessica and the concierge helped my parents to the room with their bags. 
Wonderful comfortable beds  and beautiful decor in the room!
The bar was busy but the young chap made us delicious suggestions for cocktails.
We had our dinner on the second night and it was delicious! Best we had for our whole stay. The manager (Robin?) was very attentive and all the staff so nice. We were given a great goodbye and taxi's organized for us by the fantastic reception staff who will bend over backwards for you.

All in all way above our expectations! We will be back to stay! Made to feel so welcome and well treated.",5,2014,07,22
226,adams family hotel,this is never a 5 star hotel .its so dark that it is perfect for the adams family lol do not touch the mini bar 350 for a can of juice whos having a laugh with those prices also do not move them out the mini bar you will get charge for them even if you dont drink them and put them back in i did and got charge but got refund whats the point of a mini bar if the prices are to dear to take onto.the rest of room .rooms are nice and its mostly doubles not alot of twin rooms .i would not book this again .,2,2014,07,22
226,Best city centre hotel in Belfast,"This hotel is set in the centre of belfast. easy access to rail and bus connections. Theatres and restaurants. Check in was swift and very friendly. Valet service was on hand to unload and bag was taken staright to room. Receptionist Yana?? was very friendly & it was a pleasure to be met with great service from the start. Lobby area is well decorated and would have no hesitation in sitting there all evening watching the world go by. I don't say that about to many hotel lobby's.
I loved the decor and the whole hotel had a touch of class about it which is well deserved in my opinion. Room was excellent. cannot fault it in anyway. Well done!! Bathroom was excellent as well and bed was large and comfortable. Bar area was trendy and again service excellent.
Breakfast was the best I have had for a long while. Met at the lift by restaurant manager and shown not only to table but informed of all selections available to eat. The selection was very good and the best cooked breakfast I have eaten for flavour. The service was again first class and cannot express how good it is to see great service.",5,2014,07,22
226,Poor house keeping,"Stayed at this hotel on a secret location deal. The hotel is in a great place in the city center. The hotel staff were very pleasant and processed our booking quickly. The room was modern and decorated in green and black. 
We didn't realise until late that night that the previous occupants of the room had left their glass case and a half empty bottle of coke.the bed looked lovely until we realised it was 2 beds pushed together with a distinct dent down the middle. -very disappointing. Did not feel confident that the room was cleaned properly
Room 412",3,2014,07,20
226,Enjoyable stay,"Booked 2 nights in the Fitzwilliam as a quick break for my wife and me. We thoroughly enjoyed our stay. The rooms were modern and a good size. The bed was large and very comfortable. The hotel is situated in a great location, close to many shops/restaurants. We ate in the hotel on the second night, which was very tasty, and lots to choose from. The bar staff were very friendly and made some excellent virgin cocktails for my pregnant wife. We will definitely be staying again in the future.",5,2014,07,19
226,Excellent!,"We were checked in at reception by Melissa - a lovely member of staff who made us feel very welcome. Our room was very stylish, clean and comfy. We had a few drinks in the bar in the evening time, great selection of cocktails and beers which are priced similarly to other good bars in the city. I have fallen absolutely in love with the White Company - Noir toiletries that were available in the room, gorgeous! All-in-all we had a lovely stay and can't wait to return!",5,2014,07,15
226,Aidan Hennessey - A Fantastic Hotel,"My wife and I have returned from a fabulous stay in this hotel, having returned there after a break of more than one year. The facilities and service are 5* delivered by professional staff with a friendly grace and a casualness that only those who have received great training can do. The food in the bar plus the dinning room is delicious and so tempting and we were attended to by staff who are so helpful and friendly yet not intrusive. The breakfast is now cooked to order using the highest quality of ingredients and is fabulous, it completed a great trip.The personnel at reception are extremely accommodating and helpful. The concierge was so welcoming, having recognised both my wife and I. The bedroom is beautiful, very clean and comfortable. I look forward to our return visit.",5,2014,07,15
226,A good choice for Belfast City Center,"Fitzwilliam has done a beautiful job of remodeling.  Our room was very nice - the bathroom was gorgeous!  Better still, the staff and concierge were extremely nice and accommodating.  The location was great.  The bed was pretty comfortable.  Generally, our stay was delightful.  The four stars instead of five is because of the food situation.  The restaurant is extremely pricey and since we were traveling on a budget, we opted for the more reasonably priced (and very nice looking) hotel pub on the main floor.  Imagine you are jet-lagged and hungry.  All you want to do is eat and go up to bed, and the simple food you ordered does not arrive for 45 minutes!  The pub was not crowded.  Our order was something right off the menu - nothing unusual.  They kept telling us it would be ""right up.""  I think the waitress got embarrassed or something because a different guy (very nice and apologetic) came to talk to us.  He was ""going to check"" on our food.  This went on for so long, and I was so tired, we were about to get up and leave.  We were told that the kitchen is the same one used for the restaurant, which was ""very busy"" at that time.  This excuse did not fly with us and just made me more angry.  FINALLY, our food arrived.  It was fine, but certainly not worth a 45 minute wait.  To their credit, they offered to deliver a dessert to us in our room, free of charge, which they did.  The dessert was ""meh,"" but we appreciated the effort.  Still ... not a good experience.  A shame, because barring that the hotel itself was really great.",4,2014,07,14
226,"Great city, beautiful hotel.","We stayed recently on a long over due return visit to Belfast, the hotel is well located easy to find, very functionally. We were booked in for one night but decided to stay two, the room was very well equipped and beautiful views of the city!! Can't wait to be welcomed back to this lovely hotel, ",4,2014,07,13
226,Card refused,I have just tried booking online to stay at the Fitzwilliam hotel in January 2015 & my Maestro card was refused l rang the hotel to ask the reason & was told they don't accept Maestro & as l don't have another card l would be unable to book a room at the hotel l think this is absolutely disgusting l would have been paying good money & in this economy now you would think they would welcome the custom but obviously this is not the way it is. I have stayed in hotels in Belfast before & my card & my money were always welcome. As l'm sure you can gather l will not be enquiring about this hotel again & l  wouldn't advise any one else either. SO NOT HAPPY,1,2014,07,11
226,Fantastic Hotel,"The people that worked here couldn‚Äôt do enough for you, our 2nd day arrived for breakfast 30mins late, but said they could bring a full Irish breakfast to our bedroom, or sit in the restaurant if they didn‚Äôt mind us setting up around us for lunch. Full Irish was what you would expect, white & black pudding, soda bread, and normal egg, bacon, and tomato, mushroom, sausage.
Our final evening, the concierge arranged to get us a Chinese curry, because after 9pm there are no restaurants available to sit in. So around 11pm food arrived concierge took food & plates up to our rooms.
Rooms were spacious large extra king size bed, sofa, mini bar
Concierge will arrange trips & taxi‚Äôs & advice for you, and a must do‚Äôs is the Titanic experience, Crumlin Rd gaol, & giant causeway.
As you would expect the bars are buzzy, friendly, and loads of bars have sky sports, best pubs to visit are in the Cathedral Quarter.
We booked via Expedia which worked out ¬£600 for 2 people,4 nights, and return flights.",5,2014,07,09
226,Perfect Belfast Hotel with Exceptional Concierge Team,"My family and I stayed at The Fitzwilliam Hotel in Belfast for 3-nights.  The hotel was modern, attractive, clean and the location was convenient to restaurants, pubs and sight-seeing.  

When I made the reservation, they did not have a room with 2 beds available so we booked 2 rooms (2 adults traveling with 10-year old and 12-year old).  The price of 2 rooms was still less than what we paid for 1 room in other parts of the UK.  We were so pleased at how large and well appointed the rooms were; made our stay very comfortable.  

I especially want to acknowledge the exceptional service we received from the concierge team at The Fitzwilliam.  Our 12-year had an issue with her braces during our trip.  She was in quite a lot of pain and we needed an orthodontist badly.  I tried to locate one who would fit us in but no one would make accommodations even with an emergency.  I called The Fitzwilliam prior to our arrival to Belfast and explained the situation.  While we were in transit, the concierge team (Gerard, Declan, Phillip) called nearly every orthodontist in Belfast until they found one who would do a house call at the hotel!!  They also arranged for tours, made dinner reservations, recommended things to do with the kids...  they took such good care of us!  I can't express how much we appreciated their service and attention.  Very friendly, helpful staff all the way around!",5,2014,07,07
226,Very nice hotel!,This is a very nice modern hotel. The room decor might not be to everyones taste but I found no fault in it. The staff are very helpful and accomidating and the location is brilliant. I was in a junior suite and the room and bathroom were extremely spacious. Loved this hotel!,4,2014,07,07
226,TERRIBLE EXPERIENCE,"Booked parents in for 2 nights for the 56 yrs wedding anniversary. From the initial arrival to departure this was a bad experience. Food in restaurant was cold and overpriced, the restaurant was empty and at 7.30pm was already setup for breakfast the next morning. The sound of the night club music was very off putting as well. The friendly service was the only good thing that I can say about this hotel. 
They even charged my elderly parents ¬£20 for asking to have their breakfast delivered to the room. 
The Hotel had promised to upgrade my parents as this was a special occasion but this never happened.
I will not be using this hotel again there is plenty of better 3 star Hotels in Belfast.",1,2014,07,07
226,Belfast City hotel,"Stayed for one night with extended family - check in staff very nice but overall,  Very poor value for money! ¬£130 for Room Only + parking - breakfast an additional ¬£12-17!! The fire alarm went off while we were packing to leave - no member of staff told us it was just a test. Lifts out of commission (as expected in a fire situation) but again, staff did not know if we could use them or not when they came back! Parking situation difficult & slow. In summary, while check in staff were nice, my overall sense was one of very poor value for money!",3,2014,07,06
226,Brilliant Hotel,Stayed overnight with family. Staff at check-in very friendly and welcoming. Rooms beautiful -spacious and extremely clean. Lovely cocktail bar. Fantastic cooked breakfast in lovely surroundings. Would definately recommend -best hotel I've stayed in in Belfast by far!,5,2014,07,06
226,Forgettable,"This hotel is in a great location very central close to all bars & restaurants,staff are very helpful polite can't say enough about them.
 Now as far as the hotel itself !!!!!!! There is extremely limited parking in this hotel if your lucky to get one might not be a bad thing if you don't because they will charge you ¬£17.50 a day for it so bad. 
There is no entertainment at all in the hotel at night the bar is big and cold with no atmosphere. Breakfast will set you back ¬£16.50 for a fry ¬£12.50 for a continental my god it's not great. If I was to mark this hotel out of 5 I would give it a 2 and that's only because the staff are good. Belfast itself is absolutely fantastic the people are very friendly definitely would go back but not this hotel they sure know how to take your money not good value for your hard earned cash. 

",3,2014,07,06
226,Worst experience in all of Ireland,"If you like a dark, dreary, minimal hotel this is it. Standard rooms have no tub but a whole bathroom shower, so you must remove all items in bathroom to take a shower. Even though they upgraded us to a room with a regular tub it is still an ugly hotel. Corridors are dark, furnishings are ultra modern or so someone thinks, and the food at the hotel stinks. Couldn't wait to leave!",1,2014,07,06
226,Excellent hotel - absolutely no complaints!,"I loved this hotel. The location is amazing, in central Belfast.  You can really walk to almost everything.  City Hall and the Cathedral Quarter are within 1/2 mile.  Titanic Quarter and South Belfast (Queens University, Botanic Gardens) are a bit further, maybe 1 mile.  The only cabs I took were to West Belfast  and the Zoo. I took a cab to the Titanic Quarter, but that was because I was lazy - it is only about 1 1/2 miles. And for side trips, it is only a few blocks from the train and bus stations.  The room was great. I mentioned that the tea/coffee station did not have any artificial sweetener and that I needed a few more toiletries, and they got them for me immediately.  Room service was a bit pricey, but that is to be expected. It is on the same block as the Europa hotel, from which a lot of day tours before.  I would stay here again in a heartbeat.",5,2014,07,05
226,Perfect!!,"I booked this hotel as a suprise for my boyfriend after his graduation at QUB.  Firstly, the reception staff are lovely and effecient!
The decor of the room is beautiful and very modern and spacious! However, perhaps a fridge in the room would be beneficial.
The bar is very relaxed with a great range of drinks
I had an incident of staining my trousers and had to rush into the city to get something new.  The location of the hotel meant it was only a 5minute walk to all of the shops!  Also it is surrounded my some of the best restaurants in Belfast!
Only critism was breakfast was a bit unorganised but they seemed very busy!",5,2014,07,05
226,Fantastic 2 x Night Stay,"Just wanted to say how much we enjoyed our recent stay at the Fitzwilliam.  It was everything I could ask and more.  We were over in Ireland for week at the end of June and came to Belfast for the final 2 nights of our holiday and have to say it was a fantastic end to a great holiday.  From the small tray and message for our anniversary in our room on arrival, the room was superb, had everything anyone could need during a stay,the meal we had in the restaurant was beautiful, waiters wine choice was spot on though we never managed the 2nd bottle :(. Breakfast was excellent too and to top it off on our last breakfast we got a couple of glasses of Prosecco to celebrate our anniversary.",5,2014,07,05
226,optimistic,"We stayed at the Fitzwilliam on two occasions recently.  Our first was disappointing.  We were shown to our room, which had a lovely view of the main thoroughfare of Belfast.  However, we were to discover that a number of appliances did not work.  The room was very cold and had not been heated for our arrival.
We were upgraded to another room which I can only describe as ‚Äòchique‚Äô.  There seems to be three different styles of room.  The more you pay, the ‚Äòbetter‚Äô the room/suite - or at least, that is the theory.  Our upgraded room lacked privacy and essentially it was three rooms in an ‚Äòopen plan‚Äô effect.  Admittedly it was not to my taste.  That said, the beds were comfy and the TV and refreshments tray were excellent.  However, the food in the bar/restaurant downstairs was a little disorganised.
This hotel might appeal to couples, perhaps on a one-off stay in Belfast - honeymooners etc.  But for the casual traveller, the price may prove prohibitive.  That said, I would recommend this hotel with my final criticism going to the staff, who are a little too pretentious.",4,2014,07,04
226,Really nice stay!,Stayed for one night this week as we were going to a gig in Belfast. Can highly recommend it. Service was exceptional from start to finish. Only let down was the food in the bar which wasn't great but we'll definitely be back!,4,2014,07,03
226,"Excellent Hotel , Fabulous Staff","Stayed on 26th June for my wifes Birthday . From the moment we arrived and until we departed we  experienced the most friendly and professional staff that anyone could meet . We have stayed several times before and each time it just gets better and better , cannot wait to go back to this fantastic hotel . Well done everyone .",5,2014,06,27
226,Fabulous 5* Stay,"As soon as we set foot in the hotel we were made to feel very welcome. Our room had a gorgeous contemporary feel and was spotlessly clean and was one of the best night's sleep I've had in a hotel. Breakfast was lovely and once again the staff couldn't have been more helpful. The cocktails in the bar are to die for! Definitiely felt like a 5* stay and I would highly recommend a stay here, or even a trip to the bar for a cocktail or two!",5,2014,06,27
226,Beautiful Hotel,"Beautiful hotel in ideal location. It is right beside the Belfast Opera house and only a few minutes walk from Belfast City Hall. The rooms were beautiful, very clean, friendly staff, but breakfast was not included.",5,2014,06,27
226,Beautiful Hotel,"Beautiful hotel for your stay in Belfast. Excellent location, very clean, spacious and luxurious rooms, courteous and helpful staff. Couldn't ask for a better hotel in the city. The Concierge arranged a cab tour of West Belfast, the Murals and the Peace Wall, and this was by far the highlight of our two days in Belfast. Our cab driver's name was Davy Shaw, and he was excellent -- we highly recommend requesting him if you are interested in a tour.",5,2014,06,25
226,Good stay,"One of Belfast's newer hotels. Paid ¬£95 for the night. Huge king size bed, great location close to city centre, across the road from the historic Crown Bar. Tip: if you aren't having breakfast here, go to the Bakery nearby. Great coffee and bacon. ",5,2014,06,24
226,Brilliant,"We stayed here for my partner's birthday. friends phoned and bought us a bottle of wine for the room and when we arrived the hotel had given us a complimentary upgrade to a junior suite which was very kind of them. We both agree it was the nicest hotel room we have ever been in! Very big and comfortable. All open plan with a tv area and sofa, open plan wash area with his n hers sinks and an open wet room with two sunflower shower heads. There was a sliding door separating the toilet. The view was great over belfast to the hills and we were lucky to have good weather. We just ordered room service but it was very quick to arrive and the food was lovely. The staff were very accommodating- reception phoned to check everything was to our liking and everyone was very friendly and professional. It is a little expensive but to be honest it's well reflected in the comfort and service received. We loved our stay and we are already discussing when we will be back! ",5,2014,06,23
226,Always great!,"We have stayed here a few times and our most recent visit was a good as ever.  Great location, lovely rooms and public areas but best of all is the staff who are all friendly, helpful and cannot do enough for you - the answer to ever request is 'of course we can'. Enjoyed our latest stay and will be back.",5,2014,06,22
226,Very Comfortable,"I recently stayed at this hotel for a business trip - the 2nd time I have used it.  This time around it was even batter than my first stay.  I was very warmly greeted by the receptionist who informed me that I had an complimentary room upgrade which was a pleasant surprise.  My room was, indeed, spacious, very well equipped, comfortably furnished 0although a bit dark) and quiet for a hotel, although there was a bit of street noise.  Breakfast was very good (as per my 1st visit).  Highly recommended for a short stay in Belfast as it is very comfortable and centrally located albeit a little pricey.",4,2014,06,22
226,6* WONDERFUL EXPERIENCE,"2nd time staying in this plush Hotel and excellent experience as ever.Staff funky trendy friendly vibrant each and everyone has a smile to greet you with.Bedrooms are excellent as is the huge huge double beds smothered in Egyptian Cotton.Check out the rain shower and lush pile carpets.If it's a quality hotel slap bang in the middle of my favourite City BELFAST do yourself a favour and book in.

226,great stay,"Great two days in belfast, the hotel is in a great location close to everything, breakfast was good and the the staff very friendly.
Apart from the barman who wished he was somewhere else!
I will be back great",4,2014,06,21
226,over priced,"Spent a weekend here and found it to be completely over-priced. Equivalent to 550 euro for two nights B & B and just not worth that money.

On the positives, the staff are nice and friendly.

The breakfast was fine, nothing special.  Scrambled eggs seem to have been powdered eggs.

The corridors are really dark, the bathroom is entirely black, poorly lit and there is no shelf to put anything on, the room itself is ok but also quite dark.  I was woken up the first morning by the TV from the next door room so walls are pretty thin.

The bar is soulless and completely lacking in atmosphere.

I understand the hotel doesn't have a star rating though another reviewer mentioned that it was 5 stars.  It's not though their prices are.  At best, I'd give it 3 stars.",2,2014,06,19
226,Great Conference Venue,Great conference venue located centrally in Belfast. The conference rooms were a little tight but ideal for up to 25 delegates. Staff were friendly and helpful and food was very good. Rooms were very well furnished and decorated to a high standard. Overall great hotel.,5,2014,06,17
226,OMG,"Mt wife and I were upgraded upon arrival to a studio suite, which was absolutely spectacular. (I'm guessing the upgrade was because I've stayed in Preferred Hotels before but don't really know.) We loved the huge floor-to-ceiling window, the enormous shower for two, and twin sinks, all artfully presented in the most comfortable green and black palate. The breakfast buffet was great, and the concierge was superb. We would happily return.",5,2014,06,16
226,Lovely night treated like royalty,"Just would like to thank the lovely friendly and helpful staff at the fitzwilliam hotel Belfast . My husband and I spent a night in it we were at the opera house . It's classed as a five star and that it is. The service is second to none , we would just like to thank you all for making our night special. Very satisfied customers would highly recommend",5,2014,06,15
226,Outstanding. Warm staff made it,"Stayed in studio suite with floor to ceiling views of city. Stunning room with extra large wet room and free standing bath. The staff were warm, friendly and good fun. Valet Duncan especially professional and pleasant. We ordered breakfast to the room and it was a feast of quality food. We ate in the restaurant, staff were efficient and provided a good service my only qualm was the menu and food were a bit bland. But over all a fab stay in lap of luxury.",5,2014,06,14
226,Great location,"Great location within Belfast Centre, close to bars and restaurants with easy access to the motorways.  Nice hotel, a bit dark in the corridor to the rooms but the rooms were very comfortable.  Nice bar downstairs, we had a car so used the valet service which was ¬£17 a day.  Overall was great and would stay there again.",4,2014,06,14
226,Great stay,"Stayed two nights in a junior suite. Room was a good size with fantastic views and a standalone bath and separate shower and wet room. The stereo was poor. The hotels could tune in a few good radio stations for you! 
Food in the hotel was good. Ate in the restaurant for dinner on one night and was a very good meal. Breakfast had a great selection of hot and cold foods. Room wasn't cleaned until after 6 one night which was a real disappointment and the bottles of water were not refreshed. For ¬£250 plus a night I would have expected better. The concierge staff were the heart and soul of the hotel. Great advise on where to eat and go out. The bar staff could learn from them. Would recommend and will stay again next time we are staying in Belfast. ",5,2014,06,12
226,Very convenient and friendly,This is a lovely hotel. Staff very friendly and helpful. We stayed one night last week. Check in and out very good. Lunch lovely. Staff at reception ordered a taxi for us to the cliff Richard concert. Very quick. Security very good in the hotel. I would recommend this hotel for its cleanliness  friendliness  and convenient to all the shops. ,4,2014,06,11
226,Not worth it,"Hidden fees for using any amenities are not listed and not worth it.  Got charged 10 pounds for an unlisted room service fee which seems ridiculous to me, on top of other fees.  Staff were not knowledgable regarding directions or recommendations.  Walls are pretty thin, I was woken up early on a weekend.  Rooms are nice and the location is decent, but it's not that much of a value, and the fees are horrible.",2,2014,06,07
226,Convenient modern hotel,"Spent one night in Belfast at the Fitzwilliam Hotel. The staff was friendly and helpful, especially Philip at the concierge desk. Our room was comfortable and the bath was roomy and well appointed. We ate lunch and breakfast at the hotel and the food was very good.  The Belfast hop on hop off bus stops across the street.",4,2014,06,07
226,Let Down...,"My partner booked us a night in this hotel as present for me as I'd always wanted to stay here. Well in short I won't be back!! A very basic double room, torn curtains, the window wouldn't close properly and the furniture was all chipped. Although this hotel is fairly new the room was tired and in need of some TLC. The worst thing for us was a rather unpleasant smell that came from the bathroom! Not what you would expect for the price that we paid. Breakfast was just ok, tables very close together and food took a long time to come. There are much better hotels in Belfast which won't cost anywhere near as much. ",2,2014,06,04
226,Lovely hotel ,Stayed here with one of the girls what a lovely hotel . Hotel staff really nice and very welcoming on arrival. Rooms are very modern nice and comfortable . Overall really enjoyed by stay here very good hotel . Would defiantly stay here again ..,5,2014,06,03
226,Far too modern and poorly trained staff,"While a beautiful hotel and done up very, very modern, hotel had some serious drawbacks. Before I checked in with friend, I requested two single beds. Instead I was given one with a single bed in a room that was clearly for handicapped accessible. A tiny, low sink and shower stall for person who needs to sit. (Nice that they have it, but unpleasant for us) almost no place for our toiletries. Useless for two adults.
Room was on second floor overlooking an alley so we couldn't open an window.
Room itself had no place to open one suitcase, let alone two.  Also, clearly the air conditioning wasn't working and the room remained hot and stuffy despite being told it would 'eventually' cool down by very young night manager.  This manager on duty was almost useless. Refused to help us in getting at least an adequate room. His attitude seemed to be 'tough'! Finally a tour operator intervened  and he gave us his room, though we had to have a cot put in for me since his room was for one. He didn't seem to mind, but I felt bad that my comfort was at the expense of another guest. 
I did hear other guests complain about same issues, but can't speak to that. 
Young staff were very nice, but some were far to young for their jobs.",2,2014,06,03
226,Perfect City Break,"I traveled to Belfast with my wife, for my birthday and for valentines which is also on my birthday. We had planned a tour of Ireland and felt that Belfast would be ideal to start. The hotel staff were very attentive and nothing seemed a problem or issue. The Hotel has a modern decor and is very comfortable. The rooms are well layed out with very comfortable beds. Overall a most pleasing stay.",5,2014,06,01
226,Good place to stay,"Our family took 4 rooms here for the bank holiday weekend.  We had a room with a travel cot and the parents were more than pleased with it.  All rooms were clean and more than adequate.  I would say, easily 4 stars  on an international level.  Tea and coffee facilities a lovely addition.  Bathroom washbasin could have done with more space around it for toiletries, but not a big negative for 2 to 3 night stay.  Excellent price for the room.  Common areas very clean.   Check in staff very polite and helpful and efficient.  Concierge services excellent.  Breakfast as good as any.  I would recommend this hotel highly.",5,2014,05,30
226,"Excellent Hotel,  would highly recommend","From the moment we stepped through the doors we were given excellent Service from Declan the concierge who made our stay at the Hotel very memorable with his knowledge and helpful advice.

The rooms were good sized, well equipped, clean with a large bathroom with separate bath and walk in shower. Very comfortable beds we had a good nights sleep during our stay.

The breakfast is well worth having. Location is perfect for restaurants and local attraction around Belfast.

We will definitely use this Hotel again and recommend it to our friends.",5,2014,05,29
226,Lovely hotel for a city break!!,This hotel is of a good location in the city centre the only problem is the noise level from the busy road beside! But other than that the rooms are lovely with all the necessities you need and friendly staff! :) ,5,2014,05,28
226,Fabulous hotel!,"My husband and I stayed here in march to celebrate our 10th wedding anniversary. We were warmly welcomed at reception and after checking in had some gorgeous cocktails in the bar. Our meal in the restaurant was excellent and the central location meant we could go out for a few drinks in other places. Breakfast was one of the best I've had in any hotel, freshly cooked to order. Haven't a single complaint about our stay! ",5,2014,05,28
226,"good location, good staff but....","The hotel is certainly well situated and reception staff/ concienge are most helpful. The room was tired and quiet small for a boutique type hotel. The carpet was ripped by the bathroom and one of the electric sockets loose in the wall. The breakfasts seem to cost a small fortune, we got stung for ¬£25 for two which is really not good value. 
Its nice, but 'SquareTen' is a so so much nicer.",3,2014,05,28
226,"Friendly staff, great location","I frequently stay with this hotel, and the guys know me by name at this point. Excellent staff make the stay, very friendly, always ready to help with any request. 
Very comfortable rooms, spacious, great for business travel, free wi-fi  always a plus. 
Great location, but parking can be expensive. Thanks to Danielle McGlone especially for managing all the constant changing of schedules which are done with no issue and the efficient front desk who check me in about 25 seconds.",4,2014,05,27
226,Good Hotel -- Great Location,"My wife and I stayed here for three nights recently and really enjoyed our stay. I had upgraded and we received a street facing, nicely appointed spacious room. Breakfast each morning was very good with plenty of choice and good service. The one evening meal we booked was somewhat disappointing but there are plenty of places to dine out due to the central location of the hotel. Staff were very attentive and courteous when called upon. In particular, the cocktail bar is very good indeed especially if you can get your hands on one of the cosy booths. Be warned though, this bar is a popular spot with locals and theatre goers on weekends. Overall I would recommend this hotel and will re-visit in the future.

Points to note:

1. Parking is quite expensive but is adjacent to the premises and secure.
2. Make sure you are billed in your own currency and not Sterling as you may not be asked.
3. Charges may be made against your credit card immediately and not pre-auth.",4,2014,05,27
226,Weekend Stay,"We had a fantastic stay at the Fitzwilliam Hotel Belfast. To start the breakfast was fabulous and very accommodating to suit dietary requirements (vegetarian) and special requests that were not on the menu. The concierge and receptionist staff were ever so helpful, in particular Declan and John or James at concierge and Michelle at reception. Concierge not only checked in online for our flight home providing us with a print out copy (as could only check-in 36hours prior to travel), they also provided us with a map of Belfast pointing us in the right direction of points of interest and recommendations. The rooms were spacious and offered a large bathroom which contained both a shower and bath. The hotel we very central and within walking distance of all main attractions in Belfast and situated within a few minutes walk of the bus station which offered direct aircoach to Dublin. We would definitely visit this hotel again in the future.",5,2014,05,27
226,Hotel is fabulous!,"Beautiful hotel! The design throughout the hotel is fabulous to say the least.. The rooms are spacious and well laid out! Bathrooms are a great size.. Very funky style throughout the whole place, loved the decor! Was such a treat to stay here.. Staff are lovely! And location was great.. Only let down was that parking is ridiculously over price as is the cost of breakfast at the hotel ¬£20 per person!!!!! ",4,2014,05,27
226,Standards have slipped,"We stayed here for 1 night last weekend on a dinner and b&b package. Having stayed here before, we were looking forward to our return trip but were left feeling a little disappointed. While the staff are still as friendly and helpful as ever the hotel itself is quite tired looking and in need of some TLC. The dark black & white colour scheme interior of our room showed up every scuff and mark that needed treating. 1 of the lamps in the room didn't work and we had to ask for a new iron as the one in our room was broken. The small shelf in the bathroom isn't big enough for toiletries. The bathroom is very dark - not great lighting for putting on make up ladies!! We also only had 1 bottle of water between us both and one glass, surely in a double room there should be 2 of each? We were very disappointed to learn the restaurant is no longer ran by Kevin Thornton and the standard of food has definitely slipped as a consequence. To be honest it was no better than a good gastro pub - but still the same price as when the ""celebrity chef"" was there?! Service in the restaurant was slow but it was very busy and when we asked for some water we were given two small tumblers of tap water, surely very restaurant offer a jug??! overall, the stay was OK, but disappointing.",3,2014,05,27
226,Wonderful stay - modern and welcoming,"Staff were very friendly and welcoming, hotel was modern and luxurious and food brilliant.
Considering the location, found it to be well sound-proofed and quiet. Fantastic location for exploring Belfast and the concierge are very helpful in booking taxis/storing luggage/providing information etc.
We were there as part of a hen party and did the Cocktail Masterclass in the Penthouse, it was fantastic - great views over Belfast and well run by the staff.
Dinner in the restaurant was of a high standard and breakfast the next morning was amazing. Can help yourself to continental-style pastries, yoghurts, fruits and cereals and then order a hot breakfast from the kitchen so it's fresh. So good!
I would definitely want to stay here if I visited Belfast again. Thanks.",5,2014,05,27
226,Not a 5* hotel !!!,"On arriving I made eye contact with the girl at front desk and smiled, she promptly ignored me and looked away. Our room had a few small tiles missing from the shower, the grey netting over the window was ripped and roughly sewed up, a bit shabby for 5*. When ordering a drink in the bar that night there were three bar staff on and yet it took between 10-15min to get our drink to the table. On checking out the same delightful girl was on the phone talking about a night out, she continued to do so while I stood there for a while and eventually told her friend she would call her back in 5!!!!! She was obviously annoyed with me as she made no eye contact and didn't crack a smile. Altogether a poor experience, they could learn a lot from The Merchant, now that is pure 5* !",3,2014,05,26
226,Total decadence,"This was our second stay in the Fitzwilliam in Belfast and both times have been lush.  Each room we have had has been extremely comfortable, amazing decor, minibar,sofa, cracker views, heated mirrors to prevent steaming up and luxurious finishes to make your room perfect. The attention to detail throughout the hotel is certainly noticed, we even had a little welcome plate of treats in our room as it was a birthday trip.

We did not use the other services in the hotel due to plans being made outside of the hotel but on our next stay we will avail of the food etc. However, I did see the car valet service in use which is also a great service to those drivers.

Location is perfect for people wanting a city break or even a break to kick back and relax. 

We seem to have been very lucky as on both stays the hotel had famous people also stay so you never know who you might meet :)

Minibar prices are VERY expensive, even for a bottle of water. There is a Tesco Express across from the front door of the hotel which sells everything you would need.",5,2014,05,25
226,Not impressed,"I booked this hotel for my elderly grandmother and her friend - they were going to see a show in the Grand Opera House and I thought booking the Fitzwilliam would be a real treat for them - I couldn't have been more disappointed.
When I dropped them off, I accompanied them in due to both of them having mobility issues.  I checked them in and luckily I was there because no one offered to carry their bags despite them both using walking aids!
When we got to to the room, it was a double bed ... When I booked I asked for a twin room (Please note this was ¬£155 for bed and breakfast) and eventually someone came to change the room into a twin room ... so nobody could unpack or settle down until this happened.
Then came dinner, which was an extra ¬£17.95 per person for the pre-theatre menu ... Being older, the two of them don't have a great appetite, however even they were horrified when they saw the size of the portions and asked if their dinner of salmon on a bed of ordinary garden peas came with any potatoes ... they didn't and were told that the sides would be ""extra"".  The sides had to be ordered due to tiny portions on the plate.  Dessert was next, and a lemon cake, which neither of them could even cut into ... it was stale.  What an atrocious experience in what is supposed to be a top class hotel in Belfast.  I will most definitely be taking my custom elsewhere.",1,2014,05,22
226,Quiet oasis in busy city centre,"I stayed here overnight while helping my son move flat. I hit the jackpot with a last minute website offering me this opportunity at a much cheaper rate than normal since it was a Monday evening.
I had a much needed luxurious stay and greatly welcomed the hot , powerful showers and the restorative sleep in the wonderfully comfortable bed cocooned in a pitch black room. The decor is very contemporary with geometric patterns everywhere, black paintwork and mirrors sparkling in the darkened spaces. Everything was of a high spec. Thick pile carpets, Bed linen, toiletries, hairdryer, ironing board, tv, safe, coffee facilities and a well stocked fridge. Oh yes and a magnifying mirror on bathroom..such a bonus! No expense has been spared here. I was on a room only tariff so cannot comment of food. I did spend a few hours in the lounge and the service and staff were very friendly. It is located in a busy city centre so you are perfectly sorted for sightseeing on foot, for theatres on your doorstep, for multiple restaurants etc., nearby. The main Europa bus depot is behind the hotel so the airport bus can leave you off at the side door. Loca bus tours start from here too. Even Dublin coach and train departs close by too for any day trips. The location is less ideal if you have your own transport. Having said this overnight parking is available and a day time car park is right across the road. But at a cost. Especially if you are in and out of the hotel during the course of the day. It's the one drawback. Had a lovely time and would love to return.",4,2014,05,21
226,Good Location,The Fitzwilliam Hotel is in a great location for visiting the local attractions. The room wasn't the most spacious but the decor is tastefully done.  My only negative about the room was the poor view which was of another building and a car park. The car park is expensive if you stay for two nights as we did (34pounds).  The bed was extremely comfortable and you could hear very little noise from the corridor or the street.  We ate in the bar which was reasonably priced and they have an extensive cocktail menu. The staff were very attentive throughout our stay and made us feel very welcome at the hotel.,4,2014,05,20
226,Lunch,"Recently came here for lunch with my family for my mums birthday, very nice looking bar and menu service was excellent.
Also a mention to Victoria one of the mangers who was extremely nice and helpful asking us if everything was and if she could do anything for us to make sure that our lunch was an enjoyable experience.

Will definitely becoming back",5,2014,05,18
226,"Stylish and comfortable, in a central location","The hotel is located conveniently within walking distance of the main shopping areas in the city, beside the Europa hotel and Opera house. And despite its central location, it doesn't feel like an overly busy or noisy area. Staff at the Fitzwilliam are very professional, from the check in team, to the concierge - all are clearly well versed in how a customer should be treated at a hotel. A service far too often overlooked in most places. In terms of the rooms, they are tastefully designed, sleek and elegant. There is a air of class about the finishing touches in the decor, from lighting, fabrics and colours used in the decor. The impressively thick curtains will ensure you are not woken by morning sunshine. Even the corridors are darkened, with a sense that any noise will be somehow consumed by the carpet or walls. For our one night here, a great sleep was enjoyed - no issues with room temperature or uncomfortable beds! 

In terms of the lobby area and hotel bar, I was less impressed. This was mainly due to the fact that we stayed here on a Sunday - which I must warn you is a bad idea. Like a lot of UK cities, Belfast is extremely quiet on a Sunday night. You will find it quite difficult to find a choice of bars or restaurants to keep you entertained, a problem that the concierge alluded to. Therefore the hotel bar itself was probably suffering a similar fate, it was deserted and had a not so pleasant odour - the kind of smell an empty bar has after a Saturday night. Tinged with bleach and stale vomit. So that was my only real gripe. That and the lack of free parking. If you have a car, best option is to park in McCausland which is adjacent the hotel on Grosvenor Road, cheaper and just as secure.",4,2014,05,17
226,"Location, rooms and breakfast couldn't be bettered","This is a first class hotel, bang in the centre of Belfast, and main attractions, restaurants etc.  Everything you would expect from such a place, without the snootiness -  we were in walking gear and fairly scruffy but were treated with great courtesy by friendly and helpful and cheerful staff.  The room was not large, but well appointed, and unlike almost all other hotels I have ever stayed in it was dark at night, with proper blackout lining to the curtains and no flashing lights etc from smoke alarms etc.  The breakfast was expensive but very good.  All in all a very good experience",5,2014,05,17
226,One of my favourites in Belfast,"Stayed in Fitzwilliam for a business meeting. Rooms are very spacious and individual.  Great location, easy walking to the city centre.  Nice, intimate car / wine bar with friendly staff.  Had a business breakfast (Ulster Fry) with clients and a meeting in the top floor Boardroom with stunning views over the city.  Would definitely be on my shortlist next time.",4,2014,05,13
226,Perfect Belfast spot!,"Great hotel, super friendly staff and great location.  Walking distance to everything.  Easy drive in from the airport.  Big and beautifully decorated rooms and comfy beds.  Big bathrooms with double showers and tub.  Highly recommend.",5,2014,05,11
226,Wedding night stay,I stayed with my wife on our wedding night in the hotel. We had agreed with a member of staff for 3 rooms for our stay to accommodate our parents also. Being New Years eve you would think there would be some entertainment in the hotel or a good atmosphere. We were sadly disappointed. Also the fact that we turned up in our wedding clothes and received absolutely no acknowledgement of the day either from staff or in our room was also disappointing. Our room in fairness was very nice but my parents complained that the smell coming from there toilet was intolerable. On complaining to the management we received half my parents rooms fee back. The money was not important as the memory was tainted. The breakfast was adequate and basic. Overall this hotel lacks personal touch or great customer service. Best avoided if you like a warm friendly welcome and treatment.,2,2014,05,11
226,Slightly disappointing,"We stayed for 1 night over Easter. Having read great reviews my expectations were high but the hotel didn't live up to them. The room was a lovely design but had red marks on the carpet and other housekeeping issues. We chose to pay ¬£17 for the secure parking but the procedure was not clear on arrival and there is very limited waiting area. The food in the restaurant was mediocre and we had to wait a very long time for desert. The door handle was missing from the inner stairwell, so having walked down the stairs we couldn't get out at the other end. Whilst these are all quite minor issues, standards should be higher in such an expensive hotel.
On the positive side I would agree that the staff are incredibly friendly, and the location is excellent.",4,2014,05,07
226,not as swish as we'd hoped for but a great nights sleep!,"Stayed here on a weekend break in December 2013.  The room was very nice but it's not swish or luxurious, more business than luxury.  It's far from my usual idea of boutique, although they are getting at something like boutique with some of the styling.  To be honest, it was fine as far as hotel rooms go, although the bathroom products and occasional scruffy finished did irritate me.  

You will stay here for a)location (fab and with a fairly priced car park down the road) and b) a brilliant night sleep thanks to the very comfortable bed, good linen and amazing blackouts c)service (northern ireland hospitality is great, truly service with a smile).

We didn't eat here-we went for brunch to a fab cafe near the Botanic Gardens.",3,2014,05,06
226,excellent location,i had the pleasure of staying in the Fitzwilliam hotel on the 25th and the26th april 2014 on arrival we were met with a concierge of the highest standard  who was most helpful and ever so polite  as was all the staff and the rooms were spotless with all the home comforts and the hotel is in the heart of Belfast  close to all amenities  and city hall i will definately be back,5,2014,05,06
226,Enjoyable stay," Had a lovely two night stay for the bank holiday weekend. Our room was spotless, staff were very friendly, location was excellent and I loved the modern design. Only thing was our bathroom door didn't lock or close proper and we got given coffee for a filter coffee machine but there was no coffee machine in the room? Didn't bother saying these things to staff though so may possibly have been fixed if we had. Would stay again anyway. ",4,2014,05,05
226,Excellent!,My husband and I stayed in The Fitzwilliam for our wedding Anniversary (we got upgraded because it was our Anniversary) can not fault this hotel at all! Rooms are amazing as are the staff & food. Location is perfect. Can't wait to go back in the future :-) ,5,2014,05,04
226,very good hotel,The Fitzwilliam is a very good hotel in a good location in Belfast. The public areas are stylish and the rooms are very well equipped and nicely comfortable. Staff are very efficient. Breakfast was good the only complaint I would make is that tea really should be made with boiling water.,4,2014,05,04
226,Nice hotel but level of service doesn't really match standard,"The Fitzwilliam in Belfast is really nice (lobby & rooms) and the location is really convenient. However the attitude of the staff at the front desk did not really match our expectations of a luxury hotel - first we were ignored as we wanted to check in, then (as it was good friday) the woman kept on explaining us that they will not be selling alcohol but we can bring our own and drink it in the room etc - also spoke very fast and with a strong accent and did not really change even though she must have realized that it was not easy for us to understand as we kept on asking her to repeat things. Parking is expensive! 17 GBP /day.",3,2014,04,26
226,Go There.....,"This is a great hotel in a great location. Located in the city centre, adjacent to shops, restaurants, bars etc.  We visited the Titanic Museum, did a trip on a Tour Bus and all within walking distance to the hotel.   Staff were very friendly and knowledgable and did their utmost to make our stay as pleasant as possible.    Lovely boutique style hotel ..... Would highly recommend for a stay in Belfast!  Ideal location and great value for money!!",4,2014,04,25
226,"A chic, centrally located hotel.","We had a very pleasant stay at this hotel. The room was spacious with a comfortable bed and lovely blackout blinds. The decor is very chic. The staff were friendly and the hotel is in a good, central location. The only negative was there was no complimentary water in the room as stated on the website and a few biscuits to go with the tea wouldn't go amiss. Use McCausland's car park up the street (¬£14 for 24 hours)  as the hotel has very limited parking for ¬£17 per night. ",4,2014,04,25
226,Great location,"Had difficulty finding as no storer number listed on web. Saw f on building and turned off great Victoria.. Dinner worth eating in hotel. Breakfast not worth money.  Friendly, helpful staff. Walking distance on many attractions. Next door to theaters.",4,2014,04,23
226,Great place for a great value,"This place is awesome.  I stayed here for 2 weeks, for ""work purposes"" and was recognized by the staff on a daily basis and had a good room rate, free breakfasts every morning and was warmly greeted by friendly staff on a daily basis.  The concierge at the front desk can help you find or ""get into"" what ever kind of thing you have an inclination to do.  Whether do a bus tour, private tour up the coast to the Giants Causeway or just find a really great place to eat.  I had a great experience here and would go back again.",5,2014,04,23
226,Regular Stay,"I stay here whenever I go to Belfast with work, lovely Hotel, great bar area, welcoming staff, and fantastic breakfasts. Rooms are clean, modern and well maintained. Discounted car parking over the road for ¬£5 at Macausland is also a bonus for a city center, but make sure you tell them you are at the Hotel or it is ¬£14. Gym area is small with just a couple of machines and no other leisure facilities, which you may expect from a 5 star hotel.",4,2014,04,22
226,"Romantic stay, fabulous location, I loved it.","Gorgeous, comfortable relaxing hotel with friendly staff. Everything was perfect for us which meant we had a lovely romantic weekend. There's not one thing I could fault about this hotel. If you can afford to stay here it is a must.",5,2014,04,21
226,Loved it,"Loved it. Staff were fantastic in particular the bar staff, One barman from the USA clearly loves what he does with a real passion but everyone was great.

Triple cooked chips were so nice.

Beds so comfy, design and layout so modern and and we had the best nights sleep here.

It's fair to say it's pricey but I would say it's what you'd expect for somewhere special, if prices were low it would lose it exclusive feel as everyone would go there. 

You can pay ¬£14 for 24 hours to park a 1 min walk away or ¬£17 for valet parking.

The only negative I would say is they were unable to cater for our last minute request of afternoon tea but in total fairness it does say to book. 

Very likely to return here.

",5,2014,04,20
226,Nice hotel,"We stayed here on 12th April, on the whole it was a pleasant experience. The receptionist was pleasant and professional. ¬£17 for car parking was I feel a bit steep. The main foyer was chilly and the bar a bit unfriendly, staff were pleasant. The room was great, decor top class and all facilities there. Breakfast was a wee bit disappointing, a buffet is much more enjoyable as it allows you to choose what you would like. All staff were pleasant,  would stay again",4,2014,04,20
226,Fantastic.,I stayed here on Good Friday with my partner just for a small getaway. From check in to check out everything was perfect! Special mention to Matthew behind the bar who is incredible at making cocktails and who was very friendly.  We also went for an evening meal within the hotel which was amazing. The employees within this hotel truly are skilled at what they do! Top class.,5,2014,04,19
226,Do not recommend this hotel for a relaxing stay!,"Customer service in hotel is shocking. ¬£17 for car parking, over priced drinks in the bar, poor breakfast and unhelpful staff.  Horrible disturbance on the floor, riot police and ambulance called. I understand that this was out of the hotels control however I was very shaken and would have expected the hotel to ensure that we were ok and at least apologise for the disruption when we checked out. However I feel this was poorly handled. After disruption I finally fell asleep to be woken around 4 by loud music and a party in the room next to us. When we had to call to alert staff we were told oh we know who it is.  Not what I expected from a so called top hotel. I do not recommend the hotel to anyone  who is looking a nights sleep or a relaxing stay. Very unhappy customer.",1,2014,04,19
226,Business trip to Belfast.,"This hotel came highly recommended. I had great expectations on my first visit to Belfast what I got was disappointment. I checked in, allocated a room and made my way upstairs. I got in the room to find it was  freezing. I called down to reception and ask that someone look at the air conditioning. Eventually after sitting around for about 10 minutes maintenance arrived and indeed confirmed there was a problem. He rung down to reception and asked that I was given another room. He left a few minutes later and immediately the TV and lights went off, controlled I assume by reception. I sat there in the dark for what like seemed an age eventually ringing reception, asking what was happening? I was moved finally to another room. You might think all then ended happily.....no!! The next room was allocated was so hot I had to open all windows. I decided it was not worth another complaint as I wasn't quite sure what the next room condition would be. The air conditioning didn't work in this room either so I spent several days in the Bahamas in Belfast. On the plus side the breakfast was lovely!!!",1,2014,04,17
226,Great Stay,"Stayed at the FItzwilliam with my wife for a one night break, really enjoyed our stay and staff were very helpful when we asked about things to do.  The hotel lobby is a bit small but nice seating area where we had a drink before bed.  Bedroom was clean, quiet at night (we were on a high floor) and the hotels location was great, the wife could wander over to the shopping areas while I went to the golf shops.  Would stay again but I do think the rates were a touch on the high side.",4,2014,04,17
226,Wonderful Hotel,"Stayed here for a short three day break.  Outstanding hotel, wonderful staff so friendly and pleased to help at all times. Rooms are very stylish and well equipped. We ate in the restaurant twice during our stay, food and service both excellent. We also tried the bar menu once and again an excellent meal. The hotel is very central to all the main tourist attractions and the concierge arranged a tour of the North Antrim Coast for us. Not to be missed, a fantastic day. All in all a wonderful visit to a great city with the friendliest locals I've ever met. The Fitzwilliam Hotel carries on this tradition and I would certainly stay here again.",5,2014,04,13
226,The Fitzwilliam hotel,My stay in hotel was first class staff were very friendly and rooms were nice and clean. The food was gorgeous my only thing that I think the hotel is missing is  leisure facilities other than that I would recommend the hotel for people to stay in.,4,2014,04,13
226,lovely 4 day break,"i stayed at the fitzwiliam with my husband on a short break.  i had never been to Ireland before so was intrigued as to what i was going to find. on arrival at the hotel (3hours before we were due to check in) the receptionist was very welcoming and eager to assist us, our room wasn't ready but this wasn't an issue the concierge took our cases and put them away safe until our room was ready.  this allowed us to go get some breakfast and have a look around the area.  when we returned 4 hrs later our cases were in our room. the room was very well presented with a king bed, a couch, desk with a phone and a large mirror. the bathroom was very well appointed, with a large walk in shower, a lovely big bath and very nicely tiled. there is a tv that does everything including the internet.  all in all we couldn't fault the hotel or staff, whom were always pleasant and very happy to help.  whilst there we used the tour bus 2 days in a row.  the tour guides on these buses are very well informed and remember you when you go back for the second day, so if your going to Belfast this is a hotel i would highly recommend and you have to do the tour bus.",5,2014,04,12
226,Great business hotel,"Convenient, central location. Pleasant choice for breakfast. Good value. Lovely touches. Classical music playing in the room when I arrived, tea and coffee making facilities and the rooms and bathrooms are spacious and well appointed. The only criticism is that the gym is tiny and carpeted - but it does have 24 hour access. ",5,2014,04,08
226,Perfect location,"My wife and I stayed at the Fitzwilliams for 3 nights in March. The location and the service were outstanding, everything within walking distance and great customer service from the staff, specially the Concierge. Very spacious room with all the amenities necessary to make it a great stay. We will stay there again.",5,2014,04,07
226,superb what an amazing hotel,This is one of the most amazing hotels we have ever stayed in from the time we pulled up outside the hotel till the time we left we were taken care of im not joking this is a hotel that prides themselves on perfection the food was superb and breakfast was just the thing you can relax and enjoy you dont just leave without feeling like you have had a holiday whdether you chek in overnight or for a weekend if I could imagine what heaven is like this would be it we have stayed here 4 times and it just gets better and better thank you fitzwilliam you really are thatt good,5,2014,04,02
226,loved the suite.  executive room was excellent as well.,"First off,   Great service from bellman and front desk team.  This is a stylish and comfortable hotel.  Sophisticated without being uptight.  Go for the suite.  It's spacious and the bed was super comfy.  very nice ammenities and excellent views of the Mountain Mourne and cityscape.  Nice furnishing and great toiletries.  Our friend stayed in the executive room and it was spacious and comfy as well.  I wouldn't have mind but we splurged for my partner's birthday.  Didn't hear our neighbors the whole time even though the hotel was booked.  Excellent all around.  Unfortunately, can't say the same about the Fitzwilliam's Dublin (seperate review).  

BTW.  Belfast is a great destination city.  Great art galleries and dinning options.  Don't miss Mourne Seafood or the pubs.  Sophisticated city with warm locals.",5,2014,04,02
226,FRIDAY NIGHT BLITZ!,"Best Hotel, Best Rooms and most of all Best Staff. In no particular order: MEL, SANDRA, KATY, CAT, BRIAN, ANDREW, DEC, DAVE, JOHNNY, EMMA, LAURNA(OR LAUREN, SORRY), ANGELINE. If they any if forgotten, its just I keep misspelling names.

226,Unbelievable!!! Fantastic staff and hotel,"What can I say the team in the hotel did a fantastic job for my parents 30th wedding anniversary! My parents were meant to go to Barcelona two days before there stay in the Fitzwilliam but as my mum took sick they had to cancel there travels, so I booked them into the Fitz as it was close to home! Well they loved every minute of it staff were friendly greeting them with a happy anniversary glass of champagne and upgrade of their room! Special thank you to Melissa for helping me organise all the wee treat for them! You can rest assure they'll be back for my mum 60th thank you so much x  ",5,2014,03,31
226,Wonderful stay in  a luxurious hotel,"We enjoyed a great stay at this hotel and would highly recommend.  The room was more than comfortable and delivered all that is expected of a good hotel.  Staff at all levels friendly, helpful and accommodating.  We enjoyed a light lunch which of course was very good.  I definitely would revisit.",5,2014,03,26
226,Brilliant,"A short walk from the Europa bus station is this fabulous hotel. This hotel is in a brilliant location with plenty of bars and restaurants close by. We arrived very early at the hotel as we had come in on a fairly early flight and we were planning on just asking for a map so we could start our tour around Belfast. But we were amazed to be told our room was ready and we could check in.  The reception Staff  were extremely polite and friendly . We had paid extra to stay in a deluxe room and goodness it was worth it. Amazing views of Belfast from the bedrooms double aspect  windows.  Probably one of the nicest rooms we have ever stayed in, so on our return home we  booked to stay here again later on in the year, So that says it all.",5,2014,03,25
226,Afternoon Tea,"Had afternoon tea today at The Fitzwilliam as an early Mothers Day treat for my mum. From the moment we arrived our waiter Brian made us feel very welcome. We were given the choice of having it in the bar/lounge area or the lobby. We opted for the lobby beside the fire. Comfortable, quiet & more private than you would think.
Brian certainly knew his teas & the choice of sandwiches, pastries etc was scrumptious. I was also lucky enough to have a great choice of gluten free treats!
A lovely afternoon was had by all & we cant praise Brian enough for his attention throughout our 3 hour stay.",4,2014,03,25
226,Cocktail making class,"I booked in for the cocktail making class in March 2014. There was a group of 10 girls who took part in the cocktail masterclass at the hotel followed by a 3 course dinner in the restaurant.

The hotel staff were excellent, greeting us in reception and showing us to the room the class was taking place in. Our class was on the top floor of the hotel with great views of the city and the room was lovely. Our cocktail class was fantastic and everyone had great fun making and trying the cocktails. Our host was great too, he was called Dave and was very knowledgeable and patient with a large group of girls. He made us all feel welcome and gave us all a laugh. Canapes and champagne were also served whilst we tasted the cocktails.

After the class we moved down to the restaurant for our three course meal. It was excellent, there was a good selection, portion sizes were good and the staff were very attentive.

The staff couldn't do enough for us and nothing was too much trouble. We had a great hen party here and I would definitely recommend!",5,2014,03,25
226,"Lovely hotel, great bar staff and cocktails","Stayed for 3 nights last weekend and loved every minute. we arrived at 11.15am and our room was ready and we were checked in promptly. Reception staff, very professional, a little too much for us, not much warmth, very business like.
Bar staff are outstanding, professional, funny, knowledgeable and mix a mean cocktail. Food in bar is nice, nothing outstanding but very nice. Bar itself is lovely, furnished in lovely bright colours, and very comfortable with a great atmosphere especially on Friday and Saturday nights with plenty of staff serving. 
Rooms are marvellous, large, bright and comfortable with a lovely bathroom. We were on the 6th floor with lovely views over the hills. Very little traffic noise.
Breakfast was included and both the buffet and cooked selection was lovely and very tasty. Service attentive. One bug was the kitchen door slamming every time a member staff entered or exited,  Most off putting and stopped us booking in to the restaurant just in case we got seated near it.
within walking distance of all major attractions, we hired a car to drive to the Giants causeway and then followed the coastal route back - outstanding. Hired from Europcar, just a 5 minute walk from hotel and great rates if you booked in advance on line.
Titanic exhibition is wonderful as is afternoon tea there, the Hop on hop off bus is great value and worth a ride.
Mournes Seafood and Howard street Restaurants are outstanding as is Kelly Cellars, best pint of Guinness in the city. Crown Liquor Saloon worth popping in to, the d√©cor is so ornate it is breath-taking.
Airport bus 300 ¬£10.50 return, get off at the Europa Bus Centre, 2 minute walk to the hotel.",4,2014,03,25
226,Excellent Service,"Great hotel, service and location! We arrived on Saturday 22th March on a train from Dublin. It took about 20min to walk to the hotel. We didn't mind the walk and on the way we passed George's Market which is the best market i've ever been to in a city (open weekends only, voted no.1 UK Market 2014). we also seen the city hall on the way. However it was very cold so bring your gloves and coats for March. 
Our Hotel room was on the third floor and had a lovely view of the mountains behind floor to ceiling glazing Rm 319. We splashed out and booked the Titantic package with Fitzwilliam. It was expensive to our usual budget but we wanted something special and modern for a change. The room was perfect with free wifi and a good selection of TV channels. The bathroom surprisingly had a bath and separate shower. The best thing we both agreed on was the breakfast. There was  a good selection in the Continental buffet and the staff there were really nice and prompt. We were delighted to see pancakes on the menu and didn't hesitate to ask for bacon on the side. Sometimes the traditional breakfast is too heavy after that alcohol.  If I have any Cons. The selection of main course's on the package menu was't great. I had the Organic Salmon with noodles. The noodles were too salty and i would of sent it back had i noticed abit earlier. Still it was a good trip 5/5",5,2014,03,24
226,"Great location, great hotel","The Fitzwilliam is a beautiful hotel, very centrally located, friendly staff, excellent amenities.
We had a good value dinner menu, which included wine, and the food was delicious.
On the downside, Breakfast wasn't in the deal and the car parking fee was a little pricey.
However, it's a great hotel and we had a lovely time.",5,2014,03,24
226,Brilliant!,"My wife and I stayed at the Fitzwilliam Hotel last weekend for her birthday, and our overall experience was very enjoyable. The hotel is nicely designed with a bright lobby and reception area, where the staff are warm and welcoming. Even though the hotel was quite busy, the check in process was quick and painless. The Concierge brought our bag up to the room, which was spotlessly clean, and had a great view of the city. We were right beside the lifts, but there was no noise from the coming and going of other guests.  Some cocktails in the bar went down well, before heading out to dinner. My wife and I don't often get away for the night, so after organising babysitters and spending money on a hotel, it means so much more when there is no stress or problems, just a really relaxing experience in a nice setting with brilliant, professional staff. 
We look forward to staying again soon.",5,2014,03,24
226,Best Location & Best Hotel to stay in,"I stayed here in November 2013. I have nothing but positive things to say about my experience in this beautiful hotel. Upon arrival myself & my partner were greeted by a lovely receptionist who dealt with our check in and the parking of our car in a very warm & attentive manner. I booked a 'Studio Suite' via booking.com in the special remarks I said that we were celebrating our anniversary so just if they could assign a room with since view as I already had booked an amazing suite I wasn't expecting much more!

 Upon arriving to our room there was nice classical music playing softly in the background & a welcome card from the manager congratulating Mr & Mrs X on their wedding anniversary. Whilst it was a lovely touch it was funny as we are not married nor are we man & woman. We both got a great laugh out of this as did the receptionist when we told her when we were leaving that evening for dinner. It was a nice thought though.

The room was phenomenal with amazing linen, the bathroom is extraordinary and the view was gorgeous at night. The breakfast was great, with a good selection to choose from.

 All the staff were helpful, pleasant & attentive. I could not fault this hotel in anyway, and have recommended it to all my friends & family!

I cannot wait to stay here again!! :)",5,2014,03,22
226,Amazing,We stayed here for our anniversary they upgraded our room to the dulex room this stay was amazing. We had views all round the city. They gave us a complimentary bottle of bubbly and truffles. It was well worth the money and they made us feel so special. Would highly recommend the fitzwilliam ,5,2014,03,21
226,Excellent location,"We stayed here last September 2013 it was an excellent choice especially location wise. It was central to all the shops, restaurants, sight seeing etc.. The hotel it self was very nice we ate in the bar the first night and it was very tasty. The rooms though we're a bit on the small side as there were 3 of us staying as a family. The staff were nice but not too hands on at the same time which was a slight negative for me. Other wise I would highly recommend it.",4,2014,03,19
226,A couple of little things would have made it perfect,"I spent two nights here on a business trip.  The room I had was on the 2nd floor and right next to the lift lobby so I was concerned that I would be disturbed.  I need not have worried as I heard nothing from the lift lobby and although I could hear the traffic every now and then, it did not bother me.  Take it from me, I sleep very lightly and if it was a problem, I would have noticed it!  The room was spacious and nicely decorated.  There was a good sofa to sit on and the bed was large and comfortable.  The bathroom had a walk in shower which was good and a deep bath which I didn't use.  There was a shaving/makeup mirror which would have been helpful had the lighting been better.  The lighting was not really that good despite a lamp over the sink.  I did think that the shower could have been sightly cleaner where the tray met the tiling (a common problem).  Considering the cost of this hotel, I would have expected biscuits on the tea tray and a better selection of tea.  I also think that conditioner in the bathroom is an essential.  Breakfast was slightly disappointing.  My room cost included breakfast.  From memory continental breakfast costs ¬£12.95 and cooked costs ¬£16.95 which I think is quite pricey.  I had cooked on both days and my eggs benedict and kippers were cooked perfectly.  However, I was not offered toast on either day and my kippers were more accurately descibed as kipper singular.  I asked for toast on the second day when my kipper arrived and was told that it might take a bit of time.  Actually it didn't take that long but why would something like toast not be offered on arrival and be organised properly so that there would not be a wait?  The buffet was fine if unremarkable.  Cereal featured very heavily.  Fruit and yoghurt was nice.  Not a huge amount of choice otherwise.  I did also have room service having arrived at about 9pm although I was told when I arrived that the restaurant was fully booked so that was really my only option.  On ringing for room service I was told that as the restaurant was busy I would have to wait 45 minutes to an hour.  Actually it was less than that but all the same rather off putting.  The club sandwich was fine although the skinny fries describled on the menu were the fattest chips I have seen for a long time!  The staff were very helpful at both check in and out and the concierge pleasant and friendly.",4,2014,03,17
226,A good stay,"Booked the hotel well in advance and was able to get a very good rate for the 2 nights. Room was comfortable, clean and well appointed. Staff were pleasant so overall no issues. Food in the bar was good as well.",4,2014,03,16
226,Overall-a great weekend,"This hotel,which is in a terrific city centre location, is beautifully furnished and immaculately clean. Service was excellent and the room itself was very comfortable and quiet. The food was OK, there are much better places to eat in Belfast, but the portions were large and desserts were tasty so overall I can't complain. 
Would love it if this hotel had spa facilities. 
Will definitely go back if staying overnight in the city.",4,2014,03,16
226,"Great hotel, poor service","We stayed here quit some time ago, the hotel is in a perfect location, i would say a very good 4 star hotel. We asked for towels on the second night which never came and when mentioned the next morning was dismissed. The bar staff were particularly slow so much so that we had to go up twice to find out where are drinks where.",3,2014,03,15
226,Totally Outstanding,"This is a five star hotel in Belfast, situated in the centre of Belfast with easy walking to the shops and bars and restaurants

I am a fairly regualr visitor to this Hotel when in Northern Ireland on Business and the reason I return is that is always the same, the servcie is outstanding, the rooms  are beautifully appointed and the beds are so comfy.

I would not stay anywhere else in Belfast and would change my dates if they were full to make sure I got my night at the Fitzwilliam.

The restuarnt has excellent food and is well cooked and prepared. The Staff at this Hotel are first class, helpful and kind and hospitality is oozing from every area.

Upgrade to a suite, the double shower is amazing!!",5,2014,03,14
226,"Great hotel, well positioned for City centre","Modern and very comfortable hotel. Extremely comfortable bed and well equipped large room. All the staff (who were mainly Irish) were very friendly and helpful, they even opened an extra room for our party to have drinks as the bar was full. Breakfast was well presented with continental buffet and hot food to order. We would definitely stay at this hotel again and would happily recommend to anyone wanting a comfortable, well equipped hotel in a great location.",5,2014,03,12
226,Hotel Review Nothing Personal,I visited this hotel with a friend for dinner and cocktails and got nothing but polite service and quality food. I found the bar to be cosy and warm (nothing nicer than a warm bar) and could of quite easily sat on had I not to get up for work the next day. I did notice the bar was busy and could see the strain on staff but trip advisor is a website for reviews on hotel and service therfore I won't hide behind my trip advisor comments and personally attack staff members. Overall I had great drinks and great food in a cosy environment and would/will be back again.,5,2014,03,11
226,Great Hotel shame about the arrogant bartender.....,"We booked the Fitzwilliam as a 30th birthday treat! Hotel is fab, got a superior Room, comfy & modern! Breakfast was excellent, great choice and well presented!
we went on the evening of our stay to the bar and had some cocktails, we were served by Jonathon who was to be honest full of himself, he made great cocktails but when we ordered our second round of drinks, my hubby placed ¬£20 on the counter and he turned to us and said, 'you'll need more than that', we were puzzled. he produced a receipt for 2 cocktails and 2 pints of beer, we had already paid for our first round of drinks and even gave him a tip!!!! the cheek.
I said, 'excuse me, we have already paid for the first drinks', to which he cheekily replied, 'who did you pay it wasn't me?'
only when we reminded him we had given him a tip did he remember and well he was very embarrassed. I was insulted that he was accusing us of not paying, luckily we had our receipt on the bar to prove it. He did apologise and afterwards offered us a complimentary drink but the damage was done and we left after the second drink.
really enjoyed our stay and would come back but not to Jonathon and his cocktails.",4,2014,03,10
226,Great hotel.  Outstanding Bar staff.,"We spent 4 nights at the Fitzwilliam.  Located in the heart of where you should be in Belfast, the hotel is warm and inviting.  The concierge team was extremely helpful with reservations and recommendations.  The housekeeping team was friendly and efficient. But, a special nod has to go to the bar.  Jonathan served me on two of my nights there.  Sure, he can pour a cold beer or serve a simple vodka and tonic with flair.   But, his mastery of the bar scene comes through when he crafts a special drink for you.  For me, the two drinks that stand out were his takes on the Manhatten and an old-fashioned.  The Manhatten was highlighted by a house-infused bourbon barrel aged on premise for 12 weeks.  Phenomenal. And the old-fashioned -- Jonathan's take on this classic is to make a smokey old fashioned.  His bar ""smoker"" infuses hickory chips into your beverage -- with the smoke infusion occurring right before your seat.  Masterful.  

Again, a great stay at this hotel.  And made all the better by a warm staff and the creations delivered by Jonathan at the bar.",5,2014,03,06
226,Just the two of us.....,"My husband booked a night for us in the Fitzwilliam as a belated Valentine's day gift, as we didn't want to go too far from home.  We knew we would go straight from work at lunchtime on Friday so my husband rang the hotel to ask what time we could check in.  He was told that check in was 2pm but if we arrived earlier and a room was ready, we could check in early at no extra charge.  On arrival at the hotel, approximately 12.45pm, we were promptly greeted by the concierge who directed us to reception and offered to take our bag but we only had a small overnight bag so we declined.  The staff on reception were very friendly and we were dealt with very quickly.  We were placed on the 7th floor, which pleased us greatly as we had a great view of Cavehill.  We had obviously looked at pictures of the rooms online and we were not disappointed when we entered the room, it was modern, spacious and very comfortable.  The bathroom has a double shower, a large, deep bath and a ""taller loo"" which to someone who is 5'11"" like me is nice!  The super kingsize bed was extremely comfortable and the blackout curtains kept every bit of daylight out.  I did worry that traffic noise may have kept us awake but neither of were bothered by it at all.  We booked the hotel on a room only basis so I can't comment on food.  The hotel has a wonderful location, it's close to the shops, several pubs and restaurants in the vicinity, a Tesco and Centra straight across the road and the Grand Opera House right next door.  This hotel has all the extra little touches that you would expect in a 5 star but can be expensive for breakfast and parking, we used alternatives. However it is still excellent value for money. We only live 15 miles from the hotel, would we stay here next time we go on a shopping trip to Belfast? In a heartbeat!",5,2014,03,05
226,Great weekend!,"We've just come back from a weekend in Belfast and stayed at the Fitzwilliam for 3 nights. The location is great! The place looks great, friendly staff and good service. The rooms where nice an spacious, clean and comfortable. The bed was very comfy with good pillows.
The only thing we would comment is that the breakfast wasn't as good as we expected.
We had the breakfast included in our stay, but was a bit disappointed when the hot food was made to order and the quality varied a bit every day. 
Even though we had the breakfast included, we would expect more from a ¬£16 breakfast - especially compared to what you can get from some of the many restaurants in the same area. Besides this the rest of the breakfast was pretty good, with loads of choices in cereals, fruit, pasteries and really good coffee.
Otherwise we had a great stay at the Fitzwilliam and would happily recommend it to anyone planning a stay in Belfast!",5,2014,03,04
226,Excellent Hotel and very memorable stay....,"I stayed on a Saturday night with my girlfriend. The room was excellent and it was spotless. The staff at checkin were very friendly and helpful, as were all the staff throughout the hotel. I would have no hesitation in recommending this Hotel. This was a special stay for us as I asked my girlfriend to marry me in the Hotel room that night................ and she said yes. The Fitzwilliam Hotel will always be a special place for us and I am sure we will make a few return visits in the future.",5,2014,03,04
226,First Class Service and Accomodations,"This is a perfect example of how far a first impression can go.  We arrived in Belfast a bit early and I simply went into the hotel to ask a quick question for directions.  When told I was checking in later that day Phillip, the Concierge, not only asked my questions but also had us checked into the hotel and all of our activities arranged for and booked for our entire two day stay.  Before you knew it we were in our room waiting for our black taxi tour to come pick us up.  The taxi driver was already instructed to take us to our post tour destination and what time we needed to be there.  He then booked us a table for dinner that evening and gave us instructions for going to the Causeway the next day.  Not to mention a few recommendations on some pubs we could visit as well.  The room was fantastic as well.  We had no problems with the room but a service manager came and did a check on some lights anyway.  I guess an earlier guest had problems but it was fine while we were there.  The location was great for us.  Close to everything we wanted to see, including The Crown Liquor Saloon which is a must see across the street from this hotel if you stay here.  I highly recommend this hotel.",5,2014,03,03
226,"All The Good, None (Really) of the Bad","Stayed at the Fitzwilliam with friends , the hotel was central to a fantastic weekend in Belfast, central geographically as well as importance. I rather get the ""is it a four or five star?"" debate in some reviews. On one hand the staff are spot on, it's really well laid out and appointed in all areas. The bathrooms are great with a separate large shower and bath, the decor is nicely designed, beds and bedding crisp and comfortable. But if I am being very picky, and five stars are to be picked at I suppose. The settee in the room was a little frayed, not through wear more by bad design. We didn't take a newspaper our friends did and it turned out not to be complimentary as is usually the case in top hotels. Oh and a Coors Light in a Peroni glass......tut tut ;)
That said it's a top hotel and really well located, and it will definitely where we head next time over, four, four and a half or five star. ",4,2014,03,03
226,Very nice,"Stayed just the one night on Saturday in an exec room. Room was spot on as were the staff which made our stay just that little bit better.
Would recommend this hotel it's location was spot on. If we ever return to Belfast we will stay at the Fitzwilliam.",5,2014,03,03
226,Central Location. Great Hotel,"Just back from a one night stay that i won with work to this hotel. Hotel has a great location. Central to everything. Room was ready on check in at 12.00pm so we were delighted. Room was spotless. All staff through out the hotel were very friendly and helpful. Nothing was too much bother to them. Breakfast was included and plenty of choice with excellent service.
We would definitely stay here again.",5,2014,03,02
226,First stay for Birthday treat - won't be back,"I am just back from 2 nights in the Fitzwilliam hotel for my birthday. It was our first time staying in the hotel.
The hotel had been paid in advance by my friend as a gift so we were both looking forward to the weekend ahead.
On arrival we were greeted by one of the girls on reception who was very friendly but when we tried to book in she told us there was no room booked. We spent 15minutes trying to get the issue resolved as meanwhile she answered the reception phone to deal with other peoples queries.
Finally we got to our room. First thing that we noticed was that the main mirror in the bedroom was being blocked by a tv . So we had to try and use the bathroom door as a mirror but it was impossible to see as it was so dimly lit in the room. 
The power of the shower was not great and in cheaper hotels in belfast its much better
We then headed down to the bar before we headed out...we tried to have a conversation with a few of the male staff that served us but we merely received grunts or just yes or no as an answer. Very poor customer interaction. 
We headed out and later returned to our room. Only to realise that the heating would not come on. I contacted reception on the number provided and a man from the foyer came up and handed up a heater to plug in!! Not what i would expect from this hotel!!
We tried to get to sleep but the bed / pillows were unbelievable uncomfortable. So then decided to go outside for a smoke only for the same man from the foyer to say to 'should we not be sleeping' in a rather horrible tone. 
on our second night we had drinks ordered to our room before we went out only for the person delivering then to drop empty bottles and glasses all over the floor.
The whole experience was not what i expected and a birthday treat turned into a very poor weekend!",1,2014,03,02
226,Amazing stay!,"I booked 2 nights here as a surprise for my boyfriends 40th birthday and it was absolutely amazing. The room was stunning, toiletries were really luxurious and the staff were very welcoming and friendly. Check in was meant to be from 2pm but as our flight was early and there was a room available straight away, they did not mind us checking in early. 
Our room was on the 7th floor and was very quiet. 
I would definitely stay here again and would certainly recommend to anyone I know coming to belfast :) xxx",5,2014,03,01
226,An excellent place to stay,"We stayed for 2 nights on a short break - it's such a convenient location as you can walk to so many good pubs and restaurants.

The room was great, with a view over the city and a fantastically comfortable bed. Great shower and a full sized bath.

Only had breakfast and a couple of drinks, but all was good, with breakfast cooked to order and not congealing in a 'buffet'.

Highly recommended and great value compared to some other Belfast hotels.",5,2014,02,26
226,Second visit just as great as the last.,"We booked this break in October, as I'd previously stayed in February 2013.

Room service is second to none, concierge are immensely helpful at all hours. They even managed to help me avert a ""broken nail"" incident. I also have a lovely new nail file thanks to them!

Having arranged to meet friends, I had purchased a bottle of Disaronno from the local shop less than 3 minutes walk away, the bar staff were extremely helpful at helping me arrange ice and sliced lemons, quick and efficiently.
Catriona on reception, having booked me in on my first visit, was as helpful, friendly and happy as I remembered. Nothing was too much. It's lovely that a hotel as high calibre had a staff full of friendly, helpful and chatty members. Made me feel right at home.

I'm currently planning a visit in the summer with a large group of friends, potentially booking upto 4 rooms. I will definitely be staying here. Despite the significantly higher rates in the summer.

Thanks for a wonderful stay again everyone. Can't wait to revisit Belfast and stay with the Fitzwilliam team again.
",5,2014,02,25
226,First Class,"I stayed here for one night in February and it was an amazing experience.
From the minute you enter the foyer the staff in reception were so helpful and courteous.
We ate in the restaurant and the staff here were  excellent, Extremely friendly and efficient.
Our meal was beautiful.
The bedroom on the second floor was tastefully furnished .
The room was a little cold when we arrived but when I contacted reception there was someone up in less than five minutes. Brilliant service.",5,2014,02,24
226,Excellent,"Very much a proper 5 star hotel. Reception staff were very attentive on my arrival. Check-in was prompt efficient and friendly.  My room was lovely ; spacious, clean ,impressive and quiet. The lounge area was so nice with very comfortable and modern design. I didn't use the restaurant but the bar was good. An enjoyable experience in a hotel that I would well recommend. ",5,2014,02,24
226,Extended weekend break,"This was our first time at the Fitzwilliam hotel and we stayed in room 602 which was a deluxe double suite (6th floor) with great views of Belfast, could not fault this hotel, stylish, warm, comfortable bed and pillows which I consider a must, and over all friendly staff and clean. Although we had dinner resavations booked at different places, we did have breakfast at the Fitzwilliam which was very tasty and a modist selection which I like in a hotel (hotel breakfast's usualy annoy me with a basic range) so yes we are coming back here and we might try the pent house suite with friends as it looked flawless online.",5,2014,02,24
226,Good stay,"Recently stayed in the Fitzwiliam hotel Belfast for two nights.  Lovely room on seventh floor which meant that it was fairly quiet.  Staff were very pleasant on arrival and checkout.  Room large with lovely bathroom and good white company toiletries.  Very convenient location for Opera House, bus and train station, restaurants and shops.  We were very grateful for the complementary umbrellas for keeping us dry in the heavy Belfast rain.  Book well in advance for good deals.",4,2014,02,23
226,Comfortable Stay,"I stayed for 1 night at the Fitzwilliam recently.  The hotel is nicely situated being in central Belfast and close to a plethora of shops and restaurants.  My room was pretty well appointed and furnished, albeit slightly shabby in a couple of areas (only a minor criticism) and there was some road noise from outside (I was on the 4th floor).  I was very pleasantly surprised to find that the a/c system worked allowing me to cool the room to a comfortable temperature - most unusual in hotels in Europe during the winter months these days.  Breakfast was fine, but nothing really special.  Staff were attentive and pleasant.  Overall, a very comfortable stay, albeit slightly on the pricy side.",4,2014,02,22
226,Amazing. Worth the travel,The staff were very friendly and helpful when asked about places to go and see. The rooms were very nice and spacious. The location was perfect as we wanted to go see the shops and the city. It was also very convenient as is was only a few minutes from the bus station. Staff were very polite and made us feel like VIPs and looked to do it to all the guests. ,5,2014,02,21
226,Two nights in Belfast,"Ashamed to say I am 43 and have never travelled the two hours from Meath to Belfast. My wife and I were looking forward to a weekend away from the kids and Belfast did not disappoint. The Fitzwilliam is a fantastic hotel, a little expensive but worth it as a treat. Beautiful room. Great staff (particularly at breakfast and also the concierge who was a fantastic help). The breakfast is excellent and the bar is great for a beer and a cocktail. Good location in the city centre.",5,2014,02,21
226,Excellent service during High tea:) and outstanding,"I have stayed at the Fitzwilliam Hotel in Belfast a few times but had my first high tea today.  My blind Aunt celebrated with myself and cousin for her birthday.  i have to mention ""Brian"" who works in the bar and served us during high tea.   His service and attention was impeccable and I will give him a 10 - being in the customer service industry myself for over 30 years I have to say that Brian loves his job and gives detail and attention to his clients.  His caring attitude is exceptional which is rate these  days and I hope the hotel recognizes and appreciates him.  The Hotel is maintained extremely well and is immaculate.  The front end staff are also very friendly and approachable.  I'm from British Columbia - Canada and I will patronize this hotel again.  Thank you Brian for taking care of us today.

226,"Beautiful room, comfortable bed, elegant lobby, perfect location","Americans have high hotel standards and the fitzwilliam did not let us down.  The room is spacious, elegant, with a spectacular bed!  The lobby is very inviting and the staff is pleasant and accommodating.  Jimmy the concierge booked us wonderful dinner reservations and helped us pick excursions. Hotel is centrally located making a quick walk to Queens University and city hall.",5,2014,02,20
226,Our favourite hotel ,"Visited the fitzwilliam for the second time for one night on the 16th Feb for my girlfriend's birthday. we've stayed there before so we knew we liked the place. The room was fantastic, very comfy bed and delightful showering facilities. The toilet is a little high however. Thoroughly enjoyed my experience and if I wasn't a poor student I'd move in. ",5,2014,02,17
226,Outstanding!!,"The hotel was amazing from the moment we stepped through the door. The staff were attentive and polite. The room was impeccable and beautifully clean. I went down to reception to ask for more toiletries and dressing gowns and they were delivered up to the room before I was even back myself.

As it was valentines I also organised a rose to be delivered up to the room at 10am, and no doubt on the dot the concierge himself delivered it at 10:00 exactly. I had organised this with him on the sly and he was all too understanding and ended up doing it free of charge as a hotel kind gesture.

The bar staff were also excellent, serving us drinks in the evening which tasted fantastic.

By check out we didn't want to leave, they ordered us a taxi which arrived swiftly afterwards. 

The room was outstanding, shower particularly amazing and the bed was ginormous. I would definitely recommend to anyone to stay here again, its worth the money for the room and the staff make it all worthwhile. 

Outstanding!",5,2014,02,16
226,very pleasant stay,we stayed in this hotel for valentines and stayed in a studio room which was well worth the extra paid as it was very roomy. If I was to be critical of the hotel it would be that it would have been nice to have a spa  treatment for my wife  as we had planned to stay two nights but then changed our minds as we would have had nothing to do during the day.  We thought it was  a more  enjoyable than our  stay tin the Merchant,4,2014,02,16
226,Overnight stay,"My husband and I stayed before Christmas and we had a lovely experience staying in the hotel.Great location very comfortable rooms and good customer service.We would stay again in this hotel, great restaurants nearby.",5,2014,02,14
226,Special,"We have just returned from a 2 night stay in the Fitzwilliam for our 10th anniversary and it was amazing! The check in staff were really friendly and helpful and when we got to our room, there was a lovely personal note left from the manager of the hotel along with some cake for our anniversary. There was music playing softly for us, bath robes, slippers and water. The room was fantastic, spotlessly clean and the bed was huge and really comfortable. Also, we had the ability to control the heat or air conditioning to suit ourselves which was great.  There was also a great selection for free TV channels for us as well. The staff couldn't do enough to help us, from getting us extra pillows within 2 minutes at 11pm to arranging an umbrella for us to use while out shopping.  The express check out service is really handy for when you are in a rush or the reception staff are busy. Overall, we cannot recommend this hotel enough and can't wait to return. ",5,2014,02,13
226,fantastic!!!!,"Six of us went to this hotel on the 12th February 2014. We went for a pre-dinner meal...could not fault it!!Amazing!!Service was exceptional, Carolyn the manager is very attentive and this must rub off on her staff as they are all so good!!Well done on your 5 star service provided by your staff!!!
The meal was really exceptional!! Every course was so tasty, beautifully presented and lots of it!! Could not recommend highly enough we will be back!! The hotel is stunning I'm sure it would be a real treat to stay here!
Thank you",5,2014,02,13
226,A lovely relaxing weekend.,"I have just returned from a lovely relaxing weekend at the fitzwilliam. I was in Belfast for a friends 40th birthday party on Friday night. Check in was quick and friendly, the room was well decorated, with a lovely large shower and seperate bath. We decided to grab a quick main course in the hotel restaurant as we  were not sure what the food at the party would be like.We were amazed at the quality of the food and the lovely service in the restaurant, so much so that we ate there the second night.

The hotel is located right in the city centre, and is only 10 mins walk from Belfast central station which is great if you fancy a weekend without driving.

The bed in the room was extremely comfortable, in fact the whole hotel was very comfortable. I cannot wait to go back for another stay, this time with my partner.",5,2014,02,11
226,"Staff lovely, very clean, but expensive stay","Me and my boyfriend just stayed in the hotel I would not stay there again to be honest as much as the staff could not have been more helpful, staff were very pleasant. Room was gorgeous, very modern, extremely clean. The only bad thing I will say about the hotel is the hotel is not exactly cheap, it cost for 2 nights over 200 euro, u also have have to pay 17 pound a night on car parking which your not informed when booking the hotel, also the residents bar,you can't pay with cash after 11 you have to put credit on room to avail of the residents bar which your also not informed before you book .... Also I got charged an extra 50 pounds when I arrived that I did not know what it was for until questioned the charge when I was checking out which was for the residents bar or food ordered to the room. ",3,2014,02,10
226,Beautiful Hotel - 2 night stay,"Having stayed at 5 star hotels which have not came up to scratch, I was blown away by this hotel. From the lobby with ample lounge seating and trendy open fire to the rooms that had it all.  
The concierge situated at the front door are amazing. Top hats included, these guys will assist you with all your travel enquiries. My partner wanted to print off our boarding passes to come home and was allowed to use their laptop behind the desk !!! 
We had a hi-fi in our room as well as the TV with plenty of channels. 
The hotel is situated next door to The Opera House. You can get tickets for the tour bus across the street. Its not worth buying tickets for the city bus as you are able to walk around. 
The hotel Breakfast was lovely .... Cooked Irish Breakfast on day one and Pancakes with Maple Syrup on day 2. There is also continental breakkie with everything you could dream of to set you up for a day exploring. 
We ate in the bar one day and the food was first-class ( See pictures) The cocktails were fab although a little toxic :) 
I would definitely stay here again. I don't think any other hotel would come close to being as perfect as this place. Not one complaint. !!",5,2014,02,10
226,Great location,"I would recommend the Fitzwilliam to anyone staying in Belfast, it is very central to the town and next door to the Opera House. The rooms are clean, lovely comfortable big bed and I like that you have a stereo in your in your room so you can have some music when getting ready to hit the town. The bathrooms are well decorated. We had a food in the bar area which was very tasty, the house wine was very nice with a lovely atmosphere.",5,2014,02,08
226,"fantastic, relaxing break","I can't recommended the Fitzwilliam enough. The Deluxe room lived up to its name, fabulous views of the city and unbelievable bathroom. More than comfortable for an overnight stay. I had room service which was brought up in a timely fashion. The breakfast impressed me as he hit options were not buffet style and the range was wider than normal. All round the staff were helpful,and efficient in all aspects. It would be hard to give this anything else but 5 stars!",5,2014,02,05
226,Fantastic Stay,"We stayed here on 21st December 2013 for our staff night out, we had booked 3 rooms and we had dinner, bed and breakfast.  We received a lovely friendly welcome when checking in and they were very helpful throughout our stay.  The food was excellent and the service in the restaurant and bars were great too.  Great breakfast in the morning.  We would definately recommend to others and we will definately be back.  Keep up the good work.",5,2014,02,04
226,Very disappointing!! ,"We decided to stay in the fitzwilliam to celebrate our engagement! 
When we arrived at the hotel we were greeted at the check in desk with a very pleasant lady. Check in was very quick and easy and free wifi was available throughout our stay.
We then went to our room which we discovered was right opposite the elevator (very annoying noise the whole day and night). 
When we entered the room we tried to turn on lights and the switch was missing from the wall and hadnt been replaced. 
The bathroom door wouldnt close and there were alot of stains on the carpet.
There were also alot of chips out of the furniture (eg. Skirting boards..table..bed..doors..shelves..chair) 
The next morning we got up early to go out and do a bit of shopping. We never made the bed as we dropped some chocolate on the bed from the nite before on the bed sheets so obviously assumed the bed sheets would be changed.
When we arrived back to our room we discoverd that the bedsheets were not changed at all. 
That day we also noticed that we were coming out in bites and had to go and purchase anithistamines from the shop across the road. At this stage i just wanted to go home!!!
The next morning at check out, again the lady was very pleasant and quick with the process.

Overall i was disgusted with the standard of cleanliness throughout our stay!! Definately not 2 star standard never mind 5 star!!! 
",1,2014,02,03
226,Great short break,"Stayed for one night in Feb 2014. We arrived very early (9am) and our room was ready, which was a bonus. Spacious room although the heating was not working so we had to obtain a couple of heaters from the concierge. 

Comfy bed and nice bathroom. Breakfast was good too, nice buffet and hot food selection.

Reception staff were very friendly and check in was quick.

The hotel is located five minutes from City Hall and maybe 20 mins walk from the Titanic Museum, so very central for most of the attractions.",4,2014,02,02
226,Overnight stay,"Stayed here for one night on 01/02/14 with my boyfriend. I had purchased the accomodation via Expedia and got a very good room only rate.

The location of the hotel is very good surrounded by great bars, restaurants and shops. We attended a concert in the Waterfront & we managed to walk home...even with me in heels! It isn't as far away as it initally seems. The hotel does sit on a busy main road and it was quite noisy when trying to get to sleep but this was nothing that another cocktail couldn't sort out!

The main lobby was very modern and stylish. Check-in was dealt with by a pleasant receptionist and was fast & efficient. Our room was spacious & comfortable, as was the ensuite although I do think the accommodation will become 'tired' quickly as this was showing in some areas already, with one very noticeable maintenance issue in the bathroom which I reported during checkout and I'm sure the hotel will see that this is fixed immediately. I was disappointed that hair conditioner was not provided however the shampoo, shower gel and body lotion were all very nice. I was also surprised that no biscuits were provided with the tea & coffee and would've expected this in such an establishment. There was also coffee provided for use in a coffee machine...but only a kettle provided, which we found strange.

We spent some time in the hotel bar which is a lovely space to relax and provided a delicious, extensive cocktail list. The service was slow at times but that was understandable as the bar was full. It is obvious that the staff all work very hard.

I can't comment on the food as we didn't eat in the hotel at all.

Check-out was also very efficient and it was  nice to be able to check-in from 2pm and out at 12pm...longer hours than provided in most hotels.

Overall, I am giving the hotel 4 stars. The decor and general vibe of the hotel is fantastic, as was the service throughout but there is some room for improvement and all that is required is a little more attention to detail.

Oh, one last thing - the hotel offer valet parking at ¬£17 overnight but there is a McCausland secure car park across the road where you can park for ¬£14 overnight and when we showed them our receipt from the hotel, the rate was discounted to ¬£11.

",4,2014,02,02
226,Good and bad.,"Good -great central location
Lots of hot water and powerful showers
Very pleasant staff.
( especially Andrew in the bar and conceirge, Gerard)
Beautiful views of Belfast from the top floors
Bad - cold reception area
Room layout is not well thought out- tea/ coffee tray is in a cupboard without a powerpoint nearby
Breakfast was extremely disappointing.
I spent the previous weekend in a 3 star in London and breakfast there was better!

If  the hotel can improve the food, both quality and quantity, I would return.",3,2014,02,02
226,Fabulous Hotel ....but,"Would have given 5 stars if it wasn't for maintenance problems.
Stayed for three days and a warm welcome, the staff are happy and friendly going out of their way to help. This hotel has fantastic decor and ambience.
However, the pleasure of our superb stylish room was marred by poor maintenance problems. On reporting this we were upgraded in a immediately to a suite - this was a magnificent room but unfortunately had its own problems.  Such a shame as it reflected on our special evening out.
We were compensated but would rather have been able to enjoy our experience more.
I would most definitely return again though.",4,2014,02,01
226,Fantastic.,"Stayed as a couple 18th-21st. Service at the Fitzwilliam was polite, friendly and attentive, for example the receptionist asked upon checking in whether we required any directions or bookings, and the concierge provided us with a map and comprehensive walking directions. On our last day the receptionist kindly ensured that a taxi was booked ready to go the airport, having spent the day at the Titanic experience, whilst the concierge located luggage scales for us.

We didn't book DBB/BB so can't comment on the breakfast, but we ate in the restaurant one of the nights. The food price was fairly reasonable and the food itself was lovely. When we arrived at 7pm (weeknight), there was only one other table dining! I wouldn't say this was a bad thing, but we had been told to make sure we booked a table if we wanted to dine there as 'the restaurant gets busy'. Plenty of places to eat nearby if you don't wish to dine at the Fitz, and also a Subway and Tesco across the road if you want something on the go.

Toiletries provided by the White Company were really lovely. Thankfully the bathroom has standard lighting as well as 'mood' lighting! Was also even able to listen to the stereo/cd player (located in the bedroom itself) whilst in the bath (door open of course!). The bed was king size and incredibly comfortable.

The hotel does have a fitness suite and although it is small by any standards, but it has all you could need for while you're away (crosstrainer, bike, treadmill, freeweights, exercise ball, towels, water dispenser, air conditioning).

The hotel itself is in a convenient location for: city centre/city hall, War Memorial gallery, city sightseeing tour, crown liquor saloon (National Trust), Grand Opera House, and if you go the McCoombe's coach tour to Giant's Causeway (which I highly recommend! via Carrickfergus Castle, Bushmills Distillery, Carrick-a-Rede rope bridge), there is a pick up point a couple of buildings down the road, by the Europa.

We stayed on 2nd floor and our room was an executive with rear view, which we were fine with. I doubt you're at much of a disadvantage if you don't spend the extra to get a corner room with a view (superior/deluxe). Would certainly return.",5,2014,01,29
226,Christmas Package,"We were there from xmas eve to boxing day.
Reception staff were unhelpful and unfriendly on arrival and went to bar for a drink -similar experience. Had to ask for mulled wine and mince pies which were part of welcome package.
Room was lovely and great view over Belfast. Candle supplied in room but no matches available even at reception. Bathrobes tired looking and very little wardrobe space. Toiletries not replaced day2. restaurant staff pleasant at all meals - helpful and courteous but food not fresh or special.Housekeeping staff very pleasant. Christmas stocking on the door nice touch. 
lacked ambience and didn't feel christmasy or special. Obvious some of the staff didn't want to be there at xmas. Wouldn't recommend for xmas stay/package.
Not suitable for families with children. Wouldn't rate at more than 3 star.",3,2014,01,29
226,Short but Sweet,"Stayed here a while ago. Arrived late at night following a long flight and had a completely hassle free check in (which is always a plus!)

Room was stylish and comfortable, only downside was view of the bins (from on high) but i didn't spend anytime gazing out the window like in a travel advert so was not really an issue.

Had a couple of drinks in the bar which were good and enjoyed good conversations with the bar staff.

All in all a good stay.",4,2014,01,27
226,Brilliant stay,"Went for a trip with me and the girlfriend, had a great stay, amazing room and were made to feel so comfortable. However the highlight of the stay was the Fitzwilliam bar. Our server Andrew, Tall blonde fella, was the biggest gentleman I've ever met. He took care of us all night, and not only was our server but became our entertainment for the evening, very funny, charming and sweet. I will most certainly be back to the hotel very soon, and yous have Andrew to thank.",5,2014,01,25
226,Superb,"If you want to stay in a boutique hotel in the heart of the city centre then look no further. The floor to ceiling windows allow for bright rooms. The breakfasts, bar and ambiance are terrific. The only negative is that it is on a busy road.",5,2014,01,25
226,Incorrect Bill!!,"Hotel is not bad. Good location. However, I noticed some points unperfqect. 
At the mini-bar, there is no AC power for electric pot.
Mini-bar was locked.
Air-conditioner does not work at night. Room was very cold at mid-night and early morning.
Finally, bill was incorrect!! I never use mini-bar but some stuff was added in the bill.
I have to fight with reception guy.",3,2014,01,25
226,Very enjoyable stay in a great location,"I stayed 2 nights in The Fitzwilliam and was impressed.  Check in was efficient and friendly and I had a room on the 6th floor.  It did look straight across into another hotel room so I kept the curtains closed in the evenings.  Like a previous reviewer, the room was cold on arrival.  I decided to make a hot drink to warm me up, the selection was a bit limited (no hot chocolate) and no biscuits - and the only place I could find to plug in the kettle's tiny lead was the bedside table.  They were my only niggles.  The bathroom was great, the bed large and comfortable, the free Wi-Fi was good and the digital radio a nice extra on top of the television.
The location is very good with stacks of good restaurants close by.  Breakfast service was good and again very friendly.
The Concierge was extremely helpful too and I do hope that I'll be able to stay at The Fitzwilliam again sometime.",4,2014,01,20
226,Absolutely Fabulous Hotels in ALL Ways,"The Fitzwilliam Hotel Belfast ticks all the boxes from modern, well run and lovely friendly efficient staff - concierge/security, reception staff, accommodation staff, restaurant staff.
Everything is easy & relaxed.
The decor gorgeous and the rooms are really lovely - loved the mustard coloured sofa - my view was from 7th floor and was really lovely of a historical building and the hills in the background.
The location of this hotel is extremely central - close to all great shops.Loved Karen Millen boutique.
Valet parking is available so just pull in anywhere outside hotel or Opera House and the lovely concierge will park your car securelyaround the back and you can simply forget about the car and walk around the lovely centre. You may miss the hotel as the outside signage is easily missable. I recognised the F on the top of the building from their website but that was it - there is a sign over the door but I had driven by it before I realised - busy  area.
The Crown Bar is nearby - fab - as is Howard Street Restaurant & Flame Restaurant. Definitely visit the Titanic & St Anne's Cathedral Square with lovely cafes & restaurants.
I would definitely go back to belfast and this hotel.
Enjoyed my in room movies and a luxurious bath with seperate huge rain shower.
Loved every second of my holiday - oops business trip - felt like a treat.
Only one tiny thing - corridors are very dark  but I loved the mirrored doors.
Restaurant has no views or windows - so closed in feeling but Breakfast is great - vegetarian fry up with potatoe bread yummy.
Loved this hotel and area.
Thank you to all - 2 wonderful nights while working at Holiday World Show in Kings Hall (15 minute drive).",5,2014,01,20
226,"Modern, sophisticated and stunning","I stayed here for 3 nights on a recent business trip.  I usually stay in the Radisson or Malmaison so this was a first for me.  

From the outside it doesn't look like much, it has no grand entrance like the Europa a couple of doors down but when you get inside it does pack a punch!  Very modern and decorated beautifully.  The staff were friendly and helpful too.

THe rooms were high and comfortable, very very clean too and excellent tea/coffee facilities.  The king size beds were actually proper beds not 2 singles thrown together like many hotels so I had 3 amazing nights sleep.

Breakfast was exceptional also.  

Location is excellent, less than a 5 minute walk to City Hall.

I will request this hotel for my next business trip, highly recommend this, probably my favourite Belfast hotel next to the Europa!",5,2014,01,19
226,5* hotel for sure,"warmly welcomed, friendly staff and very helpful. reception area was fabulous, great lightening and a lovely open fire to sit infront of and relax. the room was luxury, high standard held. no damages to anything, perfect condition carpet, sofa and curtains. Bed was huge and very comfortable. the bathroom was spotless and the bath was great. I enjoyed the large bath, very relaxing  and my partner loved the powerful shower. Great hotel would defiantly stay again, worth the prices that you pay!",5,2014,01,19
226,Great hotel!,"I stay in the Fitzwilliam on a regular basis for business trips and wouldn't hesitate to recommend it to anyone visiting Belfast for business or pleasure. 

On arrival, the staff at the front desk are always extremely friendly and helpful, and the rooms are always spotlessly clean and comfortable. Breakfast is freshly cooked to order and never disappoints, and both the restaurant and bar menus are always delicious. 

The location is perfectly situated for walking to the shops, restaurants, and bars, and incredibly easy to find! The sightseeing bus tour starts from literally a 2 minute walk away and drops you off right back at the hotel. 

There are a couple of minor reasons for giving this 4 stars instead of five. The Fitzwilliam are very inconsistent in what you get in your room. Sometimes you get complimentary water, sometimes noe. It's the same with robes and slippers. The decor, although nice, is very dark, and the last thing is that if you are on the lower floors, traffic noise can be an issue if you are a light sleeper.",4,2014,01,17
226,Great Christmas stay,Booked family in for Christmas 2 day special with full works.  Christmas morning saw a stocking hanging on the door with some nice goodies. Nice touch!  Restaurant manager remembered our names from night before and greeted us with a warm 'good morning'. Breakfast choice very good and cooked fresh to order.  Christmas dinner was special and we never felt rushed. Evening Buffett was well presented and tasty (but still full up from our Christmas dinner). The hotel did a great job at looking after us. Only observation was that it was difficult to get near the open fire with other guests who had the same idea as us. A fireplace in the lounge would have given an even warmer feel to the place. Overall a very nice stay for those who don't have Christmas booked with relatives or who wish to meet up with family without the hassle of all the cooking!,5,2014,01,12
226,Great time had in Belfast,"Spent 2 days in this hotel as part of birthday celebrations, 1thing I would add that would have been nice would have been if a glass of wine/champers for celebration from hotel. Otherwise our stay was lovely. Rooms gorgeous and shout out too excellent polish barman that knew his cocktails!!!! Worth going for this experience:)",4,2014,01,11
226,Nice stay but a very disappointing breakfast.,"We enjoyed our stay at this hotel in mid-December, our room was lovely with a very comfortable bed.  The staff were polite and helpful and the hotel has a nice atmosphere.  It does feel like a luxury stay in some aspects but then in others I feel the hotel lets itself down.  The cooked breakfast is extremely disappointing, for ¬£12.50 you get one sausage, one rasher of bacon, one egg, 1 slice of potato bread and one tomato.  For ¬£12.50 I would expect much better than this, on top of the small portions the quality of food does not seem the best, the sausage in particular was quite tasteless and of poor quality.  Also a hot chocolate I ordered in the evening was clearly a cheap version with a watery chocolate taste and none of the small finishing touches you might expect like maybe some wipped cream/chocolate sprinkles etc.  I appreciate this is a small detail but I feel its the small details and finishing touches which make a hotel stand apart from others.  Based on our stay I do not feel the Fitzwilliam is hitting the heights that a hotel of this standard should be.

Additionally our shower leaked out all over the bathroom floor which we had to mop up with a towel each time.",4,2014,01,08
226,This is not a 5 star hotel.,"I have no idea why this hotel is 5 star. I stayed there last weekend. Staff were nice but a bit removed. The lobby is stylish but small. There really isnt much space to roam in the hotel so my 2 yr old son just walked up and down the hall outside our room, which is very dark. The room was okay, certainly nowhere near the standard of the other 5 star hotels ive stayed in. Breakfast was nice but there was a typo in the guest directory and it stated that breakfast is served until 11.30am on Saturdays and Sundays. This is incorrect so when we arrived down at 10.30 they were starting to finish up. We had to grab stuff off the buffet as they were taking it away. Not a great stay overall and definitely not for kids!",3,2014,01,08
226,Modern & stylish,"We enjoyed a one night stay in the Fitz, the hotel itself is very modern, with nice d√©cor.  We stayed in room 208, it had a large bed, nice bathroom, it even had a digital radio which I had never seen supplied before in a hotel. Everything you need is available.  The view wasn't much, we were located at the side of the building over looking another building, it would have been good to have had the main street few overlooking the main street life, but you pay the higher prices.  Location is perfect as it is right in the centre, amongst shops, bars & restaurants.
The lobby has a lovely fire which you can sit and relax, this sets the mood and creates an atmosphere - def in the cold winter months.
We enjoyed our stay, but didn't have the most pleasant experience in the hotel restaurant, as it didn't meet our expectations by far. Waiting time was lengthily and food wasn't 5star. This was very disappointing indeed.
We travelled by car, therefore needed to use the hotels car park, it was ¬£17.00 per night! I would consider returning sometime in the future, but perhaps booking room only.",3,2014,01,08
226,Close but no cigar!,"I stayed here for 1 night while I met the in-laws so wanted as simple a process as possible as I was nervous enough already. Thankfully this is exactly what I received, all the staff were polite and efficient in any requests I had and the room was spacious, bigger than the Mal Maison when I last stayed in Belfast. Only gribe was that the room was to dark as mood lighting seems to have overtaken functionality and the business centre may have been modern when Gordon Gekko was still king of Wall Street but is the equivalent to the Batcave, or in this case the roof, of the hotel!

Overall though a pleasant stay and I would come again. The lobby was nicely decorated to relax and the bar staff were excellent. For the price very good value for money.",4,2014,01,06
226,Beautiful hotel,"We stayed for 1 night for New Year's Eve, meeting friends for dinner in the evening at the Fitzwilliam restaurant. 

We were delighted with our stay. The bed is the biggest and most comfortable I've stayed in for some time and the hotel decor is modern and chic. 

The hotel was very busy but staff were always friendly and helpful. 

We had only 2 small issues when we stayed. One was that when we checked out the mini bar (one of those annoying electric ones that charges to your room as soon as you lift something) we found a half bottle of Sauvignon Blanc lying across the top shelf where some other drinks were meant to be! Worried that we were going to get charged for taking those bottles, we phoned reception and were told someone would be up to sort it out right away. No-one arrived after half an hour and we wanted to get some sleep before dinner so we put the do not disturb on and never heard from them again.   We weren't charged anyway when we left. 

The other thing was that the room was freezing when we arrived. I put the heat on straightaway but the room did not start to warm until the following morning. 

We ate a 4 course meal with ""champagne"" in the restaurant. The food was great and the waiting staff very helpful. I would consider eating here again. Disappointed though that the champagne was in fact Prosecco (and they forgot to give it to us, we had to ask at the end. 

When I started writing this review I had rated Fitzwilliam as 5* but having considered all these small things I've had to bring it down to 4. The rooms are beautiful and I would highly recommend. Just the few glitches taking away from it. 

One last thing. The NYE party was a bit pants. The ""evening entertainment"" advertised was apparently a DJ (who must have been hidden somewhere!) and who played a very strange set. Not what I was expecting. However, we had an excellent evening because of the company we were with, not because of the ""party"". 

I would definitely stay again, maybe at a less busy time of year to see if these niggles resolve.",4,2014,01,03
226,Christmas Lunch,"Just to point out that I am only writing a review of our Christmas Lunch at the hotel as I haven't actually spent the night.  

This year we wanted to do something different on Christmas Day for a number of reasons.  There were just four of us so we started looking early on to get something booked.  We booked a table for 4 for the three o'clock sitting which was ¬£80 for a 5 course lunch.

When we first arrived the hotel was lovely - really nicely decorated and we were greeted very warmly.  We made our way upstairs to the restaurant where unfortunately it was a little bit disorganised.  Our table wasn't ready so we had to hang about for a while but there wasn't really anywhere to go.  We were given a glass of mulled wine while we were waiting though.

When we did get to our table it was lovely.  We had been worried that the hotel might not be busy but it definitely was - there was a great buzz about the place. Our waiter was very friendly and helpful and we all ordered our starters and mains and a bottle of wine.  The first thing we received was an amuse bouche which on the menu was advertised as goats cheese and beetroot and I was really looking forward to it.  However, when it arrived it was just 4 balls which looked like they had been fried and they were just served on a little plate with a napkin - no nice presentation or sauce or anything at all. 

All of our starters and main courses were very tasty indeed and we had no complaints at all.  The portions were the right size, the flavours were good and we all really enjoyed what we received.

Then on the menu it said we were to receive a pre-dessert of lemon curd and pink peppercorn (I think) - however, we never received any pre-desserts.  We did all order desserts and then strangely our tea and coffee arrived with mince pies before our desserts.  Our desserts then did arrive and they were perfectly nice.  On the menu it said we were to get petit-fours so I am guessing that the mince pies were our petit-fours.  However, they weren't even home-made I don't think and were served on a plate still in their foil packaging.  I had expected that the chef would have made something really lovely for Christmas day for the petit fours.

Overall we had a lovely afternoon.  However, for the amount of money we paid for our meal I think it would have been nice to get the few extra touches.  I really enjoyed my starter and main and it was just a pity that the overall experience was let down by other small things.",3,2014,01,02
226,Exceeded expectations!,"We are just back from celebrating our one year anniversary where we stayed at this beautiful hotel.  We payed room rate only and from the moment we entered the hotel we were treated like royalty. The ladies at reception were brilliant and got everytjing ready for us really quickly. Upon arriving in our room we were greeted with a plate of chocolates and a card from the manager wishing us a happy anniversary. The room was spotless, warm, beautifully decorated and the bed was the comfiest. From start to finish we loved our stay here and want to thank all of the staff in the Fitzwilliam for making our one year anniversary amazing!already planning our next trip to you guys!",5,2013,12,31
226,Excellent Hotel in Heart Of Belfast,"One of the best hotels that I have stayed at. Every aspect of our experience at this hotel was excellent. The rooms are very modern, spacious and spotless. Reservations team very polite, courteous and professional, nothing seems to be an issue. Very central for visiting Titanic. Ideal location for shopping as everything is beside the hotel. Visit Deans seafood bar around the corner, best fish & chips! Overall, its a brilliant hotel, looking forward to returning...",5,2013,12,31
226,Great room and good value for money,We were celebrating our wedding anniversary and were upgraded to a corner deluxe room.  The accommodation was better than expected - stylist and large.  Even a proper King sized bed.  We would recommend the hotel and good value for money.,5,2013,12,30
226,Another Great Stay (4 out of 4),"I just finished my fourth trip to the Fitzwilliam (this one was for a week).  

The room is large, comfortable and modern!  The bathroom is large and spacious.  

The breakfast is terrific (much better than your usual buffet).  For a light dinner, try the seafood chowder (the room service charge is a lot however).

The service is always fantastic.  Jara at the front desk was great.  At their busiest time, she helped me to extend my stay one more day due to travel difficulties.  

Fitness room is small but first rate.  You may want to go at off hours.

It feels like home there.",5,2013,12,28
226,Lovely hotel,"We stayed in this hotel on 23rd December for one night. We stayed in one of the suites and were instantly taken back and how lovely and spacious the room was!!! The check in staff were lovely and were very friendly and helpful!! The lobby itself is gorgeous and is very welcoming! However there were a few cons- whenever we arrived we went to the bar to get some food. We got two bowls of soup which took a while to arrive and considering there were only two other people in the bar who weren't eating we thought this wasn't great service! Later that night we came back downstairs to the bar to get some dinner before going out and were told they wouldn't be serving food in the bar tonight as the restaurant upstairs was too busy!! 

Also the suite we stayed in was gorgeous but the bath was open and has no door etc and therefore if u were staying there with someone other than your partner could be a bit embarrassing!!!! Also there was no lock on the toilet door only a frosted screen which pulls across!! 

But this hotel is beautiful and is very luxurious!!!! Other than the evening meal in the bar situation I had a ball here and cannot recommend it high enough!!!!",4,2013,12,27
226,Beautiful hotel in Central Belfast,Stayed here recently for 3 nights. We stayed in one of the suites and the room really was beautiful - very modern and equipped with everything you could want! The hotel staff were amazing very friendly and accommodating particularly the bar staff. The food in the hotel is of a very high standard we dined in the restaurant in the hotel one evening and had lunch in the bar. Hotel is in a great location close to lots of bars and the shopping district! Really couldn't fault this hotel!,5,2013,12,26
226,Perfect Hotel in Belfast,"Not the first time we have stayed here, and on the basis of that visit we booked again. And I am glad we did. From the very first moment of our arrival on Christmas Eve night we were greeted with a friendly, knowledgable and smiling receptionist who was very welcoming. In fact, every staff member we came across, even wait staff we briefly passed at breakfast, was seemingly happy to be at work despite it being Christmas. Nothing was any trouble for anyone. 

The room itself was spotless, large and had the same cool design we'd experienced previously, and in excellent condition/repair. 

The bonus is the little touches: a fluffy Christmas stocking hung on our door handle with some lovely treats and a glass of champagne with breakfast thoughtfully suggested by our server. 

And that's why this is our number one choice when in Belfast. Simply cannot fault the place. Will return again and again.",5,2013,12,26
226,"Christmas Afternoon Tea....disappointingly, the scones are a lot smaller now!!","Two of us enjoyed a Christmas Afternoon Tea in the Fitz this December, for the third year in a row. We had an alcove table in the bar, and were served by a friendly young brunette girl. The afternoon tea offered a tasty range of sandwiches and sweet treats, with ample helpings of tea and coffee. The only downside I did notice is that they have switched from offering 2 lovely big scones per person to 1 TINY scone each! Quite disappointing, as I could have at least eaten 3 or 4 of these mini ones! In 2011 I paid ¬£22.50 for an afternoon tea for 2, but this year it was ¬£25, even though the food quantities had reduced. The christmas brochure actually quoted ¬£30 for 2, but the waitress only charged ¬£25...
All in all it will not stop me from returning next year, all being well, but it is just a bit stingey, especially for a 4* hotel! 
The christmas decor was, as always, beautifully chic, and the lobby fire and fairy lights make for a cosy place to relax a while, amidst the christmas hustle and bustle. 
The Fitz is definitely is one of Belfast's better assets, amongst the City's seemingly-endless grottiness.",3,2013,12,26
226,Belfast bliss,My wife and I stayed here last weekend of November . Great hotel central and walking distance from most attractions. Really great staff and a breakfast fit for kings. Super stay and highly recommend .,4,2013,12,20
226,My favourite hotel in central Belfast,"The Fitzwilliam is a real 4* treat, the staff are really friendly and I just love the modern but classic decor. Rooms and beds are great for a good night's sleep.  Breakfast is fantastic - eggs benedict with salmon and hollandaise sauce is spot on. A truly great hotel in central Belfast!",5,2013,12,20
226,The hyped one!,"I really enjoyed my stay at the Fitzwilliam! I was a guest for three nights and I have to say that I was quite surprised with the service. Staff in general and especially the one's at the reception and the concierge were beyond attentive. I really enjoyed room service as well however I must say that the highlight of the hotel is its location. Very central and not as ""crowded?"" as the Europa (the landmark). Overall I would go back as the decor is all artsy and made me think I was cool. Weaknesses? I would say maintenance because I saw some cracks in some of the furniture in my room and the bar service, its quite slow and even though the staff there is quite nice why not increase the number of staff?",4,2013,12,18
226,Not a 5 star experience,"Our stay in Belfast was to celebrate my sisters birthday so we decided to stay at this hotel as a special treat - we normally stay elsewhere. However we were very disappointed on our arrival when we found ourselves in a disabled room with no bath, walk in shower and raised toilet. When I phoned reception I was rudely told that's what had been booked so it was no fault of the hotel!! I did not book a disabled room so I think the hotel should be speaking with their booking agents because I see from previous reviews at least one other guest had a similar experience. Nothing was mentioned at reception when booking in, the surprise was when we entered our room - that can't be right. We were moved to another room on a lower floor which looked into some kind of quadrangle and directly into the window of another hotel room. The room was very dark and gloomy with inadequate lighting. The bathroom was also dark with a sink that took an age to empty.  The reception area was very nice and the quality of breakfast was very good - however the restaurant lacked any windows so after staying on the gloomy bedroom we couldn't wait to get outside. Certainly not a 5 star experience for us - we have stayed in cheaper and nicer hotels in Belfast.",3,2013,12,15
226,Great stay in an amzing city,"Loved every minute of our stay here. . From the valet parking to the breakfast staff , everyone was incredibly helpful, apart from one lady on checkout whom didnt seem tge least bit interest in my answer after she had asked me what I was doing for the rest of my day. She asked what I was doing and upon my reply she just tyed away on the computer with that look that you know that they are not interested. .

the breakfast is great. Possibly best set up I have seen on my travels. You have a buffet continental and a choice then of having a cooked breakfast brought to you as well. .

it was the room that really took our breathe away. From the second we entered it screamed quality.  Thick pile carpet, huge wardrobe,huge bathroom,sofa and the icing on the cake was the classical music that was playing on the little stereo system hidden away in the corner. 

Have being recommend ing the hotel since I got home to everyone that will listen..

thanks guys",5,2013,12,14
226,City break,"Really central easy to find hotel right in the city. Great welcome at reception, concierge very helpful my husband and I were impressed from the moment we were greeted.

The location is excellent walking distance to the city hall and the Christmas markets as well as all the main shops.

Great breakfast fast friendly service great food and so fresh quality very good.

All in all we were very happy and would recommend this hotel.",4,2013,12,14
226,Wow!,"Stayed here while having a night out in December.  The function was somewhere however when I experienced the Fitzwilliam we didnt want to go anywhere else. Bar great, staff amazing and rooms so comfortable. A special mention to Kevin, operations manager who made us feel so welcome. 

One word of advice.... JUST BOOK IT! Great hotel!",5,2013,12,14
226,Break the bank if you want to!,"Superb location, great colour schemes in the hotel. Probably a little pricey for Belfast to be honest, but it is a lovely hotel, if not a little empty when I stayed there! Hopefully it's picked up a little",5,2013,12,13
226,Lovely relaxing break in the heart of Belfast,Stayed here for 1 night for my Birthday. Enjoyed the whole stay; from the warm welcome to arriving in the lovely bedroom; pure relaxation all the way. Lovely cocktails by the fire in the lounge and dinner was beautiful too. Having the car parked up by the concierge was amazing. Will definitely do this again!,5,2013,12,13
226,"Lovely hotel, just need to work on a few minor points.","I stayed here for two nights, it was very close to the centre which was great, the rooms were well equiped whilst not huge they were big enough for what we needed.  We were in a room next to the lift and during the day you could here the bell in the lift and we worried that it was going to be noisy at night but that wasn't the case.
On our first night we went for a drink in the bar, we decided to take our drinks out into the reception area as the sofas looked a lot more comfortable.  The only table available had just been vacated by some people having tea/coffee and we expected this to be cleared at some point however we sat there for nearly an hour with our drink and the crockery remained.  

There was a large party sitting by the fire having tea/coffee and a birthday cake and when they left we decided to move over to the fire.  We got another drink and thought that at some point the big table that was covered in plates, cups and saucers etc would be moved but after we sat for another half an hour I went and asked if it was possible to have it cleared.

I think that more attention should be paid to this area as this is also the reception and first impressions count with people coming into the hotel.

Other than this, the breakfast was very nice and we had dinner on the second night which was also very nice.",4,2013,12,13
226,Loved it,"The staff were very friendly and helpful directed us to were we need to go. The rooms are big, bright, airy and clean. The Bar does amazing cocktails well worth a try. Will defiantly be re-booking in the near future.",5,2013,12,10
226,Friday Flit,"A great place to stay in Belfast, the room was spacious with great decor, a very chilled atomsphere and the staff were very friendly. There is a good atomsphere in the bar and it is a easy walk to anywhere in the city centre. hope to be back again!!",4,2013,12,10
226,First class,"This was my first stay at The Fitzwilliam and I would definately look to stop here again. Located very close to the bus centre (for the Airport bus), the city centre and several excellent places to eat. The staff were excellent from the moment I checked in, offering useful advice etc. The room size was excellent as was the bed and shower.",5,2013,12,08
226,Family Weekend Trip,We thoroughly enjoyed our stay at this very centrally located Hotel in Belfast. The Hotel is very modern and well presented. Concierge parking is very expensive and limited. The Hotel is located on a street corner and so drop off parking is very restrictive. We had a very nice evening dinner in the Bar  but were very disappointed with the service which was slow. The breakfast restaurant was however first class and the staff couldn't be more helpful. The bedrooms were large well equipped and very comfortable. Would recommend this hotel to anybody visiting Belfast for a holiday/shopping break which is just a few hundred metres off the M1 motorway.,4,2013,12,04

Location is good
Clean and smart 
Beautiful 
stayed for 1 night last week with my mother, we were up doing some shopping & sight seeing (titanic experience - a must!) we arrived early half 12 (had emailed to request early c/in), and they had a room ready for us. the room was fantastically decorated , as is the whole hotel... the hotel is only a 10 min walk to the city centre, shops etc. breakfast in the morning was lovely.. as we weren't leaving Belfast til the evening, we asked would they keep our bag for us which they did... which was great as we were going out for the day... would highly recommend the hotel, and cant wait 2 go back myself...",5,2013,12,02
226,Great room at a great price!,Enjoyed my stay here. Room very good quality and spacious. Quiet and didn't wake til 9.30! Staff very attentive even to the point of bringing takeaway chips to me at 1.30am! Cocktail bar ok but not wonderful. Queue for breakfast but we didn't wait as the hotel is well placed in belfast with lots of places to eat close by. Great price for night made whole stay overall very good!,4,2013,11,27

226,Luxury,"very nice hotel, great location in the middle of Belfast. right beside the Town hall for the Christmas markets and close enough that you're still in walking distance to Victoria shopping centre. the rooms was immaculate, very little road noise and we were in a corner room. extremely comfortable, food was great quality, service was only ok, the staff could have been quicker with seating us and taking orders.",5,2013,11,25
226,Not a 5-Star and Overpriced - Not value for money.,"Just back from a Saturday Night stay at this hotel....    Firstly would say that the Staff are excellent - very friendly, courteous and helpful.   The service at the Bar is VERY slow...    We ordered some food and cocktails at the Bar & they took over 45mins to arrive, we ordered a second round which again took forever...   The Barstaff kept apologising every time we asked by advising that the Bar was busy...  (The bar was not that busy with people....).   Then when food did arrive it was missing the sauces and sides as requested & then had to chase to get follow up on them & they finally arrived 15mins after the food.  The menu on the Pre-Booked Dinner rate is poor and certainly not 5-Star.    The Breakfast menu is also poor (limited choice) and in a 5-Star hotel Eggs Benedict should not comprise of 1 Poached Egg, 1 Slice of Cheap Packet Ham & and shop bought Muffin  (Very Poor).   Would agree with some earlier reviewers - overall experience is certainly not 5-Star and there are cheaper and nicer Hotels to stay in Belfast....",2,2013,11,25
226,Disaster from start to finish.,"Currently sitting at breakfast in the hotel. Had to wait to be seated only to be told by another member of staff that there loads of free tables. Ordered our hot food and was told that it may take some time to get out as they are busy, no problem. I said I would help myself to their continental selection in the meantime. There is nothing left and they are not putting out more! So I've just finished my 2 slices of watermelon and glass of orange juice! 

On arrival we were warmly greeted and asked if we'd stayed here before, we have at least 6 times as recently as September this year. We made our way to our room and when we walked in I knew it was different from our previous stays. The dirty ironing board was located at the side of a very out of place wardrobe, there were no cupboards either side of the bed housing minibar and stereo etc and no sofa! The penny dropped when my wife opened the bathroom door. We had been placed in a disabled room with lowered sink, no bath, no waterfall effect shower and a seat to sit on in the open shower! I phoned reception and explained the situation and was rudely told that I had paid the lowest rate and therefore had been placed in an ""accessible"" room. I was told a manager would call me promptly as I had theatre tickets for a 7.30 show! A manager called back and contradicting her colleague explained we had paid a higher rate to avail of an ""accessible"" room! She apologised and said she would take ¬£60 off our bill after much arguing with her, taking it from ¬£180 to ¬£120!
The next morning when we used our open shower complete with seat, the bathroom flooded! The draining does not clear the water quickly enough and must only be designed for a 5 minute max shower. Hardly acceptable for someone in a wheelchair!
Back at breakfast and our hot food has arrived. They have gotten my wife's order wrong but it is quickly remedied! We have had to take milk and butter from the table beside us as we haven't been given any! The quality we have found here in the past has faded away. We were always happy to pay a high price for high quality but it appears that quality has fallen by the wayside!! Last night they were fully booked and it appears their profits are not being put back into the hotel to maintain a high standard! 
Looking forward to checkout....",1,2013,11,24
226,Gorgeous!,"Stayed here last month with my boyfriend, staff were friendly and welcoming, which made the stay even more pleasant! The meal was beautiful and the steak was cooked to perfection. The bed was extremely comfortable, and decor is really up to date and modern, just the way I like it! Will definitely be staying here again (sometime soon hopefully) and would recommend to anyone!

226,Brilliant,"Stayed here on business and have to. say this is an excellent hotel! Staff were great and so too was the service, at reception, in the bar and the restaurant. Dined in the restaurant and had the early evening meal deal which was not only delicious but also really good value for money. Drinks were a fair price, I didn't feel ""mugged"" as I often do at other hotels.
The hotel itself is excellent and my room, which was a standard one was top notch! Definitely stay there again, well done to all at The Fitzgerald.",5,2013,11,19
226,Fabulous!,"My sister and I have just returned from a weekend stay in the Fitwilliam Hotel. It was a fabulous experience - the staff here are excellent, so friendly and could not have done more to make our stay as comfortable as possible. Declan the concerige took care of all our requests, from booking us a resturant in the city to our city tour. Melissa on front desk was so friendly and could not have been more helpful. Breakfast, Drinks and atmosphere was excellent all round. We will be returning. I would highly recommed a stay here :)",5,2013,11,19
226,An Excellent Hotel with Excellent Staff,"Just back from a really relaxing weekend break in the Fitzwilliam and thought I owed it to the great staff to write a review to show our appreciation for great customer service, great atmosphere and overall a brilliant hotel.

The hotel was very stylish and the room had everything we needed for a relaxing weekend. The bathroom had a bath and shower and the whole hotel throughout was spotlessly clean and the staff were very attentive to our needs. The receptionist on arrival made us feel so welcome and ensured that we were familiar with the hotels facilities and times for breakfast/dinner as it was our first time staying here.

On the second day we went to the bar for a few cocktails after going shopping and we were wowed by the extensive range of classic cocktails and other more rare cocktails made with premium spirits. They were absolutely amazing and I cant wait to get back to get some more. The Old Mule Skinner was my personal favourite!!

If I had some constructive comments it would be to choose a different time to sort out the bar bottle bins. Our room was at the back of the hotel so we assumed it would be quiet, however each morning between 8-9am the sorting of the glass bottles from the bar woke us up, even though our room was on the 5th Floor.

We had a great time! This Hotel is an asset to Belfast!

Well Done Fitzwilliam we will be back in the near future!! Keep up the outstanding service!",5,2013,11,19
226,great afternoon spent here,My husband had afternoon tea today in this hotel and what can I say it was a wonderful experience. The staff and the service was great. The barman even made me a cocktail that wasn't on your list. What can I say a great afternoon spent here and will definitely be back for afternoon tea,5,2013,11,19
226,Very Welcoming,"This was our first visit to Belfast so I selected a central hotel to make getting around easy and the Fitzwilliam Hotel certainly met the brief.  However, it was the extras that made the stay so special.  The first welcoming hello at Reception set the standard and all staff met or exceeded that standard each and every time.  The room was very clean and comfortable, large enough for 2 people not to fall over each other.  The bathroom provided all the necessary requirements and was thoroughly cleaned each day of our 3 day stay.  The WiFi connection was easy to work and preformed as expected.  

We visited the Restaurant twice once for breakfast and the second time for dinner.  On each occasion we were warmly welcomed and all our requests were provided in a timely manner to an expected standard.  At dinner we explained we were attending a show and our meals and bill were present within amble time and we never felt rushed.  The food and the service was top notch.

Overall our stay at the hotel was as it should be, a comfortable welcoming non-eventful experience which allowed us to do what we came for and enjoy our time discovering Belfast.  Thank you and well done management and staff of the Fitzwilliam Hotel.",4,2013,11,18
226,Grand Opera House,"Booked this hotel as it was right next door to the Grand Opera House where we where dwn to watch CATS

226,Amazing experience,"My husband and I decided last minute to take a night away in belfast and booked into this hotel, we'll wat can I say from the min we arrived we were very impressed got an upgrade to an executive double room ""beautiful"" we have stayed in quite a few hotels in belfast and this was by far the best one, we will defiantly be back.",5,2013,11,18
226,Service at bar the worst ever,"I have just returned from an overnight stay at the Fitzwilliam, hotel. The location is great, reception staff were lovely and efficient and rooms were luxurious if a bit small. We booked a table at the bar and explained that we would like to have something quick and light to eat with a few drinks before we headed out. There were 10 of us, we sat down at 8pm, 2 HOURS later we were still waiting on the bill!! We ordered a mix of salads, chicken wings, chips, sandwiches etc. 3 dished needed to be sent back, and still not replaced after 20minutes. waited over 15 minutes for one cocktail to arrive, one sticky toffee pudding with tea was ordered, tea arrived and after asking 3 more times! the pudding arrived, 4 coffees were ordered, 2 arrived, 10 minutes later 2 more arrived!! It was a joke, the service or lake of it was so bad all we could do was laugh. But it did put a damper on our one night away, we were given a 30% discount on our bill after complaining but it has put us all off ever staying at this hotel again. I have to say we had a lovely breakfast the following morning in the restaurant and the service was spot on, but please Fitzpatrick get your bar staff up to speed there letting your hotel down badly.",2,2013,11,18
226,Friendly staff make this a Very Good Hotel....,"Neither M (my ""Better Half"") nor I had stayed here before, so on a trip which was a mix of business and pleasure we decided to treat ourselves, influenced (as usual) by Trip Advisor reviews. Our conclusion ? This is a Very Good hotel definitely rating 4*s, but not quite deserving 5 !

After a smooth and pleasant train trip from Dublin, we endured a (mercifully) brief cab-ride from Belfast Central - our Driver was surly, unhelpful with luggage and certainly shouldn't be recruited as an ""ambassador"" for Belfast hospitality (which happily was otherwise excellent throughout our stay) ! We got a warm welcome at The Fitzwilliam - our immediate impression was that this hotel has a very modern feel to it - perhaps a bit ""clinical"" ?

Next, to our (de-luxe) room. Travelling to the 4th Floor, we had a short walk down a dark d√©cor but reasonably wide corridor, entering a similarly dark-shaded bedroom. The room itself was fine - two walls of glass, good size, large bed - but wardrobe space was VERY poor, and shelf-space for toiletries etc. in the Bathroom was extremely disappointing. (Whoever did the Bathroom layout also overlooked how easily you could bang your head against the towel-rack but happily no serious damage was done !)

As we had ""time to kill"" before our Business Function in the evening, we repaired to the ground-floor to order tea & scones. As with many parts of the hotel, this is an area of ""hard surfaces"" so the raucous ""music"" at an intrusive volume level was not particularly pleasant, and hardly appreciated by a clientele which to our eyes was most unlikely to look for ""disco style"" noise in mid-afternoon ! Tea + scones were fine and fairly priced, but unlike most of the staff we met during our stay, the Servers here were not as focused on the customer as they should have been, sadly lapsing into the ""talk to each other"" trap more frequently than would impress.

We enjoyed a great night at our Function, returning to our Room and surprised at the fact that there had been no ""turndown"" as we had expected from an hotel which pitches itself at a certain level (for us, the big gain from a ""turndown"" service is that fresh towels are delivered). Sleep quality was reasonable, but certainly from a 4th Floor perspective, there's quite a bit of traffic noise....

The morning after ? The 2 newspapers we ordered were sitting outside the door as we emerged at 8.30, and we were well-received when we reached the eating area : we were particularly impressed that our ""Greeter"" asked ""have you had Breakfast with us before ?"" rather than instantly launching-into a spiel about the Breakfast routine. D√©cor here is again a question of taste : hard surfaces, quite screamingly red upholstery with (again) hard surfaces - 'sorry, but for us it was a bit ""caf√© like"" !

The Breakfast itself was good but not great - the fruits / cereals / other items buffet was O.K. but not spectacular, the coffee was just about 1 grade above ""instant"", but the ""cooked"" part was quite good. What particularly ""jarred"" was again the intrusive ""music"" but above all, for an hotel at this claimed level, the ""Do-it-Yourself"" toast facility ! Being fair, all of the staff we met were extremely pleasant and attentive (a point we noted throughout our stay at ""The Fitzwilliam"") but I honestly can't argue with M's assessment to the effect that ""Breakfast was quite ordinary""....

Breakfast on the second morning of our stay was slightly better - helped by the attention we got from an absolutely wonderful Server, Patricia - personable, helpful, effective, no-nonsense - plus the fact that the crazy intrusive ""music"" had apparently been turned-off !

As we moved towards our departure from ""The Fitzwilliam"", having listed reasons why the hotel does not, in our view, merit a 5* rating, we also reflected on significant ""positives"" and decided they mainly revolved around staff. In the main, all staff were friendly and attentive - we were especially impressed by Catriona (great problem-solver !) and Melissa on Reception, and a young Concierge called Philip, and the Accommodation (Housekeeping) staff we dealt with were great !

Would we come back to ""The Fitzwilliam"" ? Possibly - and if we did, it would be because of the positive effort of the staff members we came across on our most recent visit.",4,2013,11,17
226,"really enjoyable, fantastic birthday!","Went here with 4 friends, my auntie and my mum for my 21st birthday, we did a cocktail masterclass. It was amazing! We were given a private room on the 9th floor with views all over Belfast. Dave, the bartender looking after us, was friendly, funny and brilliant. We got lots of info on the history of cocktails and made our own, we had great fun.  Afterwards we were given free cocktail passes to take down to the bar, which was a great added extra. We also had a small snack, which was beautiful duck rolls and bruschetta.  Couldn't beat it, was a fantastic 21st birthday!",5,2013,11,17
226,Lovely stay,"One of the best hotels I've been to this year! Decor really nicely done, room a good size, and bed was very comfy. The only downside was funny positioning of the powerpoints (had to hunt for a place to plug in the kettle) and the seal on the shower needed replacing as water tended to spill out all over the bathroom floor. 

We ate at the bar one night and food was good an reasonably priced, service friendly. 

Hotel is conveniently located for city tour buses and Giant's Causeway tour. Overall a really great stay.",4,2013,11,16
226,Amazing!,"This was our first time to Belfast and I couldn't rave about this hotel more. The hotel is in a fantastic location right in the middle of everything and only a 5 minute walk to Victoria St shopping district.
On arrival the concierge parked our car and we walked into a gorgeous reception area with an open fire.
Check in was really quick and we were informed that we had been upgraded to a suite. We were thrilled.
The corridors in this hotel are quiet dark but I liked it.it created atmosphere. We were staying on the 8th floor. All the doors had a mirror on the outside which I found bizarre but for some reason it fitted in with this hotel.
The room was gorgeous. Huge bed,beautiful decor,all open plan,double shower. It also had a huge floor to ceiling window that had an amazing view of the city. In the room there was chocolates waiting for us and a personal note from the General Manager welcoming us to the hotel, which I thought was a nice touch.
We had lunch in the bar which was delicious. Bar is a bit strange tho, it looks very swanky but a lot of the seating is in booths which I found did not go with the rest of the decor. Other than that the bar was lovely.
We were only there for the one night but we wished we were staying longer.
Have to compliment all the staff in the hotel as they really did make us feel so welcome and were more than helpful. Will definitely be returning to this hotel and eating there as the restaurant menu looked delicious.",5,2013,11,16
226,Delicious Luxuriousness,We have stayed here twice. We love the atmosphere and the decor. The Belfast Fitzwilliam is much better than the one in Dublin as the rooms are bigger and the decoration is much more stylish and chic (Dublin has balconies over looking St Stephen's Green though) We have not eaten in the restaurant but we probably will if we stay here this New Years and we're looking forward to it as we have heard it is very good. The receptionists are always welcoming and pleasant. My only complaint is that the bar man who served us the last time we visited had a bit of an attitude problem and served me a drink which was 3 months out of date! We didn't let this spoil out stay though. Thoroughly recommended!,4,2013,11,14
226,Brilliant,"One word 

Brilliant !!!!

This hotel is such a beautiful modern hotel in the heart of the city the food is absolutely fantastic ! And the breakfast absolutely delicious can not wait to return next year! ",5,2013,11,13
226,"If the cap ""FITZ"" wear it","Pulled up in my car outside this hotel on a busy friday tea-time ,some bloke with a top hat joyrides off in my motor and parks it for me! Great service with a smile ,parked my car and let me go book in.
Hotel was packed and rooms big,bright and comfortable.
Went to the bar later after a show and the celebrity cast of series four ""Game of Thrones"" were larging it.
Good food good craic and good company.Would definitely stay here again.",5,2013,11,13
226,No fruit????,"Went for a meal at The Fitzwilliam. Service rather poor and shoddy. No attention to detail. Wine ""sloshed"" into glass- if it went into the glass!!! Food good I have to say. Organized to go to ""cocktail"" bar for drinks. NO cocktails. Ran out of fruit by 1030pm. Really really poor. We had booked for a VERY special occasion and were really disappointed by this. Had to go elsewhere for cocktails. Can The Fitzwilliam really afford to throw away business???",3,2013,11,09
226,Great break in Fitzwilliam Hotel,"We stayed here from the 31st Oct to 2nd November and really enjoyed the experience. The staff are all courteous, professional and go out of their way to make your stay really comfortable. We had a four course meal included in our package and were very impressed with the variety of dishes on a set menu. Breakfast was lovely and breakfasts are cooked fresh which we felt was better than a buffet. 
The hotel is in a great central location to explore the city and we would highly recommend a visit.",5,2013,11,08
226,Classy Hotel in great location,"Stayed here on a business trip so I can't comment on the value.

However, rooms are very comfortable and finished to a high standard. Breakfast selection and service was excellent - couldn't fault it in any way. Location is ideal for central Belfast - most places of interest are within walking distance.",5,2013,11,05
226,Oasis of calm,"Having spent 3 weeks on our road-trip, we walked into our room at the Fitzwilliam and were immediately gratified at the decor of the bathroom with its glorious shower, and the spaciousness of the bedroom.  The quiet room restored our equilibrium, so that we felt eager each day to head out and explore our surroundings.",5,2013,11,04
226,Excellent stuff,"Stayed here over the weekend - Friday 1st November to Sunday 3rd. Had a wonderful stay, staff were so friendly and were so helpful in everything they did, from giving directions, arranging our black cab tour, checkin/out, etc. We're staying in a suite on the 8th floor and the room was fabulous.

We had dinner in the hotel on our first night and it was lovely, although I thought it could have done with one more choice per course on the B&B+Dinner message. The restaurant staff were very friendly and helped us choose a lovely bottle of wine with our meal.

The only point of dissatisfaction I've with our stay is the 3 egg omelet choice for breakfast .... way too salty. I sent one serving back requesting another with a lot less salt and the second serving, while not as bad there were still mouthfuls where all you can taste was salt.

But in saying that this did not effect the overall impression of our stay at all ... I forgot to mention it on checking out. This is an excellent hotel and would love to come back again. Didn't give it the full five stars as I generally ignore those reviews myself.",4,2013,11,04
226,Excellent Hotel,"I love this hotel. We have  stated here often and are never disappointed. The staff bring us back - simply excellent attention to detail. 

The food is very reasonably priced and just fab!

The rooms are very fine.

Def be back to this hotel in the middle of Belfast.
",5,2013,11,01
226,Enjoyed this hotel,Good room although small. Breakfast was very very good in a lovely setting. Staff were mostly courteous however a staff member in the bar where we were going to eat was quite sharp with us - appeared a bit stressed - we would have come back later but he did not give us a chance to say that - just did not listen! so we went to the Europa instead. Very clean room and with nice toiletries. Sitting/ lounge area is lovely. TV stations seem to be limited and poor. Overall a nice stay for one night. Staff would be best to consider how they treat people - they never know what they have been through - and to cover up their stress with patience!,4,2013,10,31
226,Excellent location,I booked online and followed up with a phone call regarding valet parking. The receptionist was courteous and helpful. On arrival our car was parked for a small extra charge payable upon departure . The room was clean and comfortable. Breakfast was included and although the cooked breakfast was not plentiful it was tasty. We will return.,4,2013,10,28
226,Very pleasant short stay,"We booked a night including breakfast. We had stayed in the hotel before and were happy to return. The hotel is well situated in Belfast, with good restaurants within walking distance ( We went to Mourne Seafood which we thoroughly enjoyed). We asked for a quiet room and received one on the fourth floor away from the elevator as requested (415). The room was well laid out  with modern decor. There was a large bathroom with a large bath and separate walk in shower. 

We had a drink in the bar which was nice and the service was good. There is a nice lobby in the hotel with an open gas fire and a good seating area.

Check in and check out were both efficient with friendly and polite staff. 

The only more disappointing aspect was the breakfast which was ok ... good fresh fruit, ok but not great eggs benedict, poor coffee.  Overall a very pleasant stay. We will stay again in the future hopefully.",4,2013,10,28
226,Upscale and Well Situated Hotel,"We stayed in The Fitzwilliam Hotel on a tour of Ireland and of all the hotels we stayed in, it was my favorite.  It is well situated in close proximity to pubs, shopping, City Hall and the Opera House.  The rooms were quiet, well appointed and very attractive and the bathroom was nothing short of stunning.  

The room was of modest size, but was laid out in such a way to make good use of the space.  
As we entered our room, there was black cabinetry that held the refrigerator (a stocked fee-based mini bar) and electric kettle for coffee/tea service.  Electricity was turned on by putting your room key in the slot inside your door.  In the darkness of night, the black cabinetry immediately ahead of you as you entered the room was a bit like entering a black hole.   As you made a left, the bathroom was ahead, on your right.  Ahead of that was the bedroom.  

There was a green sofa on the wall across from the foot of the bed.  A long black table topped with glass served as a work station and vanity.  There was a closet with two doors next to the bathroom that held a rod for hanging clothing, the safe and two wide drawers that were not very deep.  This was sufficient for our two night stay, but might be a challenge for clothing storage if your stay is longer.  

The decor of the room was black and white with a touch of light green.  The wall behind the padded green headboard was black wood and the bedding was white with a a runner that was placed diagonally across the food of the bed that was green and black.  There were black and white checked rectangular pillows that I fell in love with and would have loved to take home as a souvenir (and I can't help but wonder how many of those the hotel loses each year to such impulses).  There were two reading lamps and 2 recessed ceiling lights hanging above the headboard of the bed, providing great reading light.  

The black and white theme was continued in the bathroom, which was gorgeous.  There was a pedestal sink, an enclosed shower and a tub that held a little candle in a glass - I only wish time and energy had allowed more use of these amenities.  

The lobby area had several very appealing sitting areas, some with a fire.  Everything about the hotel was quite nice.   I would recommend this hotel to anyone looking for accommodations in Belfast.  We went to the Crown Pub that is located on the block (across the street) at the recommendation of our tour director and not only was the food good, but the interior is well worth seeing for the decor.",5,2013,10,27
226,Contemporary styled luxury hotel,"We stayed for one night in a superior room with breakfast included. The room was big and had a window area that overlooked the main road. We were on the fourth floor and had no noise disturbance from the hotel restaurant or road outside, it was a peaceful place to watch the world go by. The room included everything you'd expect; king sized bed, good quality linen, TV, hostess tray, iron & board, safe, pen & paper, toiletries. There was a well stocked mini bar and a CD player with clock radio and remote control which was a nice touch. The room also had a good sized sofa and table in it and wine glasses provided. We appreciated the cafetiere and filter coffee sachets and for tea drinkers there was a pot. The bathroom was big with a generous sized bath tub and separate drench shower. Everything was clean and well maintained and of a high standard. 

Our breakfast in the restaurant in the morning was of a similar standard. There was a wide selection of continental items to choose from and the option of cooked food also. I had the maple syrup pancakes - a little dry for my taste but pleasant all the same. My husband had full Irish breakfast with white pudding instead of black pudding (which was also available if desired). He felt everything was well cooked and good quality. 

The hotel is virtually next to the bus station (15mins bus ride to City airport), centrally located for exploring the city and is not too far from the University and Botanical gardens and Ulster Museum. I'd stay here again.",5,2013,10,26
226,Charming decor and staff,"About what one would expect for the money.  Beautifully appointed and modern in design.

Opera House right next door and a choice of eating establishments all within walking distance.

Hotels greatest asset is the staff. Each employee appeared to genuinely value the guests: Professional without being pretentious; Accomodating ; Proficient.   

Good times...
",4,2013,10,26
226,Not good value.,"I wouldn't consider my stay here last month good value.  The place is becoming, in my opinion a bit dated and is overpriced.  There are plenty of better options for somewhere to stay in Belfast.

Food poor, drink mediocre, room basic...",2,2013,10,23
226,restaurant has wow factor but too hot,"Had pre theatre dinner in the fitzwilliam hotel last night. Had a drink in the bar downstairs first. Nice window booth for people watching. Bar reminds me of being onboard an easyjet flight. Long and easyjet orange. Headed upstairs to the restaurant, busy for a tuesday night. Lovely booth, comfortable but so very hot... need a bit of air conditioning. We had 2 course pre theatre menu, chilli chocken for starters, delicious. Pan fried chicken on a bed of creamy champ for mains. Very morish. Service great, staff very attentive and friendly. Really enjoyed my evening, only complaint was the heat, it got very uncomfortable. When we got outside a gulped in a few breaths of good fresh belfast air it revived us. Overall really lovely and will be back",4,2013,10,23
226,"Great hotel,  great staff","We booked a room and breakfast for an overnight stay. Checked in fast and without difficulty. They had all irrevent documents to hand. 
Corridors leading to rooms are beautiful. Thick pile carpets, dim lighting, mirrored doors. 
We were staying in an excutive suite which was beautifully decorated. 
Breakfast was top notch,  continental buffet style selection whilst waiting for our freshly cooked full irish breakfast. 
Will definitely stay here again :)",5,2013,10,22
226,Excellent Hotel,"Reception and concierge staff were very friendly and extremely helpful.  The room was very modern, in good condition and very spacious.  Only downside was the bar which was very sterile with absolutely no atmosphere.
      ",5,2013,10,22
226,Brilliant hotel,"Loved this classy hotel with excellent service! Ace location bang central, food was gorgeous I had the salmon and noodle reasonably priced :) bathroom was beautiful beds were very comfortable, very happy customer will return ",5,2013,10,20
226,Nice but not a 5*,"Great location, across from Robinson's & the Crown, easy 10 minute jaunt into city centre. Room was nice, especially the bathroom except the shower was very slippery - I took my life in my hands each time I used it. This hotel must have good liability insurance because someone is going to get hurt - the hallways are ridiculously dark & the carpet was bunched in many spots. The breakfast is not worth the 16.50 at all. I had dinner in the bar one night & it was very good & the server was great (blond woman, I forget her name :( but she was very friendly & professional)",4,2013,10,20
226,Excellent location in this very interesting city,"The hotel was very welcoming, ideally situated near all attractions, very helpful staff, particularly the Concierge who helped us with tickets for the bus tour. The breakfast was very good with plenty of choice and the hot food was cooked to order. The bedroom was very comfortable with good sized bath and large walk in shower. We didn't see all we wanted to see in the 2 days we were there and would definitely return to this hotel.",5,2013,10,20
226,Belfast,"Stayed for  four nights in this hotel fantastic, staff were so helpful my wife being in a wheelchair nothing was too much trouble, the restaurant staff were so helpful room service was good, the only problem was in the centre of belfast all the pubs that had restaurants were upstairs and we couldnt use them that is my only gripe with the whole belfast experience, we really enjoyed our selves.",5,2013,10,19
226,Ultramodern hotel in downtown Belfast,"Our room at the Fitzwilliam was extremely comfortable and roomy.  Fantastic bathroom with bathtub and shower and big bedroom with very comfortable bed.  We did not hear any noise from outside as others have stated.  Great location near pubs and shopping.  As other reviewers have said, parking is not available and having to park on the sidewalk to get out your suitcases is a bit of a pain, but the valets are very helpful.  We had breakfast served to our rooms every morning and it was delicious.  Also had dinner at hotel first night and it was very good.",4,2013,10,16
226,great hotel,"I spend two nights at the Fitzwilliam. The rooms were fantastic, as was the food at the hotel. We spend an evening at the late bar and have to mention the bar man Jonathan who in particular was a great credit to the hotel. His cocktail knowledge was extensive, and friendly manner made our evening.

I wouldn't hesitate to stay here again and look forward to returning.",5,2013,10,15
226,Noisy,"Difficult to park, as its valet parking-so you have to empty your car on the street and then check in. No self access to your car. Valet has to retrieve it. 
Outside Noise was the biggest problem. I cannot understand why such an expensive hotel does not double or triple glaze its windows. After a very broken nights sleep due to the traffic noise we were woken for good at 7am by a Jackhammer outside the hotel. Rather nasty experience. 
We were on a short holiday trip to Northern Ireland and would NEVER stay here again. Far too expensive for a terrible nights sleep.",3,2013,10,15
226,Great stay with only 1 or 2 minor complaints,"Stayed here in August. Great hotel, inside was lovely, all staff very helpful, and food was great.

My gripes came from the bar, cocktails were not great for the price, felt like I was drinking from a petrol tank not a glass with the alcohol fumes. 
In addition, the tv??? Why is there only like 6 or 7 channels? Maybe it was just our room im not sure.

Otherwise great stay, lovely bed etc and good sleep.",4,2013,10,14
226,"Stunning Room, great Stay ...ty","Awesome room upgrade, thank you Fitzwilliam, it was my girlfriends birthday and we were upgraded to a corner suite. I have travelled extensively and have to say this room was up there with the best across the globe. Love the bath in the room, she drank wine and bathed watching tv, I watched the same tv, laying on the bed, great concept! Thank you for being so kind and attentive with your service. The local knowledge was brilliant, the hotel is ideally located, you can walk to nearly everything worth a look at, highly recommended.",5,2013,10,13
226,Gamorous location,"Stayed here two nights. Check in smooth and efficient. Classic FM soothingly playing as I walked in. Very chic back and green room-all mod cons and large bathroom with bath and shower-shower hot and powerful. Very clean and tidy!
Staff unfailingly charming and very eager to help.
Agree with other reviewers about little things! Tea/coffee tray fine but had to plug kettle in by bed to make a drink which was a bit odd. Please can you provide a jug of fresh milk not that horrible UHT nonsense!!!
Bar busy and noisy but cocktails dandy. Breakfast fabulous lots of choice and great service.
Concierge a big plus-great directions and help with printing off pesky Flybe boarding passes.
Hotel lovely and quiet at night despite the mayhem down the road. Free WIFI makes it all very easy to get around and stay in touch.
Would suit a romantic break for two-I was with my sister in law and we had a great time doing the Titanic/Crumlin Road gaol!",4,2013,10,13
226,Brilliant City Centre Location,"I stayed in The Fitzwilliam for work last week. It is so central and the Concierge parked our car for us so whilst I was working, my other half could enjoy the sights of the city. The staff are really friendly, lovely rooms, fab bathrooms and tasty breakfast the next day. Will happily go back and stay on a personal basis for the weekend.",5,2013,10,13
226,Brilliant Customer Service,"Stayed two nights at this hotel midweek. Rooms were lovely and clean and facilities excellent.
So nice to find such attentive and pleasant staff. I had a few minor issues which were dealt with efficiently and courteously. Great breakfast and evening meal ok, larger selection of main meals would be my only negative for this great stay. Great location for the city, theatres, Titanic museum and the concierge can arrange a pick up to be taken to join the city tour buses. It was so nice being able to get local info from the staff who were local themselves. Would definitely re visit and recommend.",5,2013,10,11
226,"Chic Hotel, but just misses the point","The Fitzwilliam is a modern hotel, beautifully furnished and offering state of the art facilites. The problem comes with the little things that make hotels special. We arrived to find the TV controller didn't work and the staff could not find a nail board for my wifes' broken fingernail. There were tea and coffee making facilities, but no convenient plug for them.. There was only UHT milk and no room in the computerised mini bar to store fresh milk. At breakfast we ordered tea which never arrived and we were offered toast when we had finished eating.
This is a nice city hotel, which could do better. I am sure clients would not notice that they were paying 10% more but would certainly appreciate an increased attention to detail",4,2013,10,10
226,Luxury,"Unfortunately we only stayed for one night as a treat before leaving on an early ferry but, what a treat! Impeccably courteous staff who couldn't do enough to help, beautiful modern d√©cor. A fabulous bed and bathroom. Really couldn't fault anything about the facilities. We treated ourselves to room service as we were going to be up so early the next morning, this was fast, beautifully presented and the food was superb.
If I have any gripe at all it was arriving in the middle of rush hour and really struggling to work out what to do with the car. It turned out that there was valet parking to a secure car park at a charge of ¬£17 for the night, we could have just pulled up outside and let them do the rest. We had booked online in a hurry and were unaware of this so spent nearly half an hour trying to get around to the back of the hotel to find parking. We actually parked in the secure car park by accident as it turned out because the gate was open when it shouldn't have been. A cautionary tale for anyone arriving by car. 
All this was made up for though by the extremely efficient service in the morning.
Not cheap but definitely a luxurious treat.",5,2013,10,07
226,Great Hotel!,"Stayed for 3 nights in Sept and got the best deal from their website.Its a very modern,clean and welcoming hotel classed as 5 star but it is more like a very good 4 star.Staff lovely they couldn't help enough but I did have to request bathrobes for my room at the reception twice and eventually had to phone housekeeping up myself.Other reviews have stated that rooms at the front are noisy and yes I have to agree you can hear the traffic as this is on a main busy road but we still slept great and we are light sleepers so it wasn't a problem,The food was excellent and the bar area is wonderful.There was a problem with my bill at the end of our stay but that was soon sorted out.Its in a great area,in fact location couldn't be better.I wasn't really looking foward to visiting Belfast but it is well worth a visit,fantastic bars,shopping,places of interests and the wonderful northern irish people.Also we went on a bus trip up to The giants causeway etc along the coast route and cant recommend this highly enough because Northern Ireland is beautiful,we will return!",4,2013,10,07
226,Lovely Hotel but a bit overpriced!!,"Stayed here in September for a weekend. Booked online and got a special deal - ¬£200 for 2 nights. Considering the normal price, this was a bargain! The hotel is very centrally located which is excellent for most places in Belfast.
The offer was for a king executive room and I have to say, the room was really nice. Quite spacious, with a good size bathroom, and a comfy bed. 
However, it stated bathrobes are provided for all executive rooms - they aren't. You have to ring guest services and get them sent to your room. Also we were there as a couple, but there were only toiletries left for one person and although we asked for more, they never arrived!
We didn't eat in the hotel as breakfast was another ¬£20 each per day - a bit exorbitant for breakfast!!
Finally, for a (supposedly) 5* hotel, I would expect only the best staff but, I found the front desk staff lacking in every way. They weren't rude but neither were they pleasant - nor did they go out of their way to be helpful. We asked about leaving our luggage on the sunday and were told to 'go over there and someone will sort it' and pointed in the general direction of a desk. Also, we asked for a late check out (as we had a late flight) but were told there would be a charge. However friends of ours who were also staying on the same deal as us, got the late check out for no extra cost - so it obviously depends on who you get.
Overall this is a really nice hotel, but let down by all the things I would think give it the extra star. I wouldn't stay here again because I definitely think there are better hotels in Belfast for less (such as The Merchant)!",4,2013,10,05
226,Magnificent,"Stayed for one night in September. Looking at it from the outside you know you are in for a treat. Upon entering the lobby you are instantly met with a great atmosphere , a roaring fire and a real bright and airy seating area. Reception staff very professional treating guests with the utmost respect with anything being no problem. As my booking was last minute and I checked in really early the staff were really helpful in storing our luggage . Not forgetting the consierges who are really professional, immaculately dressed, willing to do anything they can to make your stay enjoyable whether it be providing information on local attractions, bringing your car or arranging transport. On the day of my arrival we were out all day and when we returned our luggage had been brought to our room. The rooms are immaculate, very spacious, airy and are elegantly decorated and very comfortable. This hotel offers great views over all of Belfast City. Breakfast was piping hot  and cooked as required . Dining room staff very friendly and anxious to know how your stay was going. Dining room really spacious , bright and airy and has really unusual furniture which adds to the atmosphere. Would definitely recommend to friends and have booked to stay again in March. Most definitely the place to stay as very close to city centre and attractions.",5,2013,10,04
226,"Convenient, comfortable and helpful","The hotel is located near the city centre and walking through the city center is very easy (Belfast City Hall is only a few blocks away). Because the hotel is on major roads, the valet parking is a great help (especially since there is virtually no place to park a car even to unload - parking on the sidewalk seems to be allowed for short periods).  The staff is very helpful, especially the   concierge (all of them were wonderful, pleasant and engaging).  Rooms are not large but are very comfortable.  Bathroom is well designed with separate shower and tub.  Breakfast is very nice and the services is quick and efficient.  The bar is fine as well, not too noisy.",5,2013,10,03
226,Cocktail Class,"The ultimate beginning of a fantastic glam night. I went with 13 other girls to enjoy the experience (and it is) of a cocktail class which is taught by Johnny McGuinness (formerly of The Merchant Hotel, Belfast to name but one) - Head of Bar and includes learning to make the perfect tipple like the professionals - all sneaky tips included! A great raconteur, Johnny made the evening one to remember by his skill, knowledge, sense of fun and above all, patience. The setting was beautiful with panoramic views of the city and of course, the cocktails were delicious! Many thanks to Johnny for such a great evening and I'm looking forward to the next one!",5,2013,10,02
226,Cocktail class by Jonathan was amazing,"I attended a cocktail class taken by Jonathan. The class was brilliant. Jonathan was very knowledgable, passionate & professional. I would recommend the class to anyone. Thanks Jonathan for making our night. ",5,2013,10,02
226,Great location but not sure if worth 5 stars,"Rooms dark,couldn't open window in room so slightly stuffy. Lovely bathroom. We had a superior room which was spacious.however the bed was 2 singles pushed together which was not ideal for a 5 star hotel.delicious breakfast cooked to order and attentive staff at breakfast time.some of the extras you would expect in 5 star missing, eg no bath robes,biscuits or water in room.overall a good experience but having stayed in the merchant I found it superior for roughly the same price.",4,2013,09,29
226,Champagne Afternoon tea.,"I purchased this offer through Living Social for champagne afternoon tea for 2. I was very impressed. I had stayed here before so am familiar with decor ambience etc. The afternoon tea was lovely & included just the right amount of sandwiches, pastries and mini desserts. A glass of champagne each added to the experience. Our server a young fair headed fellow was very mannerly & professional. The offer was ¬£20 & apparently the usual price is ¬£40 which I dont think is good value. Prehaps you get more if you pay full price. Overall a very enjoyable experience.  ",4,2013,09,28
226,Champagne afternoon tea,"Went for champagne afternoon tea with family and friends for my 50 th birthday. It was a lovely afternoon, we were in the Restuarant and the food was VERY yummy, plenty of choice even for those who don't do sweet stuff! (I know...mad, ) Champagne flowed, coffee lovely too.
Our waiter,Robin, very helpful and good Craic? 
Thank you Fitzwilliam, 
I hope I'll be back soon!",5,2013,09,28
226,Really lovely hotel,"So impressed with this hotel just wonderful from fantastic comfy beds and pillows tasteful  decor lovely breakfast and a few diff choices esp my fav eggs Benedict which was delicious.
We arrived and my phone was dead the gent checking us in overheard me telling my daughter and he enquired what brand my phone was and was able to get me a charger for the night in a minute ...fantastic I have stayed in many five star hotels across the world and never came across this service and free !!!
Expensive but worth every penny ",5,2013,09,24
226,Amazing experience,"We are just back from a fantastic night in the beautiful Fitzwilliam hotel and were sad to leave it !  My boyfriend surprised me with a night there on Sunday after he proposed to me when he finished the half marathon.  

Katie on reception was so lovely when we told her our news and upgraded us to a corner suite on the 7th floor to congratulate us.

Dinner was absolutely beautiful - the staff were fantastic, particularly Patrick the manager who personally came to our table to pop the bubbly for us.  The chef wrote a lovely congratulations message in chocolate on our dessert plate, and all the wait staff were fantastic.

We went downstairs and bought a drink, and were then sent two glasses of champagne by the staff to celebrate.

We treated ourselves to a beautiful breakfast in bed and were very sad when it came time to check out of Heaven on 7th :-)

Fantastic hotel, fantastic team of staff, am already looking forward to returning on a future anniversary !!",5,2013,09,24
226,Outstanding hotel,"This hotel is fabulous, service is 5 star. The only downside is the cooked breakfast which isn't that great but food in the restaurant is delicious in the evening. I would recommend staying in a suite on the 8th floor the views are fantastic. Walking distance to town centre. We had a great honeymoon here.",5,2013,09,23
226,fab hotel and staff,"To Mr Cian Landers

On the 18th sept at approx  10.35 I arrived at you hotel in a somewhat distressed way when I approached the reception desk how I was so impressed by your staff  Angeline and Caitriona they are just fab.In no time at all they had me sorted with a room and car parking thats when I came upon Philip who is a true gentleman in every sense of the word. I have no doubt whatsoever without these members of staff your hotel would be at a loss.  This is my first time to stay at your hotel and I have to say it is one of the best hotels I have stayed in through out my many trips to many destinations. A big thank you to Angeline, Caitriona and Philip for making stress levels to go from very high to zero. Carmel.",5,2013,09,22
226,Very posh indeed!,"Great location, Great staff, Beautiful facilities, Sound proof rooms but slightly dear. A good place to do the odd splurge. We had our wedding anniversary here but If I were going to Belfast again for any other reason I would probably go for the cheaper option. Good place, you can't go wrong if you can afford the rates.",4,2013,09,22
226,Nice decor,Beautiful decor but not worth the price. The food in the bar was a big let down. Asked for a rare to medium steak but got a well done tasteless steak. Friends had booked this for me as a birthday present as I had always wanted to here. The rooms were beautiful and the beds very comfortable. The bathroom was very spacious. I would not pay the asking price though if the money was out of my pocket! Not worth it. The mirrors in the corridors are a nice touch!,4,2013,09,22
226,Beautiful,"Hotel was modern, stylish and a great location in the city. Stayed two nights, first night had breakfast in our room, eggs benedict was amazing. Cocktails in the bar was delicious, rooms were spacious and clean, the bed was huge. Totally recommend this hotel, would stay again. ",5,2013,09,17
226,Great hotel in a great location!,"This hotel was great! We stayed for one night to celebrate our 1st wedding anniversary and we were not disappointed! The hotel was clean and modern, the staff were very helpful and polite. We went for the fully flexible bed and breakfast rate.  The room was spacious, with modern decor and great views from the floor to ceiling windows.  There was plenty of choice for breakfast from cereal and fruit to pastries and a good cooked selection.  We would definitely stay again and recommend this hotel to others!",4,2013,09,16
226,lovely modern hotel in Belfast,"My husband and I recently stayed in the Fitzwilliam hotel in Belfast. When we arrived we were greeted by staff and everyone was very welcoming and helpful. I have stayed in quite a few lovely hotels and I thought this hotel was just fabulous. The rooms were big, bright and funky. The bar was great the 2 female waitresses were lovely always smiling and attentive to all the customers. We had a lovely meal, the cocktails were amazing and the atmosphere was so relaxed and I really enjoyed it. The hotel manager ""Kevin"" was very nice also enquiring if we were enjoying ourselves and also upon checkout asking how we found our stay. I think it's the personal touches that count and happy friendly staff go a long way in my book. Such a lovely hotel and will definitely be back.",5,2013,09,15
226,Among the Best!!,"What a wonderful hotel, and most accommodating, friendly, helpful and service-oriented staff!!

Excellent location, walking to the nearby downtown and restaurants.  Excellent breakfast buffet, and hot breakfast to order.

Concierge services are very attuned to your interests.
Rooms are very well appointed.  Excellent servicing.
Valet parking is only a couple of ‚Ç¨ more than the self-park across the street.",5,2013,09,15
226,Great modern hotel in Belfast,"I was very pleased with our stay in the Fitzwilliam Hotel. The surroundings and the rooms were lush. My husband and I like to stay in nice hotels when we go away as it is our treat to ourselves and we were not disappointed. The rooms are well equipped, clean and spacious. Adequate for the money we paid. The hotel is perfectly located with the town center and pubs/ bars within a walking distance. 
The hotel bar is quite expensive (as in any hotel) but the quality of the drinks is brilliant. Cocktails are amazing and you even get a freshly prepared lemonade if you order alcohol with lemonade (I urge anyone to try it)...
The only slight negative was the breakfast. My husband is gluten intolerant and there was no gluten free option. It would not be a problem as he wanted to build his own breakfast with options he could have and ordered 2x eggs, bacon etc. When his breakfast turned up it had 1x egg, 2x rushers of bacon and 1x mushroom. Not a lot to be fair. We explained the situation to the waitress the next morning and asked for a bit more food. However, the same breakfast had turned up! My eggs benedicts was equally as pathetic. It was very tasty but only got one poached egg with some ham on a whole English muffin. The continental breakfast assortment was not great either. Only 2 different types of cold meats, some bread, slices of one type of cheese, butter, but no cream/ soft cheese and not a lot else. Granted there was a good selection of cereals and fresh fruit. I am not sure why the hotel would be stingy on breakfast when they excel at the rest of the stuff. 
Overall I would recommend the hotel as all the staff were excellent, friendly and could not help you enough and it was up to a very good standard.",4,2013,09,12
226,Quality hotel in Belfast,"I recently stayed at the Fitzwilliam Hotel for 4 nights.  It is a good quality hotel, good sized rooms with free wi-fi, and quiet despite the location.  The bar was well managed with polite and friendly staff, as was the restaurant although I only took breakfast in the hotel.
The location is good, with some really good restaurants and bars nearby, but with the hustle and bustle of the city center a few minutes walk away!
All that was missing was a gym, which are generally in short supply in any city center hotel.",4,2013,09,11
226,"Lovely Hotel, Brilliant Staff, Rubbish food","Had my first experience of The Fitzwilliam Hotel last night and won't be in a hurry to repeat it.
A group of us had booked a pre- theatre meal. Upon reaching the restaurant the staff very promptly showed us to our table with very friendly welcoming smiles and chat, seated us very quickly and promptly took our drinks order - no complaints about this part of the evening. Can't even complain about the service of the food  - it all happened very smoothly - however I can complain about the quality and quantity of the food - its a set menu for pre - theatre and whilst I cannot claim to have any professional cooking skills (I am just an interested home cook) I could have cooked better meals - I ordered salted chilli chicken  with ginger and coleslaw for starters - what turned up was an insult - three small frozen chicken (want to call them goujons but can't as they were tiny) nuggets on a spoonful of dry coleslaw (couldn't find the ginger) with a drizzle of common supermarket sweet chilli sauce. For mains I ordered chicken on a bed of champ with bacon, wilted spinach and a cream sauce. The portion size was miniscule - I am not a massive eater but even I found this portion size to be inadequate - it might have just about filled my 5 yr old grandson. It was cooked well enough, but nothing about it that left me longing for more.
The hotel experience was fine - the food would put me of returning again.",3,2013,09,11
226,Central location - fantastic staff,"Had a fantastic one night stay in this hotel.   Really central which is perfect for any tours etc you would want to do.  
From first contact with check-in staff everything was just fabulous.  Decided to eat in hotel restaurant as we were tired and what a good decision this was.    The special was ¬£55 for 3 courses, a bottle of wine and tea or coffee for two which was really first class.    Food was excellent, steak was cooked to perfection and Sean was a very friendly and helpful waiter.   
After dinner we headed down to the bar and Jonathan was on hand to really ensure we enjoyed our drinks - what a friendly and helpful guy.  He took time out to sit and chat to us which we really appreciated and it all added to our visit.    Would definitely stay here again and if in Belfast for an evening would eat in the hotel restaurant as the food was so good.",5,2013,09,10
226,Georgeous Place,"Have just returned from three nights at this hotel where my Canadian family accompanied me. It was our first time in Ireland and we simply couldn't have picked a better place to stay. Friendly staff, excellent rooms, great food and service and all at what was a very reasonable rate. The local is simply splendid for getting about and is a short stride from the bus terminus.",4,2013,09,09
226,great staff in fitzwilliam,"Really excellent hotel, very friendly staff who go extra mile.
Excellent location to see Belfast.
Sean in restaurant and Jonathan the cocktail star in the bar are super, reception staff make you feel really welcome.
Jonathon's Lady Nuna cocktail is great
Highly recommend hotel!",5,2013,09,08
226,Fantastic staff and lovely room!,"Staff was very helpful, above and beyond! Room gorgeous and breakfast top notch! Loved the vibe here and highly recommend. Location terrific for the city. Highly recommend the driver they chose for our city tour",5,2013,09,08
226,Classiest hotel in Belfast,"I stay here several times a year, never a disappointment.  Lovely d√©cor, tasteful design rooms, very trendy foyer and bar.  Dinner here WILL delight you and breakfast will have something for everyone, I recommend the smoked salmon egg's benedict.",5,2013,09,08
226,"A great hotel, excellent staff","Stayed here for one night as a treat for myself and best friend. The room was lovely, spotless and well appointed. The bathroom was luxurious. The location is bang on city centre. The staff are excellent not only did I get a little welcome card for my birthday but everyone we met was friendly and helpful especially Philip on reception, can't wait to stay again ",5,2013,09,06
226,Dissapointed,"Stayed here on 3rd Sept.I have to agree with Mojitolovers.Certainly not a 5 star or anyway near it.Booked because it was my partners birthday,but sorry I did.Promised an upgrade when I booked but none available when we booked in or so we were told.We were told that we were getting an executive room but this is their standard room.It was very small.Dust in the bathroom.no shelf.had to leave our toilet bags on the floor.Breakfast was average,My partner had scrambled eggs but could nt touch them.We didn't risk having dinner when we saw the room.Probably a 3 star hotel but that's about it.Wouldnt recommend it.Going back to Europa,",2,2013,09,05
226,Grahame & Cathy August 2013,"Nicely appointed room, albeit a little small but to be expected of a city hotel.
Service and food and drinks all very good indeed.
I would have given the overall rating as 'excellent' except for the toilet seat in our room.
A modern bathroom, done out in black, white, glass and chrome but with a square seat that cut into my bottom and was not very comfortable at all.
My wife did not complain but that's probably because she has a slightly smaller bottom than me.",4,2013,09,04
226,wonderfully located hotel,"The highlight of my visit were the staff who were friendly and helpful from the front desk to the concierge to the wait staff.  The room is nice, if a little small.  Lights are a little tricky to operate and we did have an issue with our wake-up call but once alerted the staff made sure the concierge came and knocked on the door for us. Breakfast was wonderful, although the coffee is not good, but I never got a good cup of coffee in Ireland. Had to request extra towels even though they knew it was two women in the room.  The hotel is centrally located so nothing is very far but taxis adn banks are easy to get.",4,2013,09,03
226,Very Nice!,"I stayed at the Fitzwilliam for one night whilst visiting the province last weekend.
The staff were very helpful and offered the traditional Ulster welcome. The room was appointed and it was very enjoyable. Staff went to special lengths to obtain my choice of newspaper. Breakfast the following morning was good too.
The hotel is well located in the heart of the city centre and I am already looking for a reason to return!",5,2013,09,03
226,Hen night,"Organised a hen party in Belfast and stayed here for one night. Staff were helpful although they gave away the larger room to somebody else by accident, no rooms left so compensated by giving us two glasses of wine. The hotel is convenient to bars, restaurants and shopping. Rooms were modern and clean.
Corridors are a bit too dark for my taste. Breakfast was delicious. Overall it was a very good experience.",5,2013,09,02
226,Excellent hotel and location!,"My boyfriend and I stayed in the Fitzwilliam in July for a couple of nights break for my birthday. From the moment we arrived to the moment we left we had a completely hassle free time.

The decor of the hotel is very modern and makes for a very relaxing stay. The bedroom had a HUGE and really comfortable bed. Room seemed to be very clean and there was no noise heard during the night. 

The hotel is very centrally located and is about a minutes walk from the main bus station in Belfast.

Would definitely recommend this hotel to anyone who is going to Belfast for business or a short break!",5,2013,09,02
226,Good business hotel,"I stayed here for 5 nights on a business trip.  It is centrally located, and has many bars and restaurants within walking distance.  The lobby is inviting.  I found the bar to be a bit dark in the evening and had to use my phone to read the bar menu.  Nice selection of food and drink at the bar for fare later in the evening.  My room came with breakfast.  The selection of rolls, ham, cheese, fruit, croissants, cereals, etc., was perfect.  I did not try the hot breakfast.  Concierge was great, helping us to find a taxi that took American Express, or one that didn't require chip and pin.  Loved my room, it was nice and quiet. Free internet was very good.  Plenty of plugs in the room to charge my phone, run my computer, etc.  I didn't have a car on this trip, but the parking was pretty expensive.  I would definitely stay here again, if given the opportunity.  I wouldn't say this is a 5 Star, but the location was excellent and the staff friendly.",5,2013,08,31
226,Great service,"The staff at this hotel went out of their way to ensure you had a great stay.  The restaurant was well appointed and staff attentive, the concierge ready to assist and reception staff helpful. The rooms were comfortable and decor interesting. Overall, great stay",5,2013,08,28
226,Great quality and service,"My wife and I stayed for a weekend in August 2013. I was very impressed with the hotel, service was great from the people on reception through to the waiters at breakfast. The hotel is modern, it still feels new with everything in good condition. I asked for a quiet room and was given this with one at the end of the corridor. Rooms were large, excellent size double bed and the bathroom had a large, powerful, walk in shower as well as a bath, all very clean. Lovely breakfast on both days, the hot food is cooked to order and we enjoyed the eggs benedict, salmon benedict and the full Irish.
The hotel is in a good central location, it is close to the Crown pub which is a must visit when in Belfast. We arrived at 10am knowing our room wouldn't be ready but left our luggage and the room was ready as promised at 2pm.
I've seen other reviewers complain about the price, personally I'm happy to pay a bit more for quality and feel that is what I got at the Fitzwilliam, if you want cheap and cheerful go to a Premier Inn or similar. I felt this hotel was worth the money and happily recommend it.",5,2013,08,27
226,A bit of a let down!,"I stayed here with my boyfriend as a treat and had booked the dinner bed and breakfast package. Firstly the positives... The door staff,bar staff, concierge and reception staff were friendly, helpful and couldn't do enough and. Most pleasant start to our stay but after that Im afraid it went downhill!

The room itself is lovely but a terrible view of the nearby car park and the curtain was coming off its railing making it look very untidy, the bed was two singles pushed together which for a supposed 5 star really isn't good. The bathroom is lovely, clean and modern but there were so many touches that were missing that you expect in a 5 star... No cotton wool for make up removal, no hair conditioner, no q tips, none of the extras you expect! Yes maybe pernickety but IT IS purporting to be 5 star!!!! Now dinner (and yes I should have complained at the time but I didn't want to spoil my time by having to complain!!) it was obvious that because we were on a deal it was sub standard... A plum tomato tart which didn't use plum tomatoes??? The tart itself was barely cooked and as a result soggy and barely edible. My partners chicken was hardly a portion and the dessert tasted like it may have seen better (fresher) days... Yes they were busy but that is no excuse and just because Im on a limited menu doesn't mean I don't deserve a good standard of food!!!!! To top it all no one asked if we wanted a drink before we ordered and I had to literally grab a waiter to ask for the wine list!!!! Im afraid breakfast the next morning wasn't much better, yes I ordered room service and its always more limited than when you go to the restaurant but at ¬£7 tray charge you expect it to be at least warm!!!!!!

Im afraid that I won't be returning and was very disappointed... Too many corners being cut and certainly not a 5 star!!!!",2,2013,08,27
226,Excellent location & Service,"Stayed over a long weekend in August, service was fanatatsic and staff were always on hand.
Breakfast was excellent, plenty of choice and very attentive staff.
Rooms were large and spacious, cleaned daily and toiletries replaced.
The TV was hit and miss- dreadful signal, but the HiFi System was a good find with tea/coffee, mini bar and ironing board all came in useful too!",5,2013,08,27
226,afternoon tea with my daughter,"Was invited for afternoon tea to this lovely hotel in the centre of Belfast near also to train and bus station. Lovely surprise from my daughter. We were greeted by a lovely friendly waiter who looked after us for the afternoon. The food was lovey  sandwiches, home made scones with jam. cakes and pastry and great coffee, best of all was the Champagne to wash it all down... the hotel was very clean and modern furniture in the lobby.  Very pleasant way to spend a friday afternoon. would love to stay over sometime for a weekend would be lovely.",4,2013,08,26
226,Very Good 4 Star,"Spent two nights here and am writing this in the bar having had a very good Club Sandwich and a couple of Guinness's for lunch before my flight back to England.
The hotel has a great location and the staff are extremely efficient and polite.
The rooms are modern and comfortable with a very good bathroom. Fittings are of high quality and the beds are super comfy with pillows which are exactly right for me (firm). Wifi is free and fast which is real plus!
The bar, in the evenings buzzes and drinks are reasonably priced.
Negatives are few but the TV channels are limited and on the two nights we were there, the reception on the TV was dreadful. It's not a major draw-back but nevertheless irritating.
My wife has stayed in several of the Belfast hotels as she visits every month and she prefers this place to most of the others. I can see why.
",4,2013,08,26
226,Terrific all around,"The location, value and quality of this hotel far exceeded my expectations.  I felt like I could have stayed happily in the room for weeks.  The bed was extremely comfortable; on the first night I laid down for a ""quick rest"" and slept straight through until morning.  The rest of the furniture (sofa, desk chair) were also terrific.  The decor was muted and peaceful, the staff highly professional, and the bar makes a mean Manhattan.",5,2013,08,26
226,Dark but fabulous,"Stayed here the weekend of the 16th of August, in room 510. The room was beautiful and well provisioned with an extremely comfortable bed and a huge sofa. The decor was lovely but the fixtures were a bit bashed and scuffed, the edges of the bed, the desk, and the skirting were quite roughed up. The bathroom is huge and gorgeous, but the bath is an actual nightmare to get out of! 

The staff were very helpful, and any minor issues we had were resolved immediately. Definitely a quality hotel and I can't wait to stay again!",5,2013,08,25
226,Great location,"Great welcome from the girl at reception who was very friendly and helpful. The room was spotless and trendy, loved the modern bathroom and especially the little touch of a candle by the bath. Everything we needed was provided in the room and the hotel was in a great location, right in the city centre. Free wi-fi in the room was a huge bonus too",5,2013,08,24
226,"God hotel, well located and enjoyed our stay very much","This hotel will be difficult to find fault with. It's 'Irish"" 5 star but really its a great 4 star. We were looked after well from first arrival through to checkout. 
We took advantage of the 2 night midweek deal incl breakfast and 1 dinner. 
The set menu had a really good selection of quality food well presented and served with a smile. Katherine was our waitress for the evening meal, and she is a true asset to the hotel. The small issue we had was very quickly sorted out without any problem or fuss
Rooms were a lot more spacious and cleaner than the Hilton in Belfast. It's within easy walking distance of anything you would want to do or see. Can't see any reason to not enjoy your stay here. ",4,2013,08,22
226,Quality Feel at every Turn,"Good location about 10 minute walk from main shopping centres and close to the bus terminal were the airport bus goes to (we flew into Belfast and got the airport bus as only took 30 minutes and good value as well), very close to theatres as well.

We had an executive room, well worth it, hotel is not cheap but does offer value for money, sleep quality excellent, room was as clean tidy as you would expect at the price, bathrooms are really good.

We used the bar area which had a good feel to it, fairly trendy, lively but not so you couldn't hear yourself speak, bar is a must at night. We did use the restaurant which was top notch for dinner and breakfast and we found the staff to be helpful, happy and keen to please so this is one of the best places I have stayed in.",5,2013,08,21
226,Perfect weekend break,"Stayed for one night at this hotel.  Young and trendy, the staff were very friendly and helpful.  The rooms didn't have much of a view, but the room was spotless with all the expected facilities.  The bar is very popular for pre-theatre drinks and there was a lovely, lively atmosphere.  Breakfast in the morning was really delicious.  Only thing they didn't have was skimmed milk, which is a real bug bear of mine!  Still, it was a hotel I would certainly use again and the location is very central.",4,2013,08,19
226,Brilliant Hotel,"Stayed here on Wednesday 14th August, Arrived at this beautiful hotel and was greeted by the receptionst who was very pleasant and very helpful!

Rooms had everything you needed, very spacious, clean and very comfortable bed!!

Location of the hotel is right in the city centre, 2 mins from bus/train station and 5 mins walking distance to the centre of town!

Will definately be back here again :)!!",5,2013,08,19
226,"Lovely hotel, great location.  Some members of staff have it bang on, others.........haven't.","The hotel is comfortable and functional.  We upgraded our booking having stayed in their standard room last time, but I failed to see the difference in all honesty. Missing hairdryers, and other standard fixtures of hotel rooms.  That said, it is clean and functional and has an amazing bath to relax in.
The staff seem to be a mixed bag of wanting to help and knowing the hotel trade inside out to, quite frankly, earning a buck.  Some were lovely ad very helpful and were brilliant at attention to detail (like my birthday surprise in the restaurant), others weren't so helpful.  Some couldn't even find manners in fact.  
A shame, but when I book quality I expect it!",4,2013,08,18
226,Wow factor!!!!,"I loved this hotel, the concierge greeted us and took our car (beware ¬£17 to park car overnight) receptionist was friendly also and gave us a great farewell. This hotel is in a great location beside the train station. This hotel is amazing, so funky and very modern. Our room was on the fifth floor and it was amazing, loved the decor , clean and so comfortable. I will definitely book this hotel again, everyone should experience it.",5,2013,08,18
226,Amazing!,"Just returned from a 2 night stay with my boyfriend in the Fitzwilliam and I just wish we could stay longer! It totally exceeded our expectations. The staff are exceptional especially Declan from concierge...he was so helpful and informative about the local area and events..he went above and beyond to make our stay an enjoyable one..I hope the management will pass on our thanks to him he is an absolute credit to the hotel! 
The rooms are so plush and very well designed...the bed was the most comfortable bed I've ever slept in and the rainforest shower was to die for...the CD player with the mp3 port on it is a nice touch, although we didn't have a cable to connect our iPhone to it, we asked Marius from housekeeping if the hotel had a spare and he organized someone from concierge to drop one up to the room within minutes!
On the first day we had the per-theatre menu in the bar with a few cocktails..we both had the steak..it was fab..The mojitos are made to perfection too!! The waitress (blonde haired girl in her 20s) was very bright and bubbly I'm just sorry I didn't manage to get her name to thank her for helping me choose a cocktail and advising us on the local pubs and clubs!
The breakfast is delicious also, plenty of choice and very fresh..again the manager (robin I think his name was!) was so pleasant and attentive to everyone even though it was busy..

Overall I think this hotel is amazing for a city break and so luxurious in comparison to others. 
The staff are second to none and I hope the management are aware of the great job they are doing. 
We don't often get the opportunity to stay somewhere as exclusive as the Fitzwilliam but I think we will try our best to return in the near future! 
 ",5,2013,08,18
226,Will not be returning,"Nice place, nice location but the service ruined the experience. The staff, all except the wonderful concierge phillip, made us work hard from stocking our mini bar to cleaning our room and to top it all off charging exorbitant fees for laundry. It seems to be good intentions but lack of training.",2,2013,08,17
226,Didn't meet our expectations,"After seeing the positive reviews and rating here in tripadvisor, we decided to stay at the fitzwilliam with confidence; little did we know what was coming out way: restaurant closed for a (noisy) private function, very limited room service menu, from which only 30% of the offered dishes were available. Dirty carpet floor. Not replenished mini bar, which also had beers that the previous guest had brought and left there. Toilet garbage bin had rubbish from previous guest. Going on: front desk personnel couldn't make their mind on rates and fees for our bill, and the laundry service arrived way too late and was outrageously expensive (as was the hotel considering what you get for your money). On the plus side, location is really good, (Irish) breakfast was good as well, and Phillip the concierge was an excellent host. 
Sadly, not staying there ever again.",3,2013,08,17
226,Perfect location,"Perfect location , on the edge of the city makes this a good hotel from which to visit the many bars and restaurants , close to many of the main shopping areas and city attractions .

Great people and places to visit .
See review on city sightseeing .",5,2013,08,12
226,Excellent Hotel,"Excellent Hotel - the staff are excellent they do everything they can to ensure you enjoy your stay.
The bedrooms are not really 5 star although they are very comfortable. There is poor TV reception and very limited channels also the TV are flat screen but are small and need up dating. The breakfast was very good with excellent service the only criticism I could make is that the toaster needs updating and the fresh fruit could be better, having said that it was good value for the money.
I would stay there again asit was in an excellent location and the staff were great even though it was not quite 5 star but very close.",5,2013,08,12
226,Best Egg Benedict,"You couldn't get a more central hotel n Belfast. It's lobby is open and fresh. The corridors upstairs have a hard seductive feel to them. Standard rooms are comfortable enough. Spacious enough for a couple or business man. Quality of the decor and bathroom is excellent, walk in showers. My biggest gripe would be the noise. Even the higher rooms still have noise from the traffic bellow.  Difficult to get a good nights sleep if you enough the freshness of an open window. 

The breakfast in the Fitz is excellent. Even if your staying somewhere else the breakfast is worth every penny. I've yet to find a hotel that can beat the Fitzwilliam's Eggs Benedict, even the sister hotel in Dublin runs a second close. Parking in the near by multi storey if fine or the hotel charge for their own on site parking.",4,2013,08,11
226,Less than expected,"Good hotel but definitely not a five star hotel.  Has a very trendy look and feel.  Rooms are vey dark and not really that clean.  On a positive note Service at front desk is really good.  The bar is average.  Its quiet almost all the time- and does not feel very welcoming - chairs and space are cool and not comfortable.   When talking to locals this hotel has quite a reputation for being the best.  Having nothing to compare it with in Belfast I cannot say but trust the locals that it is one of nicest downtown.  Big plus is the convenience to everything - you are in a perfect location.  The famous 'crown bar"" is across the street and should not be missed....I might try the Merchant hotel or the Europa on next visit.",4,2013,08,08
226,Perfect location...central,"Smiley and helpful staff on arrival, they could not do more to ensure that our stay would be a good one. Rooms are well appointed and have the usual amenities. The only issue encountered in the bathroom was that the shower recess floor was very slippery when wet, which could be dangerous for elderly people. The variety of food for breakfast was disappointing where the was not much to choose from for the hot meals and when they arrived, it lacked in quality and quantity and this goes the same with the Bar food for dinner. Overall a good hotel, but the meals could be better.",3,2013,08,08
226,Excellent Hotel,"I spent the last four days with my family at The Fitzwilliam Hotel & to sum up our stay......WOW!!!!

To allocate five stars to this hotel just isn't enough.

The hotel is in an excellent location in Belfast. It's a modern hotel. There is only valet parking as the hotel car park is behind the hotel. 

The staff were brilliant. I have four young children and from the minute we walked inside the door of the hotel the staff were so friendly, helpful & totally understanding of childrens' excitable behaviour.  The conceirge were great with the kids, always engaging them in conversation when we were in the foyer. They asked the kids about their day, where they had been to that day etc. They had little jokes for them. My kids coloured pictures for them before we left, that's how friendly these guys made my kids feel! 

The breakfast was lovely, a good selection of fresh fruit, cereal, meats, pastries etc.

We had dinner in the hotel twice.  Both evenings the meals were delicious, special mention the langoustine risotto, delicious. There was a kids menu with healthly options. When we needed to make changes to the set menu for the kids it wasn't a problem at all. The restaurant staff suggested alternatives for the kids which was great, one less thing for me to think about. We got back to the hotel later than expected one evening, 8pm, and requested a table away from the main busy restaurant area as the kids were tired from our day out. Again this was not a problem for the restaurant staff. They re-set a table for us to the side of restaurant that had been set up for breakfast the next day. This was great as we could all enjoy our meal without being worried about disturbing the other guests.

The bar looked lovely but I can't comment on the drinks/cocktails this time round, maybe I'll get to check it out without the kids someday. 

I'm looking forward to returning the Fitzwilliam Hotel soon.",5,2013,08,07
226,Great location. Nice service,"Arrived very early ie 9am.  Checked in and took my case.  When I got back at ten o clock pm. My case was in room.  Reception staff lovely and helpful.   When got to bedroom it's a nice room very modern.   One of the better hotels in Belfast. I didn't eat or drink so can't comment. However the bar was busy. And a great buzz when walked in

Would stay again and location was good",4,2013,08,06
226,Fantastic!,I stayed here with my boyfriend for 2 nights. I really couldn't fault the hotel at all. The room was so beautiful and modern. The food was amazing. We had a lovely night in the hotel bar just sipping on cocktails. I'd only traveled to Belfast for a wedding but would love to go back now just to stay here again.,5,2013,08,05
226,Lovely stay in a very modern hotel.,"Stayed 2 nights in the Fitzwilliam, and had a very pleasant, relaxed stay. 

We arrived quite early, around 10:30am and our rooms were ready, which was a great surprise. Very easy check in, and helpful staff to explain the local area, things to do etc. A great concierge desk who will arrange you trips around Belfast and outside the city such as to the Giant's Causeway. 

The hotel is designed to a very high level, the modern interior and design is a great feature and give the hotel a 'wow' factor.  The rooms vary in sizes, as the 2 rooms we had were of a similar set up and same price, but one was probably half the size of the bigger one. 

The bed was very comfortable, the shower was excellent, loved the huge size of the bathroom, a bath and shower to chose from. My only criticism of the hotel, is that my room was extremely stuffy and hot, and the air conditioning was very hard to work. So left the window open for my whole stay. 

Location is very good. Only a 10 minute walk to the city centre and the all shops, also where you can pick up the sight seeing tours etc. 

Overall a good stay, and would definitely stay again if I returned to Belfast.",4,2013,08,05
226,40th wedding anniversary stay,We decided to stay in a hotel and have a celebratory meal.From the moment we entered the Fitzwilliam we were treated to a great stay.The staff were most attentive and nothing was too much trouble for them. We enjoyed our short stay so much that they deserve this review.The continental breakfast was fabulous.We have dined there before and will again - no doubt .,5,2013,08,04
226,The best in Belfast,"There is nothing to criticise about this hotel. It's opulent, luscious and gorgeous, the rooms are simply fantastic. I like to stay in the King Executive corner rooms with good views of the beautiful Belfast City, however was upgraded on my last visit to the Penthouse, I just can't stop talking about it!

Imagine an opulent London Mayfair flat with two double ensuite bathrooms lounge and dining area, kitchen for the butler, now travel to floor 8 of the Fitzwilliam and you will discover all this behind door 800, I was simply blown away with the beauty of the room, the views are outstanding!!

Maybe out of most people's price range at ¬£1500 a night and certainly mine but this hotel has everything! The only hotel to stay in whilst visiting Belfast",5,2013,08,02
226,Awesome!,"This hotel is really cool! The rooms are very modern, and we loved the d√©cor. The location is excellent, right in the heart of the city. Service is excellent; we particularly want to compliment James, the duty manager, who is extremely friendly and patiently answered all our questions when we pestered him :)

The only real complain I have is that parking is not free. Parking at the hotel costs ¬£17/night, which is incredibly steep. We parked on the street. Meters are free until 9:30AM, and there's plenty of street parking around. It's just a bit annoying that you have to wake up early to feed the meter. Note that you can only feed it starting at 9:30 exactly, no earlier.

Note: I'm not at liberty to go into specifics, but the cast of a certain well-known TV show stays here when they film in Northern Ireland. So we had the pleasure of meeting some celebrities in the lobby, which was a nice added bonus. And, if I'm being completely honest, this was our favorite TV show, so meeting the cast kind of made our trip :-)",5,2013,08,01
226,Great Staff!,"Myself and my partner stayed at the Fitzwilliam 2 weeks ago and we were delighted with the service we received.  From check in to departure all the staff were friendly and courteous.  The bedroom was clean and bed very comfortable, loved the full length mirrors.  The bar was nice to have a few cocktails before heading out, but the only criticism I would have is the slow inexperienced bar staff.  Breakfast was first class.  Would definitely recommend this hotel however the rates could come down a bit.",5,2013,07,31
226,Modern & Chic,"The Fitzwilliam is very nice!! Rooms are excellent and service is great, the breakfast was our favourite!! As a vegetarian I had the potato bread (which was the best i've ever had) and the vegetarian sausage (unlike any other) Location is wonderful as it's walking distance to so many things, very central.",5,2013,07,31
226,Good 4 star,Spent 3 nights here with family.  Staff were very pleasant and helpful.  Rooms were ok but certainly not 5 star.  No bathrobes and only one pillow per person.  The sound proofing in the rooms was largely Ineffective.   We could hear the people in the next door room talking and their music woke us at 1.30am.     Food was good - there was plenty of choice  at breakfast and my son enjoyed the full Irish.  Would I stay here again?  As I'm a light sleeper probably not!,4,2013,07,30
226,A must vist,Just returned from a 3 night stay here.Reception staff were very nice on arrival.When we returned later bags had been taken to our room.Discovered air con wasnt working.Concierge Declan brought a fan to the room for us.Next morning we were told that air con couldnt be fixed until Monday and were immediately offered an alternative room.The room was lovely .Very clean.Bed massive.Bathroom also large and spotless.Staff couldnt be faulted and i will be returning for another stay in the future,5,2013,07,29
226,Disappointing!! Poor housekeeping & Argumentative Staff!!,"My wife and I visited The Fitzwilliam this month for a 2 night stay, 1. To celebrate my 40th birthday, and also visit family in Northern Ireland as I live in Scotland. 
I read quite a few reviews on the hotel and from these I decided to book, location is fantastic right in the centre and close to everywhere, no on site parking but you can park your car between 6:00pm & 8:00am on street free between these times next to Jury's hotel,across the road. 

From the outside and lobby this is a very modern hotel and looks the part, thou corridors to rooms have very dark lighting and if you look closely poorly cleaned, dust and dirt where even the cleaners can't see or can't be bothered. 
The room that was allocated to us wasn't what I would expect from a 5* hotel, bathroom sink was severely cracked, overall cleanliness of the room was poor, white stains on the bed throw( and I don't care to imagine what that was) and to top it off the aircon did not work! 
I reported the aircon problem to the front desk on going out of the hotel and on our return it still wasn't working, so called front desk again to be told that the air con in the room had been reset and to wait 15 mins. This time passed and was no better, so I called again and had a return call from the concierge who argued with me on the effect running of the air con, more than shocked on his attitude!!!
We where eventually moved to another room that was slightly bigger, but same poor level of house keeping, and stains on bed throw again. 

Nice hotel to look at and walk through, but when you look a litter closer The Fitzwilliam falls well below the standards of a 5* hotel on housekeeping/ and more importantly how their staff treat paying customers!",3,2013,07,28
226,First Class,"Spent one night here on business. My room was really nicely designed with a superbly comfy bed. ( I stayed in a king exec ), The bathroom is actually quite stunning with great white company products and a separate walk in shower etc. Everything felt and looked very plush and cool. The staff that I encountered were first class and really helpful which sometimes isnt the norm in boutique hotels. The hotel location is also ideal as its 1mins from the M1 and then you are walking distance to all the restaurants etc. ( tip - check out Mourne Seafood - it is first class )

Just as an FYI - the hotel dont have a car park as such but the concierge will valet park your car for ¬£17. TBH thats not bad considering its a city centre hotel and a multi-storey even local to the hotel would be about the same overnight. 

I will definitely be back.",5,2013,07,27
226,Excellent hotel,"Really lovely staff who were very helpful, this hotel is ideally located and very close to ads and restaurants. The hotel bar does great cocktails too.
It's very stylish and I wouldn't hesitate in booking to stay here again ",5,2013,07,27
226,A four day Belfast City Break,"Being a return guest, I would not hesitate to recommend this hotel to family and friends. Situated within a few meters from the Grand Opera House, Europa Hotel and bus station, this hotel is a few minutes walk to all the usual attractions one would want to visit. Staff and service can not be faulted and the food whether in the bar or restaurant was superb. I received a free upgrade to a King Deluxe room on check-in (302) and can honestly say one of the nicest rooms I have stayed in (the bathroom being the size of the average European hotel room) and floor to ceiling windows on two sides of the bedroom. I will stay here again on my next visit to Belfast.",5,2013,07,25
226,Stylish hotel in the perfect location,A well designed stylish hotel in the centre of Belfast. Rooms are the best I have seen in a while. Staff are friendly and valet parking is very helpful. Definitely returning here on my next trip to Belfast,5,2013,07,24
226,First class in every respect.,Checked in early evening and from the excellent and friendly front desk staff to the room it was a fantastic stay although far too short.... We stay in room #606 and was absolutely perfect.....be hard pressed to remember a finer hotel.,5,2013,07,24
226,Warm welcome awaits you !,"Superb location in the city centre with lots of shops, traditional pubs, restaurants and sights in walking distance. This is a super hotel with warm welcoming reception staff. The rooms and decor throughout are excellent. My room was great with a super bathroom. The breakfast was excellent and I would recommend this hotel for a business trip or family weekend trip to this great city.",5,2013,07,23
226,Excellent hotel,"I stayed in the Fitzwilliam, Belfast for one night.  I booked a twin room for myself and a friend as we were going to Belfast for a relaxing shopping trip.  I booked a dinner package using the hotel's website.
We weren't disappointed!  On arrival our car was parked for us as valet parking was provided (at an extra cost).  Our room was lovely-decorated well, clean and modern.  We were impressed with the bathroom-good quality toiletries and full length mirrors! 
We ate in the hotel's restaurant and the food was delicious.  Service was also of a high standard.  The next morning we had breakfast-plenty of choices and very tasty too!
After checking out, our car was parked at the front door for us.  A very enjoyable stay and would definitely recommend this hotel.  We will be back for our next shopping trip!",5,2013,07,22
226,Fantastic hotel,"Just back from a stay in the fitzwilliam , by far best hotel I've stayed in .the staff are extremely attentive and look after their customers so well.Food in the restaurant is very tasty and served beautifully .Cocktails are super. The service at breakfast is fantastic .Had a fantastic stay in your hotel and can't wait to return .The hotel is run so well and I congratulate the management team for running such a super hotel .",5,2013,07,21
226,"Great hotel, very stylish","Stayed here one night in the middle if July. We really enjoyed our stay here for the one night. The rooms were very clean, well kept and in great condition. We had had drinks and nibbles in the bar with great service, quality and price! Breakfast in the morning was excellent, so much to choose from! The only issue was that the air con did not properly, and being as got as it was in July we were very hot in the room, considering there was no window to open, slept well consideribg though. We mentioned this issue to the reception in the morning and told they had an issue with the air con throughout the hotel due to a fire alarm later that day, was no real problem, fully enjoyed the stay considering!! Would go back in a heart beat!!",5,2013,07,19
226,Did not fail to impress!,"We got there really early hoping to place the bags in a side room until check in but lo and behold our room was ready at 10:30am - excellent! Rooms are amazing, very very clean and decorated fantastic! Bathrooms are huge, large walk in shower and a separate bath on other side. Did not dine in the hotel so could not rate the food, however the concierge did advise us of good places to dine in Belfast which was a welcome change to simply promoting hotels own restaurant for the sake of it. And can I say the recommendation from him did not fail either. Cocktails in the bar were fantastic also. ",5,2013,07,19
226,"Cool hotel, expensive car park","The hotel has a great, modern interiour design! The bath room was gorgeous! Breakfast also. Staff also. Recommendable! Not so good: we had to pay 17¬£ per day to park our car. And the car was covered by dove excrements as we picked it up after 2 days.",5,2013,07,19
226,"Excellent location, service could be better","Hotel is well located very close to the train station and the city centre.  Room was modern, clean and the bed was large and comfortable.  Service was just ok, staff pleasant but not overly helpful or attentive. Had to ask a member of staff to take our cooked breakfast order after a long wait and being ignored by a number of staff.

226,great hotel,"stayed at fitzwilliam july 11th till 14th excellent location ,staff very nice .rooms very spacious.never ate in hotel this year as was meeting friends but ate there last year food was very nice.hotel next to opera house,and bus station /train station.",5,2013,07,16
226,Get a corner room.,"This was the nicest hotel we stayed in inIreland/Northern Ireland.  Perfect location, friendly staff, rooms were gorgeous.  Great for a walking tour.  We tend to walk- bit far from Titanic decent walk to the Botantic Gardens.  If stopping in Belfast, great choice.  Sad to go back to the Westin Dublin after a stay here.",5,2013,07,14
226,"Great steak, though comes at a price of 25¬£","We arrived after 9pm in the restaurant ( we did not stay in the hotel and some of the nearby restaurants like home, bar & grill, were fully booked), and there were only a couple of tables occupied. The food was very tasteful, though the portion are modest. It is not the cheapest place in town....The drinks order took a while to get through, as they have to get it from the bar downstairs. The waiters are very friendly.",4,2013,07,14
226,Absolutely wonderful hotel!,"stayed here while visiting family in northern ireland for a little over a week in march. this was my first extended stay in belfast usually i opt to stay in dublin and take the train up. i got this hotel for an extremely reasonable price so wasnt expecting much. i was blown away when i arrived... early check in was accomodated without question, entire hotel was chic, clean and had an over all warm feeling to it. the room was spotless the bathroom was wonderful (had a deep soaking tub they need to advertise this more because it was a huge plus). biggest thing for me was walking in my room and having RTE lyric (classical) playing to greet me. room had a wonderful view of mountains and church.. the bell does ring but it didnt disturb me in the least. the location is ideal. i took in a ballet performance at the historic opera house that is literally attached the hotel. within walking distance from anything you'll want to see. i walked from the train station and it wasnt too bad.i have never reviewed a hotel on here before but this place deserves it and is well worth a visit!",5,2013,07,13
226,"Fabulous hotel, shame about pay parking","Stayed in The Fitz for my partners bday, upon arrival our room was not ready so we were asked to wait in the lounge area & given a free soft drink each- good start! Our room (we booked a suite) was AMAZING! Double showers, big bath, twin sinks, huge bed & sofa & cupboards & full length mirrors & good view! The bar sold THE best cocktails I've tasted & food good also! Staff friendly & location is superb, my only criticism is you have to pay for parking & after getting not much change from ¬£200 for an overnight stay I found that bit much :(",4,2013,07,13
226,This Hotel's Bar is a Culinary Delight,"This venerable Hotel close to the Grand Opera House boasts a modern and friendly bar on the ground level.  While its menu is limited compared to the main restaurant, it's still extensive enough to satisfy your hunger with more than snacks.  Try the chicken pie, made with no pastry but rather clever use of potato and Irish cheddar - large chunks of chicken in a delicious sauce laces with peas and carrots.  Equally satisfying were the chicken Caesar, and the large potions of plaice in the fish and chips.  Under ¬£9 each.",4,2013,07,12
226,Loved it!,"We loved this contemporary hotel. Very quite, well insulated rooms. Plush, new, stylish room and great bathroom with shower and separate bath. All new fittings. Fabulous breakfasts and wonderful staff. Location is very central.",5,2013,07,11
226,A two night stay.,"Whilst only a couple of nights at the hotel the service from the staff was fantastic.
We ate in the restaurant each day and the food was spectacular.
A nice clean place with great d√©cor.
Highly recommended",4,2013,07,09
226,5* Secret Escape - perfect choice!,"Stayed here for a night with my mum. We had a wonderful stay. Room was spacious, clean and beautiful boutique decor! Bed was very comfy and we had a room on level 7 which gave great views over Belfast. 

On arrival we were greeted by very friendly staff. We arrived at 11am and expecting to leave our luggage in the baggage room, however to our surprise the room was ready - this was great!

Location is excellent. We travelled by train so we were a 2min walk from Great Victoria Street. 5min to city centre.

Will definitely return :) and recommend to family and friends :)

We booked through lastminute.co.uk and picked secret escape package - highly recommend :) 20% discount off room price.",5,2013,07,09
226,Not quite 5 star,"Excellent position for City Centre and if coming off the bus from City Airport it is just around the corner.  The staff were very friendly, polite and nothing was too much trouble for them. Breakfast was lovely. Paid extra for package and was entitled to cooked but normally continental ¬£12.50  and cooked ¬£16.50. Lots of choice with both. Had one meal in the bar and it was good value for money. Found drinks in N.I. Quite expensive.  The hotel room was very clean but extremely warm and had to have the air con on all night which was pretty noisy. Bathroom had bath and double shower stall.  Good hairdryer, iron and board in room and proper wardrobe. Plenty tea and coffee making items and CD player plus a t.v. nly downside is that the corridors are very dark and dimly lit all day. Lighting in room also pretty dim.",4,2013,07,07
226,Here we have a hotel where service matters,"Stayed here for a conference in Belfast.  On arrival I was met by a reception staff who immediately let me know that I was welcome and that anything I needed would be made available to me as quickly as possible.  Not the first time I have had such a welcome but this time it was real and here is why.  The first thing was my car keys were taken and my car was parked up for me.  Next to my room and here I found that it was of a very high standard for the rate I was paying and well kept.  Food is served in the Bar and the staff in the Bar were just amazing nothing was too much trouble.  I had a friend with me who said he would like to order Guinness but was a little scared it may not be up to standard, moments later the waitress was back in seconds with a small taster for my friend.  Bar food was excellent.  Finally I needed to book a restaurant and was having difficulty as it was graduation week for the local university.  No problem to the hotel staff I was told to go and enjoy a coffee in the bar and they took my search for a suitable restaurant over found me one booked it and all without stressing me.  Simply great staff in this hotel",5,2013,07,05
226,Very Nice Very Friendly,Arrived at the hotel on Monday and I was greeted by very friendly staff at reception. My car was parked for me and the check in was very good. Staff always  very nice and rooom was excellent. Breakfast was very good and again staff very efficient.,5,2013,07,04
226,Same Hotel - Same Problems,"We stayed here a year ago and had some problems, particularly with the air conditioning, as a result of which, we had a room upgrade this time (unfortunately it was oppopsite the lifts and the noise of the lift arriving was ridiculously loud)
Having said this, the room was very nice but guess what - the air conditioning didn't work again, either in the room or the Bar (we were told by the bar staff that the person with the keys to the cupboard to access the equipment was on holiday and taken the keys with them).
Really need to do something with the seating in the Bar as well - totally unsuitable and uncomfortable.
Won't be staying there again I'm afraid despite the staff being very pleasant",3,2013,07,01
226,Great hotel to stay!!!,"This hotel was a great choice as it was our first time staying in Belfast..
Myself and husband enjoy our stay.. Hotel was a warm and welcome atmosphere ... Very modern and clean... Staff very friendly and rooms are amazing...
Breakfast was lovely and plenty of it... 
We will be back at this hotel... 
Thanks for a lovely stay!!!!!",5,2013,06,30
226,Simply the best!,"What can I say. We stayed sadly for only one night and would have stayed forever. The staff were amazing. Room was superb (OK it was the penthouse!). Cocktail bar was great fun with so many choices topped off with a fantastic meal & even better breakfast.
A very big well done & thank you to Sherif & his team. A must stay if you are anywhere near Belfast.",5,2013,06,28
226,3.5 out of 5,"Pros:
- Great central location, close to City Hall and the Europa bus centre
- Smiling and helpful reception and concierge staff
- Spacious, clean room with comfortable bed
- Contemporary design with some nice touches like the retro phones
- Luggage rack area by the door
- Spacious bathroom with plenty of towels, nice toiletries (White Company) and walk-in shower (good water pressure)
- Free WiFi worked perfectly
- Plenty of accessible plug sockets
- Elegant and impressive ground floor lobby which was popular with guests
- Lots of choice at breakfast (but it is pricey as most hotel breakfasts are). Had the pancakes as part of the continental breakfast, they were very filling (would have been nice to have had a savoury option, say, with bacon)

Cons:
- Limited TV channels. Disappointing given that you can get Freeview channels at the Premier Inn
- As another reviewer has noted, there was surprisingly little shelf space for toiletries in the bathroom. I also wasn't keen on the design of the sink plug (but maybe that's just me - prefer to have either a lever or chain to operate it)
- The desk chair had such soft seat padding that I sank deep down into it! I had to use one of the sofa cushions as a booster
- Was a little disappointed that there were no bathrobes or slippers available
- There was no air conditioning in the business centre on the top floor, so it was stiflingly hot with the PCs running. We had to wedge it open with one of the desk chairs
- I found the dimly lit corridors with mirrors on each room door somewhat unnerving and intimidating

I know TripAdvisor doesn't have half star ratings, if it did I would rate the Fitzwilliam at 3.5. Better than ""average"", good choice for someone who wants to be very centrally located, but I just wasn't wowed by it.",3,2013,06,27
226,Not as good as advertised,"The hotel is nice, but the website promises a boutique hotel full of surprises, and I found an average hotel.

The design of the room was very nice, a little wear-down but still ok. The view from my room was a parking lot. 

Bathroom is big with both shower and bath. TV signal was always ""poor"". My pillow was terrible, but I discover they had a ""pillow menu"", so you can request the pillow of your choice.

Breakfast was great, lots of options for a good price. I also liked the service and the food at the restaurant, but the bar had a limited menu and terribly slow service.

Overall, service was very nice and friendly but not efficient. I asked some questions like ""where can I find a souvenir shop?"" and they didn't know. I also asked help to book an appointment for a manicure and they didn't do it, so when I showed up at the saloon, they didn't had space.",3,2013,06,27
226,Good location but not really 5 star,"Stayed at the Fitzwilliam as we were attending a function in Belfast and the hotel is centrally located and close to the city centre.  Prior to arrival, I looked on the hotel website to find GPS co-ordinates for satilite navigation but there were none so I 'phoned the hotel and the staff member did not know what I meant and said so.  She seemed baffled as if she had never heard of such a thing.  
The rooms are nice but small and water (or robes & slippers) are not provided which one would expect from a 5* hotel.  The room number is difficult to see due to the very poor lighting in the corridor.  Parking is expensive but McCausand's car park is nearby which is a bit cheaper and they will give you a discount if you are a hotel guest (proof such as a hotel key is required). As it had started raining, we were given complinentary umbrellas at reception on the way out which was very helpful.  My main gripe is with the bathroom - there is only a small shelf for toiletries and no room to put your own items.  As the shelf was above the basin and in close proximity to the toilet, there was a good chance that things would fall off the shelf into the toilet or on to the floor.  The non slip surface in the shower had started to peel off and there remained only patches around the edge of the shower floor.  Also, a used shower cap from a previous occupant was hanging up inside the bathroom door.  Could be a better standard overall.",3,2013,06,25
226,"Fantastic hotel, great location","Can't fault this hotel in the slightest.  First class, staff very nice nothing was a problem. Restaurant was very impressive and the special offer meal for 2 was fantastic.  Will defiantly be back in the near future",5,2013,06,24
226,A Wonderful Beginning,"Our night at the Firtzwilliam was a delightful beginning to a two week tour celebrating my 60th birthday.  We were greeted warmly during the quick registration process and escorted to our room. Our room was tastefully decorated, quiet, and quite comfortable. The staff could not have been more helpful and caring.  - a lovely place to stay in Dublin",5,2013,06,24
226,Overnight stay,"I would Highly rec-amend this Hotel and would go back in the future. 
Grate place to stay and all the staff where happy and helpful .
Dinner was lovely and there was a Grate variety of food for breakfast too.
Within walking distance of the main shopping maul Victoria Square. 
Would rec-amend getting a cab if going to the titanic center.

The staff where very helpful. I think it was Sarah and Aishling at the front desk 
and Dermot on Valet , Its nice to not have to worry about finding parking .",5,2013,06,24
226,Fitzwilliam Hotel Belfast Great Location,"Ideally located in centre of Belfast. Most tourist sights all within walking distance. Ideally located for the lovely water front and shops. Very friendly reception staff. Use the porters for local information as they are local.Room was nicely set out with large bathroom with separate shower and bath area. Actually room was very clean was plenty tea, coffee etc. some channels on TV were poor signal,however not there to watch TV. Breakfast was excellent with plenty of choice and lots of  staff on duty. I had two evening meals both were excellent quality.
Only issue I have is the total lack of leisure facilities; a very small room on the second floor with a couple of machines in it. Totally inadequate and not really a 'Gym'. When you compare many 4 star hotelswith pool,sauna,large gym etc this hotel is very poor. However that aside I would recommend this hotel and would stay again.",4,2013,06,24
226,Modern city centre hotel.,"Great location to explore Belfast. we had an overnight stay in a superior room and would fully recommend it.  The staff were friendly and attentive.  the cocktail bar was very busy but the staff were coping well with the crowds and you didn't have to wait to be served. We ate in the restaurant and the food was excellent and piping hot. The breakfast was served until 11 o' clock on the sunday morning and the selection was great. 
Would really recommend this hotel for couples but not really families.  Would be ideal if you were going to a show in the opera house.
The room was tastefully decorated and clean.",4,2013,06,24
226,Nice hotel,"Stayed here for just one night.  Very nice hotel with a contemporary style and very attentive staff.  Was not fussed on the bar, had the feel of an American diner about it but did sell fantastic cocktails. 

Room was great, just what you would expect of a city hotel however the hotel corridors were black and grey with very dim lighting.  Would be difficult enough for people with poor eyesight I think.

Breakfast was great but again that American diner feel to it.  Maybe I just don't like booths.

I would certainly stay here again.",4,2013,06,23
226,Great as Usual,"This is my 3rd stay there, it was great ... nothing more than that is needed, a great large room with a comfortable bed, free wifi, very nice bathroom, coffee maker available in room and reasonable prices .... Highly recommended",4,2013,06,19
226,Fabulous hotel - we were treated like royalty!,"We stayed here overnight on 08/06/2013 to celebrate my Mum's 65th birthday.  

I spoke to the hotel directly and was very impressed with the booking procedure.

The experience started as we were met from teh taxi and our luggage taken inside for us.  The reception area is beautiful.  The staff were all so friendly and nothing was too much bother!

The location was perfect, the decor was wonderful, the bedrooms were gorgeous!  Breakfast was superb!

Wouldn't hesitate to go back, in fact we wish we'd booked for two nights!

Thank you Fitzwilliam Hotel!",5,2013,06,18
226,Our first and last stay at the Fitzwilliam Hotel.,"We stayed in the Fitzwilliam on 01/06/2013 for one night.  
As we were at a wedding on this date we stayed in the hotel for convenience.  On arrival I found the staff at reception very helpful, which made our check in quick and easy.  We were in the hotel only for 5 minutes until we had to leave to attend the wedding.

Things then started to go done hill on our return later that night.  When we returned to our room we went to the mini bar to purchase two bottles of water (as there was no bottles provided in the room which most 5 star hotels do).  But we discover even the mini bar had no water, so my wife phoned room service which put her through to the hotel reception desk.  She asked if someone could bring some water up to the room, but the male member of staff said ""no you can't"".  My wife said sorry what do you meam we can't, to which he replied you have no credit.  We then asked if can we come down to the bar to get water and the reply again was ""no you can't"". We said we simply wanted some water as the mini bar didn't have water.  We were then informed by the member of staff that we shouldn't even have access to the mini bar and it should have been locked!

We then said well tell us what we need to do to get water, would you like a credit card number?... he said yes thats what we need (why could he not have said that at the start and not simply say NO to every question?). So eventually we recieved our water.

As we had pre paid for the room at the time of booking, we only had to pay for the water and carparking (which I will get on to later) the next morning, which I did in cash.  It wasn't until a few days later my wife noticed the Fitzwiliam had taken ¬£50 from her credit card.  She phoned the hotel to explain the situation and the hotel said they hadn't taken any money and that she should check with the card company.  She told them money had been taken as it was on the card statement, which they again denied. So to keep the hotel happy she checked with the card company.  The card company confirmed that the hotel had taken the ¬£50.  So we got back onto the hotel again to explain.  Eventually they said yes one of their tills was ¬£50 over that night and the money will be refunded.  The duty manager said if we stay again we will be upgraded and provided a bottle of champagne, but we said we wouln't be staying again.

That was over a week ago and the money still hasn't been refunded, while we are still being charged interest on the payment.  So we will have to call the hotel AGAIN.

Apart from that, there was no slippers or dressing gowns provided in the rooms.  Rooms are fine but a bit stuffy even with air con on.  The other issue I had was with the carparking.  I was charged ¬£17 to park the car for 24 hours which I felt was expensive considering I was a guest at the hotel.  

Overall it was and still remains a poor experience, in what is claimed to be a 5 star hotel - which it is not.  It's in a great location but unfortunately for the few good members of staff their colleagues let them down.  As a result I would not recommend the hotel or stay again.  The management of the Fitzwilliam have a lot of work to do, starting with their customer service.",2,2013,06,13
226,Excellent city centre hotel,"My husband and I stayed for one night in this hotel while we attended a business event in Belfast City Centre.  We booked a deluxe room which was spectacular with floor to ceiling windows, and amazing views along the city streets into the city centre.  The room was of a very high standard, modern with an unusual layout with the bath opening into the room through louvre doors.  The bed was extremely large and comfortable and the air conditioning (in one of Belfast's unusually hot nights) worked silently and perfectly ensuring an excellent night's sleep. Valet parking arrangements meant we didnt have to worry about our car and the service was fast and seamless but quite expensive (¬£18 for overnight).  Breakfast was very good - a bountiful cold buffett, and an a la carte hot breakfast service, my husband had the full cooked breakfast and it was of a high standard.  My pancakes were very dry and heavy - not light and fluffy - so this was disappointing.  Service throughout our stay was of a high standard, friendly, courteous.  Staff presentation was good, smart uniforms.  I tried to order a cocktail in the bar when we came back from our business function but was told that they were no longer available.  It was 2am, but in 5 star hotels cocktails should always be available!  I agree with other reviewers that this just misses the top notch 5 star standard for me with a few wee niggles, but overall our stay was of an exceptionally high standard and I would stay again as it is very convenient for the city centre, has parking and the rooms are pretty cool.",4,2013,06,11
226,"Nice Hotel, but the 5* rating is questionable.","I am just about to complete my fourth night in The Fitzwilliam Hotel after arriving here on Sunday evening for my week long business trip in Belfast.

I have identified some great factors about this hotel during my stay. The hotel is very presentable and the reception staff were very friendly and helpful upon arrival. The room itself is a very nice size and in particular the enormous bed and the nice bathroom made this stay that extra bit more comfortable. The free WIFI was a nice touch and it was reliable (which has not been the case in numerous hotels I have stayed with in the past). 

I did not use the hotel bar or restaurant as the location was so central, I was happy to venture out every evening for a meal or a drink. I did use the hotel gym, which is unusually small but it was empty every time I went so I have no complaints!

My criticisms of the hotel mainly revolve around features that were advertised on the website that I booked through (as well as the main site) that were lacking. This included the missing ""complimentary water"" (which was at a ¬£4.70 premium in the room mini-bar!), the distinct lack of 'Cable TV' channels (7 working TV channels is simply not acceptable when Travelodge hotels offer full Freeview with a working TV guide!) and the ""laptop compatible safe"" (which could perhaps hold the smallest laptop on the market). The coating on the base of the shower was also peeling quite significantly everytime I used the shower. The dim lighting in the hallway is also a fine line between ambience and a horror movie (I am not the first person to point this issue out!).

I thoroughly enjoyed the stay, however I do have to question the 5* rating, simply due to the fact that I have stayed in lower graded hotels for similar/cheaper price which offer identical, if not better facilities. The above criticisms that I have mentioned may seem picky and trivial, however in my honest opinion it is small issues such as these that can change a hotel from nice to outstanding.",4,2013,06,05
226,Nice hotel but not 5 Star !!,"We stayed at this hotel recently. Although the hotel is nice, i would definately say it is not a 5 star quality. 
The hotel rooms are nice, not beautiful  although I have no complaints there, however the quality in different parts of the hotel is not so good. 
We only came for one night and so just wanted to relax and have a few cocktails in the bar. The first cocktail made to us was very average and I have to say not worth the money. However a different barman by the name of Alan made us some wonderful cocktails !! So ask for him if you go for cocktails .. they are amazing !! I was quite dissapointed however that they did not serve and nibbles to go with the drinks and that half of the light snack menu was not available.
Dinner that night was just ok, the starter wonderful but the steak was not good quality and the sauce .. jus ..gravy, not sure what it was had absolutely no flavour. There was a little lump of melted blue cheese on top which did not reflect the "" Blue cheese and spinich sauce"" which was described on the menu. Dessert was not good, I had the Eaton mess which had 3 small pieces of merangue and a LOT of sauce and cream. My fiance had the sorbet and ice cream although there was no sorbet. They then forgot the cutlery and we had to call someone over to give us some. The staff were lovely in saying al of that. We were seated in a booth which was lovely but were very distacted by the different music going on in the lobby beside us and in the restaurant .. we didnt know which one to listen too !!! 
The price and sitaution are great however i would only probably stay there again if i was to go there for shopping ect. For a nice break away its nothing special !!",3,2013,06,04
226,Grand,"We've just finished a lovely stay here.  The staff were excellent (particular thanks to Catriona at the front desk and Robin in the restaurant) and both the facilities and position were top class.  Nothing was too much trouble, the rooms clean and stylish and the restaurant food was top class - much better than one usually finds in a hotel. Running late for a meeting and stuck in dreadful Belfast traffic, the staff saved us by providing early parking so we could hurry off.  We'll definitely return when next in Belfast.",5,2013,06,02
226,"Great location, was in walking distance to everything in downtown Belfast.","Hotel was great, we were able to walk to everything. Many great food choices and pubs nearby. The staff was awesome, friendly and very helpful. The provided directions and helpful advise on everything. The hotel was clean, the rooms were fantastic, bathroom was huge and great!!! The food is the restaurant for dinner was not the best but the breakfast was good. Many people have complained about the parking rates but the cost is about the same as it is in any city. In all this was a fantastic hotel, would stay there again",4,2013,06,01
226,A great stay!,"I really enjoyed staying here. The room was nice, the bathroom excellent with a huge walk-in shower. Staff were helpful, concierge went out of their way to be of assistance. Very good business space with free use of computer. One small negative for me was the low light in the hallways - a bit disconcerting at first.",5,2013,05,31
226,very nice,"good location pretty central, top quality rooms we had a type of suite and the floor size along with furnishings is good, breakfast excellent, one of the best, fair size bar did its job, this is as good a hotel for the average traveller as their is",5,2013,05,30
226,"Exclusive, but not!","Having now stayed at the Fitzwilliam hotel twice for business, I found this hotel in Belfast city centre to have an air of being exclusive, but unfortunately is far from it. To be fair, the hotel and rooms are clean, modern and the amenities are good for maybe a 3 star hotel. But it carries a badge of 4 star plus which it definitely is not.
The front desk staff are courteous, not very friendly.
The bed is comfortable and the bathrooms are excellent.
The restaurant is expensive but the food is good. However just 200 yards from this hotel is a restaurant by the name of Made in Belfast which at half the price serves a better and more imaginative menu.
The hotel charges its residents 17 pounds for parking which is unbelievably atrocious. And please do not go by any offers on their facebook page as the Bar and the restaurant do not honour any offers on the FB page maybe because they do not have a clue.
However I will use this hotel in the future because of simply its situation to my place of business. But I now know to look elsewhere for food and drinks which are a plenty in the city centre.",3,2013,05,30
226,"Great location, great bar, great room","Just spent 4 nights at the Fitzwilliam and had a great time. The room was great, very modern with big windows and a lovely big bathroom. The reception and concierge staff looked after us impeccably. 

Great cocktails in the bar, not cheap but this is the city centre and the service was excellent. 

We didn't eat in the restaurant as had a list of places we wanted to visit but met a chap who said breakfast was incredible. 

Only negative (although a minor point) is that the hotel gets its ambience from very low level lighting throughout, including only very small windows in the bar. 

I would highly recommend the Fitzwilliam. ",5,2013,05,27
226,"Great location, staff fantastic",The Fitzwilliam turned out to be a great choice for our weekend away.  The wonderful concierge whisked the car away when we arrived so no bother locating parking and struggling with luggage.  We were then able to explore Belfast by foot for the weekend.  The rooms were really comfortable with everything you could need.  Staff were amazing in their friendliness and helpfulness.  I even left a piece of jewellry in the room and when I phoned about it nearly a week later I discovered they were still holding it and a few days later I received it in the post.  Just another example of the professionalism of the Fitzwilliam.  Only quibble would be the heat in the restaurant - we nearly passed out each morning over breakfast which can be really challenging if you've been on the tiles the night before!  The breakfast itself was a great spread.,4,2013,05,27
226,Luxurious hotel set in a great location,"I have stayed in this hotel 4 times over the past 2 years.
Everything about this hotel screams luxury.
Cocktail bar.
Huge, comfy beds.
The decor in the rooms.
Food.
The 5 star service from staff.
It all adds up to being the best hotel in Belfast.",5,2013,05,25
226,What a wonderfull discovery,"We picked the Fitzwilliam in Belfast because it looked new and was a reasonable price range. What we got exceeded our expectation,  A modern hotel with the service you expect from a owner operated inn. Everything about the Fitzwilliam is above average. Great staff, Location, next to the Opera House where we secured tickets to the play. Will stay there again in Belfast and in Dublin.",5,2013,05,23
226,Class City Centre Hotel,"this is a classy modern hotel, ideally located in the middle of busy belfast.  
we got a little lost on our way but were given great directions by a friendly receptionist.  check in was efficient and too the point, offering all the usual info.
the CONCIERGES are wonderfully helpful gentlemen.  nothing was any bother, valet parking and directions.
our room was on the 6th floor.  love the mirrors on the outside the bedroom doors.  our room was very spacious with all modern conviences, including a stereo and min-bar.
the bar is a trendy cocktail lounge, serving some of belfast's many beautiful people.  my wife had a delicious cosmopolitan from a friendly, well knowledgeable bar tender called Jonathan.

breakfast next morning and the following also, were a complete disaster.  both mornings we didn't get coffee for 20 minutes after asking twice.  i got a very poor and overcooked eggs benedict and the staff were in no way attentive, more interested in horse play amongst themselves.

this is a lovely place to stay in this great city.  avail of the amazing concierge service.

we will be back, soon i hope (but might ony stay on a room only rate)",5,2013,05,21
226,Excellent!!,Stayed in for 1 night with friends and had an amazing stay. rooms were beautiful and spacious and very clean. staff were all very friendly and the 2 conceirge were great! Really friendly and helpful. i left my charger behind and they offered to post it out to me. will def be back!,5,2013,05,21
226,Fitzwilliam Hotel Belfast,"Excellent, stayed in a standard room and couldn't ask for more. Lovely location, lovely staff and the valet parking was a dream also. 

Bonus points for catching up with us as we were leaving to return a phone that was left behind.",5,2013,05,20
226,Good Hotel in useful location,"Hotel is shown as ‚Äúnot-rated‚Äù in Belfast tourist information, but from our experience we would estimate it to be on level with other 4 star establishments we have used.  Rooms are large, comfortable, clean and well serviced/presented. Good location, close to Belfast Civic hall and within easy walking distance of restaurants, shops and tourist attractions.  Friendly and helpful staff.  Good bar/restaurant and lounge area.
Only downside was the price of parking - ¬£15 to¬£17 per night (only paid slightly more than that to rent the car, for the day!).  One tip/piece of advice is not to use hotel parking, but to drive 30 metres further west along Grosvenor Road (B38) and park (on right hand side of road) in McCausland (secure/manned) 24 hour car park.  If you show a proof of staying in a local hotel (e.g. door pass), you can park from 5 pm to 10 am for the sum of just ¬£5 for the night.",4,2013,05,17
226,Brilliant central location and friendly staff,"I stayed with my 14month old daughter and our stay was excellent from start to finish.  The Hotel is so well located right in the city centre and with parking available.  Very modern and clean hotel.  
The breakfast was very nicely presented and great selection with friendly helpful staff especially with my young daughter !  
Dinner was excellent in very relaxing surroundings.
Overall we had a very enjoyable stay here and will definitely return, the staff are a credit to the hotel and management.",5,2013,05,15
226,Great hotel,"My fiance and I stayed here for my birthday in January,  I thought it would be quiet with it being just after christmas and I thought. People wouldnt have they money but I waz wrong! There was a fantastic buzz in the bar cocktails were gorgeous!! We had way to many! My fiance is more a beer or grey goose drinker and he even had a few cocktails! We left the hotel to go to am pm for dinner it was lovely and we stopped at a few bars but we couldn't wait to get back to the hotel! We stayed in the residents bar to late, and we didnt have to check out until 1:00. Pm brill a nice long sleep! The rooms were big and modern clean and staff were so nice esp bar staff, there cocktails were too good, cant wait to go back!",5,2013,05,15
226,A beautiful hotel - perfect for a special weekend away,"My boyfriend booked us into the Fitzwilliam as a surprise to celebrate my 30th. We normally stay in more basic places, so it was a treat to stay somewhere more posh! 

When we arrived late on Friday night, the staff on reception couldn't have been more welcoming - they were very friendly, and happy to help with everything from recommending restaurants for the next night, to directions to the Giants Causeway and were so enthusiastic about both the hotel and Belfast. 

The room was beautiful - black, white and yellow sounds like it wouldn't work as a colour scheme, but it did here. As we walked into the room some classical music was playing - we eventually tracked it down to a stereo in the wardrobe. It's little touches like this that make the Fitzwilliam so special. 

The bed was huge, and very comfy, and there were black out curtains so we slept soundly. My boyfriend had asked for a room with a view, so we were on the 7th floor. 

The lobby was beautiful, and the bar menu plentiful and well chosen with a nice buzz in the bar. 

The breakfast was very tasty too! 

There's only a couple of minor negative points to report - 1. The parking was expensive at ¬£17 a night (we got round this by using the nearby carparks - thankyou parkopedia!), and 2. The cafetiere in our room didn't work (a very small point indeed, given that I have never been provided a cafetiere in a hotel room before). 

Altogether, it was a perfect base for our weekend in Belfast. We rarely return to places, as we'd always rather check out somewhere new, but we might have to make an exception here!",5,2013,05,14
226,"High Expectations, Moderate Result","My husband and I wanted a night away in Belfast, we had reservations made in a nearby restaurant and had organised to go on the historical pub tour of Belfast, so much fun may I add!! Anyway we booked the Fitzwilliam through Booking.com for ¬£115 Room only which I suppose is expensive but we thought ah well its a treat.  We parked at McCausland's car park nearby and it was a saving of ¬£5 opposed to parking the car in the Fitzwilliam car park.  On production of your hotel receipt you get a discount.  

Upon entering the hotel there was a strange 'off' smell in the foyer. Not sure what it was, checking in was straight forward and we were on the 5th floor of the hotel.  The lighting on the corridor was very dim leading to the room, to me this is a good sign of how to hide bad housekeeping!! Room was adequate size, quiet location, lightts and air con in the room  was hard to master especially the lights.  Crisps in the mini bar were a rip off at ¬£2.40.  The room was clean and the beds/pillows were comfortable.  

We didn't eat at the hotel but we had cocktails in the bar, strong smell of toilets upon entering the bar, maybe this was the smell in the foyer!! Cocktails were enjoyable and the bar staff were friendly.  Not many people about so the hotel was somewhat dead in atmosphere.  

Overall I think the R/O rate was overpriced, staff friendly, great location but was not overly impressed with decor, smell or ambience within the hotel.  It would not be high on my list for a return visit, however if they did better offers we may return if the price was right especially when you compare great weekend deals from other hotels within the city.",3,2013,05,13
226,Absolutely klass!!!,"I took my fiance down to the fitzwilliam last night for his birthday an what a place! From the moment we arrived until we left we were treated like royalty. At the front desk when we arrived the lady at reception was so friendly and even took the time to change our room from 618 to 719 for the view without us even having to ask. Bar staff were very friendly an always smiling, all staff were so pleasant and we'll definately be back for the best nites sleep eva again :) p.s the breakfast was first class. A huge trolley was wheeled into our room at 10 this morning and it was full of tea coffee cereal and a full breakfast. Definately would recommend this hotel to anyone. Everything was first class and by far the fitzwilliam is the number one hotel to stay in belfast and weve tried a lot :) so cant wait until we get back :) x yvette",5,2013,05,12
226,Long weekend stay in belfast!!!,"Great hotel with absolutely perfect centre to the city, great breakfast and very beauiful bedrooms.food in resturant was nice, staff at bar were ok not as friendly as the concierges when you arrive esp Gerard mush older gentelman that is so warm and friendly took our bags to the room and anytime we saw him through our stay he was always smiling Spoke very well of belfast and the history of the hotel also aranged our taxis to and from the nite club.was very disapointed we didnt see him on our check out and was greeted by other concierge Declan that wasnt happy to help us was checky and rude to my partner maybe hes not a early morning operson like gerard!!!.   We would come back to the hotel again in the summer but we wil book through gerard as hes worth coming to visit belfast for. 
We are only giving Excellent on this review for for Gerard the concierge!!!

226,"Great Location, Lovely staff, good ambience.","We stayed here in April 2013 for a weekend.  The hotel is definitely in a brilliant location, literally 10 mins walk to everything.  We tried to get a taxi back to the hotel on Friday night and the taxi driver told us we would be quicker walking due to the new driving system in place.

5 mins by taxi from the central station but literally next door to Great Victoria Station.  Plenty of taxis around the corner if needed.

The staff are so friendly from check-in to check-out.   Concierge always greets you on arriving and leaving the hotel.   The bar staff were also excellent.   The Bar has a great atmosphere to be honest with a good buzz to it.   Drinks are not over the top either.

The Lobby area is not quite 5* to me although the fire area was lovely, it appeared to always be reserved.   The rest of the seating area wouldn't particularly entice you to sit and have coffee and read or chat.   

Our room was very nice on the 07th floor, very comfy bed, good facilities and gorgeous fresh coffee and cafeteria.   Nice view from our room.  Nice big bath and rain forest shower.  Iron and board, hair dryer, safe, tv, minibar all the usual facilities you would expect.   I did notice there  was a number of marks on the furniture and the few holes in the net curtain and scuffs on the walls which just took away again from the 5* feel.   

We didn't eat at the hotel, but did try to get food before we left on Sunday but the bar didn't open until 1230 which was disappointing.   So we just headed back for a 1pm train instead. 

I would definitely stay at the Fitzwilliam again and I would recommend it to people also, no problem, they just need to keep an eye on little issues around to hotel to maintain standards.

The maid hoovering the hallway at 9am on Sunday morning didn't go down too well either!!!!!",5,2013,05,08
226,Fantastic!,"Great hotel with absolutely perfect customer service.  Lovely foyer, great breakfast and very good  bedrooms.

Not much else to say really: the location was excellent, the breakfast was the best   I ever got in NI, and the rooms were spacious and well fitted.

Would definitely go back.",5,2013,05,08
226,Excellent location,"Stayed here recently and this hotel is really lovely . The staff were excellent and very welcoming especially the receptionists.
It was booked for us as a present and included an evening meal.
This was a very disappointing experience. The food was poor quality. I ordered a steak and it was the smallest piece of steak I have ever seen.It was charred as well. The other people in the company ordered salmon and their meal was equally disappointing.
Presentation of food was average.
Service in the restaurant was extremely slow ,to the point that we almost missed the show we were going to and we did not have time to order  tea or coffee. We had our meal booked for 5.45 and at 7.10 we had to ask for the dessert menu. Show was at 7.30.Would possibly stay again for the ambience ,but would eat elsewhere.
A bit of entertainment would also be nice in the lounge.",4,2013,05,07
226,Very Good Hotel with Excellent Staff,"Myself and my wife booked in for two nights over the May Bank holiday weekend, We stayed in a suite on the 8th floor, The suite was very good with a bath tub a large double shower and all the extra room you would expect in a suite, The free wi fi worked a treat, my only problem with the room was the TV Channels available and the quality of the reception, both were very poor, 
The staff in this hotel were excellent from the Concierge to the reception staff to the bar staff all excelled in their job, we really enjoyed our stay in Belfast and this hotel, Well done to all the staff.",4,2013,05,07
226,Great hotel...not so great customer service,"This is an impressive hotel. The decor from reception to room is amazing and probably as looks go, my favourite hotel. Check in was quick and simple, the concierge took our car keys and the car was whisked away. Our room was very big and was a corner room which had floor to ceiling windows on both sides. As far as the room design and facilities go, you want for nothing here. The bathroom was big with a large walk in shower and separate bath. They have put a lot into the design of the rooms and it shows, you WILL love the rooms!

However we were staying in March when it was very cold, and the heating/air con packed up. The night porter came straight up to the room and was very helpful but couldn't fix it so he came back with a convector heater. The heating was meant to be fixed but wasn't and so we were cold for the next night too. When we asked for another heater (the downside of a big room!) they didnt have any more and were offered blankets. 

The night porter also confirmed that our room did not have any Wi-fi signal in it - however we did have a good reception for Jury's Hotel's Wi-fi which is across the road - if only we had the log in details.

The shower was excellent at the Fitzwilliam and was always hot and powerful. Did try and have a bath however the water was only warm and not hot like the shower. 

We didnt have breakfast at the hotel however we did use the bar which was very ""swanky"" and on our first night, the happy hour with half price cocktails was something not to be missed. As a result of the nice time on the Thursday night, we brought the family we were visiting to the hotel for a drink and food in the bar on the Friday evening. The bar staff took a look while to warm up (and were maybe too eager in the end clearing plates from the table when we were still eating) but the main issue was with someone in the bar who had clearly had too much to drink and ended up on our table uninvited being very loud and swearing. Security did arrive after a while to sit  her down however she came back to our table, with very inappropriate language for a family gathering and eventually she was removed - although a little too slow in my view.

So all hotels can have issues, it's the way they are dealt with that is important. At the time of check out we mentioned our experiences and the duty manager made a change to the bill which turned out to be a ¬£30 reduction......on a ¬£600 bill! I did write a letter to the hotel afterwards to detail what had happened, but it's over a month and they havent replied. I also sent them feedback using the ""Prefered Hotels"" website and have not had a response from that either. 

I am sure most people staying will not have drunks in the bar, will have heating and will get a wi fi signal and will have plenty of hot water........we were just unlucky. Just a shame they cannot be bothered to reply to mail or email.",3,2013,05,06
226,"Such a pleasant experience,","Had a most pleasurable experience recently when I had lunch and a couple of pints of double in the bar of the fitzwilliam. I had a bowl of tomatoes and basil soup, with chicken sarnies, both fabulous.

However, the key element of this experience were the staff, they are all such a happy friendly bunch, really made what was expected to a fairly unremarkable lunch most remarkable.

Well done guys!",5,2013,05,06
226,Another Lovely Stay,"Ive stayed here a few time now and again I wasn't disapointed. From check in to concierge, the friendliness of the staff was second to none. Really made you fell at ease. 
Rooms are spacious and well designed. Stylish bathrooms. Although our view wasn't too great we still loved our room.
We had dinner which was excellent and Aidan our server was exceptional. I went with his fish recommendation and was not disappointed and my other half had the beef fillet which I say was excellent too.
Breakfast the next morning was also a treat and with pancakes and porridge made to order.
Overall a great weekend and we will be back. ",5,2013,05,05
226,Super service!!!,"The Fitzwilliam Hotel in Belfast was excellent.The receptionest was very accomadating and helpfull,the hotel is very modern and the food is five star.The location is very central its just two minutes walk to Victoria Square the shopping centre,it was not noisy at all at night and also very clean.My room had a TV,a small desk witha light and sofas.I would return to this hotel when ever i go back up to Belfast and you should go too!!!",5,2013,05,04
226,good value and good people,"I generally stay in chain hotels, and generally american chains (Hilton, Marriott etc).  This place was booked for me and it was a really nice surprise.  Inexpensive, clean, contemporary, good location.. all good... the room was european in style, smaller than american, dark corridors. but was very well equipped and very comfy.  I would definitely return.  Oh the only negative is the gym.. or ""small hotel room with one of each machine"".. otherwise great",4,2013,04,29
226,great weekend,"we spent the weekend at the fitzwilliam hotel in belfast.what a stay pure 5star,i cannot praise this hotel enough ,beautiful hotel ,and the staff were fantastic, the young lady who cleaned our room could not have done enough for us thank you all so much .",5,2013,04,29
226,Fitzwilliam hotel belfat,We were married on 4th may 2012 and had r reception in Am pm upper Arthur street we chose to stay in the Fitzwilliam hotel Belfast on r wedding night much 2 r disappointment. On r wedding night we were declined cocktails even tho the residents bar was still open. The next morning breakfast was ok but eggs were congealed we then asked for room service only 2 b told that the staff were 2 busy n we would have at least a 2 hour wait! We checked out and after a few weeks I phoned 2 express our concerns and after a few phone calls from us and a few emails we eventually got an emAil from Gemma o'connor offering us an upgrade and meal. I actually tried 2 book this but was told Gemma would be in contact..... That was 6 months ago.,1,2013,04,28
226,Really liked this hotel,"This is a very modern, smart hotel well located close to Donegal Square.  I really liked my room-the decor, furnishings and lighting have been particularly well chosen.  It manages to be stylish and comfortable at the same time and completely avoids that modern hotel ""sameness"".  I had a light meal in the bar at night which was good and breakfast in the morning was of a high standard.  Staff friendly and attentive throughout.  I will certainly be back at this hotel both for business and for leisure stays.",5,2013,04,27
226,Great location,"Really modern hotel with comfortable rooms. Staff were helpful and pleasant. Car parking is expensive however it is the city centre so what do you expect. Breakfast was good, we didn't dine for dinner as the choice in the city is excellent, visitors must pop into the Crown bar across the street to see the amazing decor.",4,2013,04,26
226,"Lovely room, good location.","We stayed here Friday and Saturday last weekend. The room (202) was large, stylish, clean, and had a nice large comfortable bed. The room had good space for bags etc. and when I rang for robes and slippers on Friday night the reception and accommodation team were very helpful and attentive. Room 202 was on the corner of the building so had impressive ceiling to floor windows on two sides. I liked the hotel and the room. The downside of the room is that the TV signal is rubbish, grainy and annoying picture. The largest problem we had was that there were road works outside the hotel until late into the evening (gone 10pm) and on Sunday morning they started again at just after 6am!This was very disruptive as the noise and the tar smell infiltrated the room and made sleeping very problematic. It was constant noise (although not the hotel's fault). So, if you book this hotel I would ring and check what the situation is as it is on a busy junction in the city centre. So all in all, a nice hotel, good value, and clean and tidy. Some of the front staff could do with a little extra, but (excluding the road works) we had a nice stay and would go back.",4,2013,04,23
226,"Great location, friendly staff, cocktail bar...who needs more?","This hotel is deceptive as from the street it just looks like another office building. Walking through the front door you get a sense of modern opulence with a warming open fire and a friendly welcome from the front desk staff. The hotel manages to combine the traditional with the modern in a very relaxed and unpretentious way. 

The rooms are well decorated, the bathrooms large and well equipped with very comfortable beds. The only small point of criticism is that for such a modern fit out they have missed the opportunity to add a docking station for iPods. 

The breakfast is excellent with a buffet continental style and then a full hot breakfast cooked to order. We didn't have dinner in the restaurant, but the bar staff create some great cocktails with an extensive menu to select from.

All in all this is a fabulous hotel for a city break or if staying on business. It's well located without being too noisy and has the friendliest staff!",5,2013,04,22
226,Lovely hotel in central location,"The Fitzwilliam is my favourite hotel in Belfast - and I have stayed in many of them! The staff are friendly and welcoming - nice lobby where you can sit and relax. Rooms are excellent - fluffy duvets, nicely lit with plenty of power points to charge phones/laptops. Free wifi. Bathrooms are excellent - black mosaic tiles but despite the dark decor, the lighting is good. Full size bath and separate large shower. Bar has good range of cocktails and wine - with good service - not too obtrusive but there to take your order when you are ready.",5,2013,04,21
226,5 stars all the way,"At first sight, this inconspicuous hotel turned out to be a great stop on our Irish road-trip. Everything from the valet parking to the turn down service was phenomenal. King size beds, robes, great bar and central location. By far Belfast's best hotel.",5,2013,04,21
226,Cracking hotel in the middle of Belfast.,Lovely hotel in a great location.  Bar and restaurant great and a  really good breakfast with a very wide selection.  The only thing I didn't like was the corner of the bed was covered by the duvet and where it  sticks out you can't see it and I kept banging in to it. Also there seemed to be a lack of power points in the room.  I will be staying at this hotel again and recommending it to others. We were lucky as we got a great deal and so it did not cost the earth.,5,2013,04,19
226,5* treatment,"my partner and i chose to stay at the Fitzwilliam hotel in march this year ,,we had three children with us all under 5 so we weren't really expecting to have a great experience,, upon arrival we were met by a lovely guy who happened to be the conceriege at the hotel his name was declan, he got us checked in with no hassle he helped us 2 r room with our baggage and the children which was a lot,, when we got inside the room it was better than we thought, it was beautifully decorated and the view was amazing and we had everything we needed, before leaving our conceriege declan made it quiet clear that if ther was anything at all that we needed during our stay in the hotel just to pick up the fone and he would sort it out for us,,which we done quiet alot and true to his word he was at r door in 5 mins with watever we needed,, he was a true gentleman any1 who has children would understand how much we appreciated this as use know how hard it can be taking children out of ther usual surroundings.. everything all in we had a lovely stay here the treatment we recieved at this hotel was 10/10, and the staff cannot do enough to accomadate you i will definitly be back and reccommend this hotel to all familys.",5,2013,04,18
226,"Nicest hotel in Belfast, with the best service.","Incredible rooms, great location, and the staff go out of their way to make your stay great (Concierge was very helpful). Upscale bar was nice as was the restaurant.
Did not know there was a fitness centre, nice surprise. Get a corner room for a great view. A little more $ but worth it.",5,2013,04,17
226,"Warm, welcoming, wonderful","Brilliant hotel! Good value for money!! 
staff & concierge's, customer service from checkin to departure was impeccable, very motivated helpful and friendly. 
We had a lovely and plentiful breakfast and dinner in the Restaurant. 
Rooms and bathroom were really nice, clean, temperature was just perfect. 
I have stayed in 6* hotels where  the food and staff where nowhere near as nice as Fitzwilliam. 
We just loved this hotel. ",5,2013,04,16
226,Dinner was D-lish :),"After being in the opera house to see a show my mum and I had dinner in the hotels restrurant,Zara & Katie on reception were both very pleasent and helpful,after a quick drink in the bar which is stunning we went up for our meal. Gavin couldnot have been any nicer,very professional but very approchable,a naturaly lovely guy. I will be back to The Fitzwilliam very soon (hopefuly) Thankyou to everyone in the hotel for a lovely evening,a nice treat for myself but an even nicer one for my mum on her birthday. Julie :) x ",5,2013,04,15
226,5*FITZ!,"My partner and I chose to celebrate our 8 year anniversary at the Fitzwilliam Hotel in Belfast at the recommendation of family who had stayed there in the past.  Our choice was one of the best we have made in recent times.  The Fitzwilliam made every effort to welcome us and ensure we were treated to the same star level that the beautiful hotel boasts.

From start to finish we were treated like VIPs as the Fitzwilliam has possibly the most attentive staff you will find in any Belfast, or further afield, hotel.  The porters and the reception staff had us in our 8th Floor Suite in no time taking in the views over the City and Mountains.

Our room was comprised of a luxurious bedroom, living area complete with TV and radio facilities, a stand alone bath, a sink each along with toilet and shower, which doubled as a lovely wet room to cool down in after soaking in a hot bath, enjoying mountain views.

Nothing was overlooked, as the Fitzwilliam welcomed us with a stunning plate of chocolates in recognition of the occasion.

We enjoyed several cocktails in the bar, after being guided by the expert bar staff, however the highlight of the evening and indeed the stay for myself, was dining in the hotel restaurant.

The Head Chef introduced himself to us, and even complimented our occasion with a glass of champagne and a complimentary course which was out of this world.  I love, but often overlook steak in restaurants for other, perhaps more adventurous options, but this was one occasion where I was glad I stuck with my instincts.  THAT steak was worth the price of our stay alone!  Compliments to the Chef.

We were lucky enough to be shown around the hotel and take in the stunning top floor views, and needless to say this gave us ideas for our next stay.

Our one night stay was rounded off with an amazing breakfast the next morning once again in the restaurant.

The only thing negative I could say about our entire experience at the Fitzwilliam, was that it simply wasn't long enough.

Nothing beats being in our wee town in 5 star luxury, and although I live tremednously close, my partner and I know that we will be back to experience this hotel again.

From the correspondence ahead of our visit preparing us for our stay, to our stay itself and finally to the memories made as a result of spending simply one night in this hotel, I highly recommend that if you are reading this, and have not stayed already, that you rectify this immediately!",5,2013,04,14
226,Fabulous Fitz!!,"Decided to have a night in Belfast with some friends so thought we would treat ourselves to the Fitzwilliam, stayed a couple of times before.
 At check in we were warmly greeted and looked after perfectly, we stayed on the eighth floor in an executive room, which was clean , spacious and luxurious. Lovely large kingsize bed ,with nice linens,a sofa and room to move around. The bathroom was large with seperate shower and bath (even a candle and holder by the bath) all nicely decorated.
 Spent evening in the bar lovely food and great service, superb nights sleep in gorgeous bed, followed by a great breakfast in the restaurant.
  At check out we were asked with real interest how we had enjoyed our stay , and could say with no reservations '' it was fabulous!""",5,2013,04,12
226,Great from entering to leaving,"The staff on the front desk greeted us with a welcoming smile. The manager Killian handled our request for a room change with gracious helpfulness.. The concierge went out of his way to suggest things we might like to see or do. The restaurant staff really made us feel at home.
On top of all that the breakfast fry was outstandingly good.
My third stay at The Fitzwilliam, certainly not the last!1
Can't praise it enough.",5,2013,04,12
226,Fabulous,"Just returned from a two night stay here. We really enjoyed this hotel . It just has the edge over others of a similar standard in the area. The beds are better, the decoration funkier and we enjoyed the food at breakfast. The location is second to none and the staff helpful. Recommend highly!",5,2013,04,09
226,Brilliant night,Stayed for one night to go to a concert. Very surprised to have been offered an upgrade. Stunning room with views over Belfast. Service was second to none. Very attentive and friendly. Staff really tried to make our stay comfortable. Turn down service included. Breakfast was delicious. Plenty of choice. Would definitely recommend the hotel.,5,2013,04,08
226,Excellent place for Afternoon Tea and Champagne!,"What a wonderful experience this was a fabulous venue, sat in front of an ultra modern fire on a white leather sofa, being waited on by a very attentive waiter pandering to all our needs... The Champers was divine  followed by a pot of delicious Tea served with cream Mmm. 
Then came the three tier cake stand with our chosen sandwich selection, then Tier 2 had Fresh Scones with clotted cream and Jam, and  Eaton Mess presented in little cups.. Then the Top Tier was Delicious petit fours to due for.. We could'nt finish it all and were offered a doggie bag!!!! Lol It was a wee bit pricey but a great treat... I can recommend it if your in Belfast wanted something different !!!!!",5,2013,04,08
226,Wow,"Had a great nights stay on fri night for our 30th wedding anniversary,checkin was smooth and very welcoming,the rooms are spacious and wow the view from our room,we were made to feel very special in the restaurant for dinner and the staff couldn't do enough the little extras was a lovely personal touch,food was delicious breakfast was well laid out and very tasty. Thank you to all the staff for an amazing experience we will definitely be staying again..",5,2013,04,08
226,Fiona Fabulous night,"We were a group of seven , here for a big family birthday do , we booked four rooms staying on 5th April , Dinner B&B deal . We all really had and amazing time , we were in one of the deluxe rooms, the view from the room   (  7th floor ) would have blown you away , it was stunning . Even though I live in Belfast and know the area like the back of my hand this stay felt like a real treat as if I was away on holiday ! Sitting beside the fire at the end of the night was really cool . We didn't get to meet the concierge until checkout but all the other staff including Chris in the restaurant were courteous , professional and really helpful , food was gorgeous , 10 out of 10 ! Hey we didn't realise that the hotel had a pool or spa until writing this review we would have loved a wee di
p had we known but next time !!!",5,2013,04,07
226,Gorgeous overnight stay!,"My mum and I decided on a little last minute break away to Belfast and we decided to stay overnight at the Fitzwilliam. I'm really glad we did - it was lovely from start to finish .. we just wished we could have stayed longer. 
We got a lovely surprise when we arrived to learn that we had been upgraded - hotel reception staff were lovely - extremely friendly and chatty. Our room was beautiful, plenty of space with a sofa area. Also this is only a small thing but we loved that you could make your tea and coffee in a pot rather than having to make it in a cup - great!! The bed was huge and the bedding was lovely and soft, very comfortable nights sleep. The bathroom was brilliant too - great size and brilliant shower. 
Location is perfect - very close if you are travelling into the city by bus or train as you only have to walk out of the train/bus station and turn left walk a few steps and there you are. And it is great location for walking to the shops too, just a short straight walk to get to city hall and then you can browse the shops and make your way to Victoria Square. It is ideal for a stay in Belfast. 
Cannot wait to stay again as it was really lovely! Also go and have a cocktail in the bar downstairs - they know how to make a good cocktail. Really great stay!",5,2013,04,07
226,First time in Belfast,"I stayed at the hotel on the 3rd and 4th of April this year in a superior room. The hotel was amazing from start to finish. Every member of staff from concierge to receptionists, waiting staff to housekeepers couldn't have been any more friendlier and helpful.
    The room we had was perfect. A good decent size, well decorated and nice views from the windows. I never tried out the fitness so cant comment on that.
    It was my first time over to Belfast and the hotel was well within walking distance to everything I needed and a short bus journey from the airport.  
    I'd now definitely go back to Belfast again and I'd definitely stay at the Fitzwilliam Hotel without any shadow of a doubt.",5,2013,04,05
226,Fantastic Stay,"Stayed here with my GF on Good Friday 29/03/2013 for one night as part of the Dinner, Bed & Breakfast deal, and had an absolutely fantastic time.
We were very well looked after from start to finish by all staff, but in particular the Concierge Gerard who was brilliant for the entire stay, and also the female waitress who served us for both dinner and breakfast (didnt get her name).
A complimentary upgrade was a great start to our stay, and the room was fantastic, with a very deep bath, and very comfy bed. Food for both dinner and breakfast was lovely, especially the breakfast were the hot food is cooked as you order and isn't sitting in a heater all morning like some places.
We got engaged while we were there and the staff seemed genuinely thrilled for us, rewarding us with a few glasses of champagne, and a specially deisgned dessert as a congratulations.
(Didnt use pool or spa so have rated them as average just)
Overall a very very enjoyable stay, and would come back at the earliest opportunity :)",5,2013,04,05
226,"lovely hotel, great location","My fiance and I have had two stays at this hotel.  The first my partner booked in late October 2012 when we stayed one night as a treat to visit Befast and to my surprise, a proposal! I had no idea it was coming, but I have to admit, from the minute we entered the hotel I was of the opinion it would be a lovely place to get engaged!  we had a lovely room with a brilliant shower/bathroom. we had fantastic food in the restaurant followed by gorgeous cocktails in the bar. the whole atmosphere is comfortable, relaxing with a modern, chilled vibe. we savoured our cocktails out by the fire under the fairy lights off the lobby before retiring to our lovely room where we could play music and relax in the ambient lighting. I won't go into details of the actual proposal, suffice it to say, it was incredibly romantic and I couldn't have asked for anything better!  Our second stay was just this past weekend - my birthday which my fiance booked as a treat and it was just as nice as the last time. The Easter treats to greet us in the room were a great touch (and more than what would have been expected), we ate this time in the bar and the food was fab. as were the cocktails! I have to note, I do love the bath, very deep and ideal for a relaxing hot soak! we have found the staff to be courteous and helpful at all times, and will at some point in the future, be back :)",5,2013,04,01
226,Easter Break,"Excellent break from concierge, reception check in, bar service, breakfast  on Easter Monday and check out what an experience!!!!
All staff were extremely helpful, friendly and experienced. The rooms are tastefully decorated and very comfortable. The service we recevied in the bar and in the restaurant was top class...Our first stay over in Belfast and we will be back. Thank you to all for a lovely Easter...",5,2013,04,01
226,Like the Curate's Egg -- Only Good in Parts,"It's not often that I have such mixed feelings about a hotel, but the Fitzwilliam was both pleasing and disappointing in nearly equal measure.  As a business traveler, I was initially taken with the hotel.  It's excellently situated in the heart of Belfast and it has a hip, boutique hotel vibe that I generally like.  The modern, design-oriented style is carried throughout the lobby and the rooms.  I particularly liked the sitting area off the lobby, which was very inviting with its fireplace and updated library feel.  Check-in and check-out went smoothly and the staff were helpful and friendly.  That said, I found the service to be about average despite the boutique hotel ambience.

My room was pleasingly spacious and comfortable and the bath was also large with a separate bathtub and shower.  Disappointingly, the bed was only so-so in comfort, the pillows weren't very comfortable, and the linens had a faint vinegary odor that I found slightly unpleasant.  There was a small flat-screen tv but it offered quite limited viewing options, some of which were grainy and unwatchable.  The bathroom sink was too hip for its own good and the bowl was simply ridiculous as there was no surface area to speak of nor any shelf on which to place toiletries.  Consequentlly, I had to put my toiletry bag on the toilet.  I was especially annoyed that the iron in the room was a non-steam version; basically, it was a triangular hot plate with a handle.  

The breakfast was very nicely done with a large variety of offerings, and that put me in a better mood about the hotel before I departed.  Still, the Fitzwilliam has areas to improve and I hope attention has been given to some of these areas since I stayed.  I can't, however, say that it would be my hotel of choice if I again found myself in Belfast.",3,2013,03,31
226,Good city centre hotel,"This hotel is relatively near the older Europa Hotel but it is a better option.  Good, bright rooms with tea/coffee and minibar and free wifi.  Friendly staff and pleasant communal areas. There is also a small gym.",4,2013,03,30
226,Just an excellent overnight stay,"We had an early appointment at the City Hospital and thought the hotel would be ideal to avoid the rush hour, it was, 5 minutes to the hotel. Our car was sitting at the front door (¬£17 overnight valet parking excellent value) within 5 minutes of asking.
The stay turned out to be much more. The bed was one of the most comfortable we have had had in a hotel (not the solid block most hotels have).
Food in the bar was excellent value and quality, wonderful stay and we will be back next month.",5,2013,03,27
226,"Great city centre hotel.  U.B., Derry","We had a wonderful stay in the Fitzwilliam on our visit to the ballet in the Grand Opera House on 16th March 2013.  Staff could not have been more friendly and helpful.  We were really bowled over by them!  The hotel was very comfortable and the food was very good.  We chilled there for the whole day, we found it so relaxing.  We had lunch in the bar, which was very good, followed by a very nice dinner in the restaurant before going to the theatre.  The dining room staff very kindly arranged for us to have our desert and coffee after we came back from the theatre, which was actually after the dining room closing time.  Our room was very comfortable.
The only improvement we would suggest is to instal heaters over the entrance doors as there are 2 doors into the foyer which made it a bit draughty as the weather was very cold.
We would very definitely recommend it and hope to stay there again.",5,2013,03,27
226,Might be good if managed correctly,"Modern, simple design with warm decorative elements. The reception is polite, helpful and efficient.

My room (718) was spacious with a huge bed and a decent-sized bathroom with both bathtub and large shower. Missing in the bathroom was, however, a large shelf or sink plate: with nowhere to put all my personal cosmetics, my vanity bag was standing on the floor!

My room had safe, coffee / tea facility and CD player / radio close to the bed. The lighting system was elaborate, with various spot light options, but not fully thought through: I had to get up to switch off entrance / other bed side lights!

The in-room internet connection was free and easy. I liked reading the news in the bed, with a classic music playing, tea at hand and a discrete lighting in the various room areas.

On the other hand, the room temperature was too low for me and the individual temperature adjustment did not help. Car traffic noise was disturbing on the 7th floor as from 4 am.

The continental breakfast started at 7 am only and was spartanic: neither white cottage cheese nor honey, only one type of ham and salami, 2 varieties of jam... 

Nonetheless, I liked the warm atmosphere of hotel and service.

Luck, I guess, was not on my side: the first night, all hotel guests were woken up at midnight and at 3.30 am by a smoke alarm. No instructions followed whether to evacuate the building: some of my colleagues called up reception to check if there was a serious problem. Despite excuses the next morning quoting a smoking guest as a cause and assurances that the problem was solved, the alarm went on again in some rooms the following night...

Another incredible story: at the reception, I ordered a taxi for the departure day at 7.10 am. At 6.40 am, still in my bath, the telephone rang, I rushed, in vain, to pick it up. I had returned to my bath when 3 minutes later a hotel employee knocked at my door trying to rush me down as a cab was waiting ...",3,2013,03,25
226,City centre hotel attached to Royal Opera House,Wonderful stay at this hotel. Very clean and friendly. Stayed on the seventh floor with lovely views over the city and the surrounding hills. The purpose of the visit was to see the ballet at The Royal Opera House and could not have been more convenient. Pouring with rain but did not get wet as so close. The restaurant was good with a varied menu and good wine list. The breakfast was good and the bar meal snacks were also very good. The bar was well stocked with a variety of whiskies.We would certainly stay in this hotel again.,4,2013,03,24
226,brilliant stay in a beautiful hotel.,"My partner and i stayed in the fitzwilliam after receiving it as a gift voucher from our friend. We had a wonderful stay in 702 - the room with the beautiful view! The room itself was stunning, very modern and spacious. We loved the layout. Especially the bath and the views out the windows over the city.
 Everyone was extremely friendly and helpful, especially the lady at desk, think her name was jara. She checked us both in and out from hotel an couldn't b any more helpful with recommending restaurants during our stay.. we had a lovely meal at James Street South. Great restaurant; a must try! We came back full up! Overall great stay and brilliant staff, thank you fitzwilliam.",5,2013,03,21
226,"Excellent Accommodation, Poor Emergency Competence","While I did enjoy my stay at the Fitzwilliam, and felt the accommodation to be exceptional, I must complain about one aspect.  Twice in one night the fire alarm was pulled, and I was compelled to leave my bed and run down four flights of stairs. No reason was provided by the staff: I was merely informed  on both occasions that it was a 'false alarm'.  As I only stayed one night, two alarms meant that I slept no more than two hours at a time.  The accommodation was excellent, very clean and spacious, but the circumstances were most unfortunate.  No recompense or apology was made for the alarms, and for the price paid I felt this to be inconsiderate.",3,2013,03,20
226,Superb Hotel,"I visit this area every year to see family just outside Belfast. I am always uneasy about staying at hotels in other countries, I usually end up spraying the room in Lysol and cleaning the bathroom myself. This is the first hotel I have ever stayed at in both the US or in Europe where I have felt absolutely comfortable from arrival. The room, was ABSOLUTELY spotless. I cannot get over how clean this room, and more so the entire hotel was. The staff was WONDERFUL, ACCOMMODATING, AND GENUINE. The experience here was so relaxing I just absolutely love it. I want to go back! I certainly will be rebooking here next year! A few other ++ the tub is not adequately advertised on their room description IT'S A DEEP SOAKING BRAND NEW GARDEN TUB. I was in heaven. The hotel is literally next to the opera house so I saw a show. The location is wonderful. Close to EVERYTHING. I could go on and on, just take my advice book this hotel you'll love it.",5,2013,03,18
226,Great hotel,"Wife booked this hotel for my birthday. Check-in went smoothly and we got the corner room that had been requested so full marks to Michelle at reception who was courteous and helpful. The full length windows of the corner room allow great views of the busy streets below and of the Presbytery Church building opposite with its lovely chimes and bells sounding out during the day. The bells stopped at 9pm so no trouble with noise at bedtime. 

The room was very well appointed, clean and very modern in appearance. Nice big bathroom too with a large shower and a bath that can be accessed from both sides - now there's a novelty! The concierge then turned up with champagne, courtesy of the hotel, to mark my birthday. This was totally unexpected and shows that the hotel pays attention to guests' reservations and is keen to win their affection.

We ate in the hotel restaurant that evening with the included four-course dinner package. The service was very good and the food excellent. Likewise, breakfast was first class and with a wide selection of products, all of them sourced locally. We commended Robin (who seemed to be restaurant manager) on the service and quality of the food.

All in all, this is a very good hotel in the centre of Belfast, right beside the Opera House, close to the Crown Bar and five minutes walk from City Hall and the main shopping area of Royal Avenue. Even though we live locally, we would definitely visit again for a special occasion.",5,2013,03,18
226,"Perfect location, wonderful staff","My partner and I stayed here in February. The location was superb. Easy to drive to [especially for those not familiar with the city]. Opera house  next door, great pubs across the road &  Victoria square just a short walk away. From the moment we arrived we were taken care of. The car was parked , no problem, check in was pleasant & quick and we were in our room in no time. Just how it should be. The room was lovely with fabulous bathroom - really large for a city centre hotel. The staff were extremely helpful & the concierge was wonderful. We needed a wheelchair taxi early the next morning & it was all arranged without any fuss! Just brilliant. Our stay was made so easy & comfortable I would recommend this as THE place to stay in Belfast. I will definitely be back as it has so much to recommend it. Give it a try, you won't be disappointed.",5,2013,03,18
226,A experience to be treasured!,"What a wonderful, positive and pleasant experience from beginning to end! From making the booking ‚Äì reservations could not have been more helpful; to arriving by taxi from Central Station - greeted by a cheery, helpful Declan offering help and continued to offer assistance all during our stay; to reception who were so efficient and kind and then on to the restaurant for our evening dinner, where the staff were superb and friendly, making us feel very special and valued ‚Äì even at breakfast the following morning my name was remembered and asked how we had enjoyed the previous evening ‚Äì extraordinary!
All in all the management and staff were so wonderfully special, efficient and welcoming ‚Äì obviously hand-picked, this level of service does not come easy or without continued dedicated training with an eye to good customer service.   

We feel we should not tell anyone about the Fitzwilliam, as otherwise we would not be able to get a booking in future! An experience to be treasured.

226,First Class Accommodation & Service,"I've just stayed at the Fitzwilliam to celebrate St Patrick's weekend in Belfast City & I am thoroughly happy with every aspect of the hotel & service provided. This was my first stay at the Fitzwilliam & I will definitely return & recommend it to my Friends & Family!! The welcome extended to us upon arrival was warm & friendly & we were instantly made to feel welcomed. Check-in was efficient, organised & professional & they liaised effectively with the Concierge Team whom were readily on hand to take our luggage to our room & organise out vehicle to be parked. The service was first class & very very Customer orientated! The room was contemporary & decorated in trendy black & line green which although was quite dark, there was sufficient lighting throughout the room therefore this was not an issue. The room was beautifully appointed & had every facility & amenity you could need & wish for & most importantly, everywhere was spotlessly clean! The bed was exceptionally large & the crisp white bed linen was also immaculate, making a very comfortable & pleasant stay. The bathroom had a larger than average bed, along with a separate, rainfall, power- shower. We were on a bed & breakfast rate for two (2) nights & the Irish breakfast on both days was absolutely delicious; fried potato bread, black & white pudding, field mushrooms & fresh tomato, grilled Irish bacon & Irish sausages, all of which was just to die for. There was also a variety of continental meats & cheeses, a selection of breads, pastries, yoghurts, juices & fruit. The food was fantastic & the service was brilliant; again, nothing was too much trouble & the waiting Team all seemed very Customer orientated which is exactly what the Customer expects & deserves. All in all, this hotel was beautiful in every & there wasn't one thing we could fault & being situated upon one of the main streets adjacent to the city-centre it is a perfect location to. ",5,2013,03,18
226,Great expectations,"We got a last minute offer for this hotel and we were expecting a lot for a 5star break. When we arrived we were warmly welcomed by reception. This also included the concierge who escorted us to our room. The room itself was lovely although the large proportion of furniture was black and created an environment which was hard to adjust to. One example was on entrance to the room we had to insert the room pass to activate the electric supply. It was so dark however that we could hardly find the slot for the card! The room however was lovely and well laid out with ample space.
I wondered though if they had considered that as we had got a good offer for the stay, that we were not entitled to the extras such as toiletries and bath robes as they either were in short supply or did not appear. I would expect a 5star to automatically provide same. I felt it was a bit stingy!
Again when we requested the lunch menu in the bar after we arrived we were told that the restaurant was so busy for Mother's Day that they were not serving lunch in the bar. When we were able to have lunch next day, we Were served minus an item in the dish. They must have also ran out. Of ingredients from the previous day!
On our first evening there we would have happily stayed in the bar but it was very quiet so we went next door to the Europa which was brighter and had more of a buzz. It is a very central area where guests can Avail of theatres, bars, shops and transport so it is ideally located. Staff are friendly and helpful. I would not however rate it as a 5 star and would encourage then to pay more attention to the little details like face cloths and extra towels and toiletries in the bedrooms. We only had enough for one person and I felt I shouldn't have  to ring for more. 
I would go back again but only if the price was right .",3,2013,03,16
226,WOW! One of the best hotels I've stayed in.,"Room the moment we arrived we felt like royality. 
We used the valet service with our car which made arriving very easy. The staff were very helpful and the room was amazing. 
We stayed for two nights, and I wish we had skipped our visit to dublin and made a longer stay in Belfast.",5,2013,03,15
226,Nothing short of excellent,"Firstly, anyone thinking of visiting Belfast, don't be put off by the rubbish you read in the press. It is a very friendly, small city and one that you will want to go back to. The Fitzwilliam Hotel is situated in the centre of the city, 2 minutes walk from City Hall, and the attitude of the staff makes it a hotel you don't want to leave. The concierge Declan and his team were superb in arranging visits for us at shortish notice, and advising us where to go to hear traditional Irish music. Nothing was too much trouble for them and they had never heard the word 'no'. The rooms were extremely well appointed, the high end of luxury with a bath you needed a snorkel for; it was that deep. The bed was huge, I reckon it would suit 4 people, and it was so comfortable. The hotel is near a church centre with bells that ring on the 1/4 hours, but on the hour plays one of 28 different tunes, but don't worry it stops at 9pm. We ate in the hotel bar one night, and the food was Michelin star equivalent, excellent Irish food, and the breakfast in the restaurant was delicious too ( I recommend the Irish breakfast).
Reception staff were friendly and fun to talk to, and again no request was too difficult for them, and it was a sad moment when we had to leave them. The concierge will arrange pick ups (at cost) from and to the airports, and will arrange for these to be added to your bill. They will also arrange a shuttle to take you to the start of the hop on hop off bus tour. I certainly want to go back to Belfast, and when I do, the Fitzwilliam is the only place I would stay. You m ust experience it yourself or you are really missing out.",5,2013,03,11
226,Fantastic service! Always welcomed with an Irish smile and humour. Declan went out his way to make our break superb!,"The location, service and contemporary designed hotel is fabulous for a weekend break. The hotel room view isn't impressive but it is a city. Declan from concierge was absolutely brilliant; he designed a compact itinerary for us in minutes to enjoy the highlights of Belfast. Dan our tour guide we highly recommend. Declan booked VIP places for all the hotspots in the evening. From the historical tours, the Irish dancing pubs to fine dining- we thoroughly enjoyed it all! Belfast locals are so welcoming and treated us like friends. We highly recommend The Fitzwilliam Hotel specifically for location and Declan!!",4,2013,03,10
226,Comfortable and Really Clean :-),"We are just back from a stay at the hotel. All staff members were really friendly and welcoming. Our room was very impressive and spotlessly clean. The bed was comfortable and the bathroom was immaculate. The only niggles we had was that some of the furniture was a little 'tired' looking, with the odd mark and scrape on it, also the legs on the frame of the bed sat out slightly, so we kept clipping our toes off them ... painful! It said on the information that the hifi would connect to an ipod docking station, but it helps if you are supplied with the cable required to do this. Not all channels worked on the television, and would sometimes come up 'no signal'. As we were only staying the one night to attend a concert, these were minor issues, and we still enjoyed our time at the Fitzwilliam Hotel. ",4,2013,03,09
226,most disappointing,I have stayed in the Fitzwilliam on a few occasions and this time was really disappointed. The receptionist was friendly when we arrived and room was clean. We requested a newspaper to be sent to our room the following morning that did not arrive. We were woken up just after 7.30am by staff sorting bottle bins (no chance of sleeping through that racket). My husband had a burger in the bar and it was really dry with a handful of dry rocket piled on the plate with no dressing - definitely not what I expect from a 5 star hotel. When we went to check out another rooms food had been added to our bill which the receptionist then removed. Overall really disappointing all round and will not be back.,2,2013,03,05
226,"Lovely hotel, but........","Enjoyed our recent stay at the Fitzwilliam Hotel. Room was large, comfortable bed and lovely bathroom. The things we didn't enjoy were a) they wanted to take ¬£50 credit per night in the bar, and would then credit back onto our credit card any balance left after our stay b) replacing complimentary bottles in the bathroom with near empty ones c) Some of the TV channels were not working all the time. Would stay there again as it was a very good location for public transport and for the city centre.",4,2013,03,04
226,Normally one of my favourites in Belfast,"I have stayed at the Fitzwilliam several times and it is one of my favourite hotels in Belfast.

The location is great, rooms are lovely, free wifi, they serve an excellent breakfast and staff are normally very good.

On my most recent stay it fell way short of any previous visits and was a massive disappointment. The first room I was given was much smaller than any room I have stayed in before and was right next to the lift with a constant noise each time a lift arrived. I moved rooms only to end up in a room where the wifi would not work. On speaking to reception they were extremely patronising and insinuated that the wifi was down to me and not lack if signal. The concierge came to the room so I could prove there was no wifi signal. The 3rd room I ended up in had a generator above it which came on at 7am each morning and made it impossible to sleep any longer.

So all in all not a great stay. The concierge was very helpful and a nice guy but I found a couple of the girls on reception to be a little unfriendly and snooty.

I am back in Belfast soon but will most likely try another hotel.

",4,2013,03,03
226,Had a wonderful stay.,"This is a great hotel with mostly all round good service. The rooms are clean and have most thinks you would need. Only two pillows on the bed more in the wardrobe but with no covers, I'm sure I could of asked for more covers but really shouldn't have to. The reception staff were great, extremely friendly and informative. 
The cocktails at the bar are a must: delicious. Most the bar staff friendly, apart from one sour faced lady that kept pressuring us to settle the bill although we hadn't finished our drinks, this was a complaint of many in the bar that night. Seemed as though she was doing her best to get home early!! Unsure. 
Breakfast was delicious, husband didn't get exactly what he ordered the food made up for that though and again I'm sure if we had raised the issue they would of resolved the issue. 
I'm just raising the issues so as to give an honest review. However, I must say we would happily stay again. The pros far out weigh the cons. 
To finish I would just like to say thank you to all the staff that made us feel welcome and those behind the scenes that keep the hotel running and the rooms so clean which is the main thing we want from a hotel- cleanliness. 
",4,2013,03,03
226,Margaret B,"My husband & myself stayed in the Belfast Fitzswilliam Hotel recently. The hotel was very good, room pleasant and the bed really comfortable.Staff were very helpful and friendly. The only problem we had was at breakfast when to our disappointment we were let down by the cleanliness of the crockery. Quality of the food at breakfast as llike dinner on previous evening  delicious, so would someone please check dishes when they come out of the dishwasher or at least before they get to tables. Having said this it has not put us off and would stay in this hotel again, hoping this was a one off.",4,2013,03,01
226,Good location,"Good location as we travel by public transportation. The bus depot wasn't far ( 1-2 blocks). Great area to walk to the center of Belfast and the Christmarket. Great bars with Irish music.
The service at the front desk can help in deciding where to eat/ drink.",4,2013,03,01
226,Highly recommended,"We spent the night while attending the Grand Opera House (next door). We went for the Pre-Theatre Menu which was great value, 12.95 for two-course meal. The staff were extremely helpful and very friendly. The concierge was excellent and helpful with directions around the city centre. We let the hotel take care of the parking and were able to have them store our luggage and keep the car till 5pm after we checked out, letting us roam the city centre at our leisure. Will definitely return.",5,2013,02,28
226,"Wonderful hotel, great location, fantastic staff","Stayed just before Christmas 2012-  walking distance to everything, including the holiday matket.  Room was spacious and clean.  Staff was Superb, gave restaurant recs and advice for our day trips.  Would stay here again in a heartbeat.",5,2013,02,25
226,Not quite a 5*,"I have been to the Fitzwilliam Hotel in Dublin and it is what I expect of a five star hotel, its sister hotel in Belfast is not. The room we had was clearly tired, the fridge was not switched on and its contents warm. There were not enough towels provided, no bath robes or slippers available.",3,2013,02,24
226,Caring attitude really helped,"We needed a hotel room in a hurry close to the hospital as our father had suffered a massive brain haemorrhage and was dying.  The staff were wonderful, arranging taxis in the middle of the night and fetching our car at short notice at equally unsocial hours.  Their kindness and professionalism made a very difficult and trying time somewhat easier, they really cared.  A big thank you all round.",5,2013,02,23
226,Wonderful,"Price is a bit high, but I would say it is completely worth it. The room was lovely and clean and the bed was one of the most comfortable I have slept in. Staff is friendly helpful. My boyfriend forgot his wallet in the room so we had to return to the hotel after checking out and it was waiting for us at reception. Wish the hotel had a spa!",5,2013,02,22
226,Ok,"I stayed in the Fitzwilliam on 17th Feb 2013. The location is very good, close to everything in the city centre. The rooms are very contemporary and clean. However a few small things could really improve them. Most annoyingly there was only one accessible plug (power socket) in the room. This was rather inconvenient as we both had phones and other items that needed charging. Also the layout of the room meant that the tv could not be comfortably watched from either the bed or the sofa. The room was also exceptionally warm and the air conditioning controls could have been a lot simpler. Finally, and most annoyingly the fire alarm went off twice during the night, both false alarms. 
In short, great location, friendly staff, clean rooms, however some hopfully relatively easily fixed problems spoil the experience somewhat. ",3,2013,02,20
226,"3am fire alarm, and a lack of management","OK fire alarms can go off at 3am, but fire alarms are supposed to go off if they detect smoke. The problem here was that the night porter could not reset the alarm, and no apology was made to guests when we checked out in the morning. I paid for a decent nights sleep and did not get it.

We were woken at 3 am by the loud klaxon in our room, got dressed while the noise continued unabated, and walked down many flights of steps to the lobby. Here we found a Pythonesque scene. The night porter could not reset the alarms, so to keep them quiet, had to stand with one finger on the ""silence"" button, and try to phone the alarm company with his other hand, and at the same time answer calls from guests who wanted to know what was happening, and ward off angry guests who were unimpressed with the handling of the situation. 

Anyway he told us when he had a spare moment that there was no fire, and that we could return to bed. This we did, but 10 minutes later the alarms burst forth again. I had no idea if a fire had really broken out, or the porter had taken his finger of the Silence button. We descended the stairs again, only to find the porter still with one finger on the button, and still trying to call the alarm company with his spare hand. We returned to bed

Anyway next morning when we checked out, the receptionist had a polite but bizarre conversation with us, about what we had done during our stay in Belfast - but no mention of the fire alarms. I paid my bill, then asked to speak to the duty manager. Reception seem bewildered that I should even bring up the subject of a disturbed nights sleep - not their fault they said, but a guest smoking - as if that was my fault, as I was a guest too.

Hotels have guests, and smoke alarms do go off. However staff must be trained how to reset the alarms when they do, and also need to apologise to guests for the disturbance.

I then waited 15 minutes for the duty manage to appear, but in vain. I suspect he was hiding to avoid guests. So I left. 

So it all boils down to bad management. Hotel guests are paying for a nights sleep, when a hotel does not deliver this, then they really should say sorry. And if alarms do go off, then staff must be trained to cope with the aftermath. Bad management - you would not want to be here if they really did have a fire.",1,2013,02,20
226,Exceptional professionalism and service,My wife and I stayed for one night which included an evening meal. Professional service from all the staff we encountered. The meal and attention to service were the BEST we have ever experienced. Any minor problems were sorted out promptly. If this hotel could have captured our visit on camera they could use it in training classes in how to provide a first class service even down to how the Night Porter dealt with some angry clients when the smoke alarm went off in the early hours when some absolute idiot thought it a good idea to start smoking in his or her room. This incident was completely out of the hands of the hotel staff and earned them my sympathy. Some may consider this hotel a little pricey but it is worth every penny to experience such wonderful food and exceptional service.,5,2013,02,18
226,Fantastic experience,"Myself and my mother stayed here for 1 night as we were in Belfast on a shopping trip for her birthday.  As it was Valentines weekend, I was unsure about booking the restaurant for dinner but I am so glad I did.  They had a set menu which looked lovely but included a cocktail which we didnt want so the waiter said we could have the Pre-Theatre menu instead (we were definitely outside the usual time for this). This was a fraction of the cost of the regular menu so it was an extremely nice gesture which we didnt even ask for!  This level of service continued as there was a bottle of wine included in our package and the manager very kindly said we could split into a few glasses of red & white to accommodate us - I know other hotels would not have been so kind (and again we didnt ask - it was suggested when i ordered a glass of red).  Our waiter Alex was very attentive, friendly and professional (as were all the staff).  The food was amazing and breakfast was equally as good with very tasty vegetarian sausages! The hotel is right in the centre but noise isnt an issue (we were on the 2nd floor). Rooms were lovely dcorated and the CD player playing classical music when we checked into the room was a lovely touch.  I have to say that our entire experience was just fantastic and I will definitely be booking to stay in this hotel again on my next trip to Belfast.

If you are staying in Belfast dont book anywhere else!",5,2013,02,17
226,Great location,"Had a lovely time in the Fitzwilliam Hotel. A very good hotel for a central stay in Belfast, everything within walking distance. The hotel is quite a modern design, sharp lines etc. the front of house staff are very friendly on arrival. There is a nice lobby with a big gas fire to sit in front off after a long days shopping. Breakfast is good with cereals, bread, ham/cheeses, pastries, juices, fruit to choose from along with the standard breakfast menu containing your usual cooked breakfast etc. The bedrooms are a very good size, plenty of room and a great shower again in a good sized bathroom. The only issues we had was with maintenance within the hotel. Light bulb missing in the corridor, not replaced even though it was pointed out to staff. No bathrobes in the room, you have to ring housekeeping or reception to get them. This we did but could get no answer from housekeeping and had to ring reception3/4 times in order to speak to someone but still didn't get them. Small things but do expect better in a hotel of this quality. From a parking point of  view, mccauslands car park is 1min from the hotel and have a 5pound overnight rate.",4,2013,02,15
226,Very unfriendly staff,The staff in this hotel did not have the professionalism to work in a 2 star hotel and the night staff I would not put on the door of a nightclub. Hotel nice enough but staff ruined our experience. I can safely say that I will never return to this hotel.,1,2013,02,13
226,Great Location,"we enjoyed our stay at the Fitzwilliam and would have no problem staying there again if we were in Belfast. It's very conveniently located in the city centre, close to everything; it's comfortable with good sized bedrooms for a city centre hotel. Service is friendly, particularly the concierge service. We ate one night in the restaurant which was fine.

We didn't care that much for the bar which we found a pretty odd place but that's probably a matter of personal taste and despite lots of staff it can be difficult to get service. The very comfortable lobby with its large fire would be more to our taste.

There seems to be a suggestion that it's 5 star hotel, which it's definetly not. It's a good 4 star. There were no slippers, bath robes or water in the rooms, all of which are standard in a 5 star. There has been a lot on interior design thought put into the overall decor and look of the hotel which is beginning to show signs of wear and tear (a bit of costcutting?) and the overall attention to detail that is the mark of a 5 star is not there. But they're charging 5 star prices in the bar. These are observations not complaints!",4,2013,02,12
226,Night off disappointed,"My husband and I usually just go out to dinner then home but this time we thought we would treat ourselves to an over night stay in Belfast , we often pass this hotel when in Belfast and thought it was worth a visit  . Being parents of five its was a well deserved treat , on arrival we were impressed beautiful lobby with burning cosy fire staff were friendly on arrival ,we checked in then went to our room which was beautiful designed,comfortable and classy . We had booked a table for 7:30 we arrive on time but as we waited to members of staff ignored that we were standing waiting to be seated, after five minutes we were brought to our seats the restaurant was not busy so didn't understand the wait . Our waiter took our order for food and drinks we waited for our food ??? We notice other people who came in after us had been served there starters and were on there mains we had not yet received our starter 25 minutes had passed I call the manager to make him aware of our wait , he came back after 5 minutes with two glasses of bubbly and an apology that our dock had been over looked so we accepted the bubbly and understood these things happen but the food wasn't worth the wait we were disappointed with the main and dessert was something you would expected a better quality of food from a 5 star hotel our chicken was dry and our dessert was like eating wall paper paste i couldn't finish it I only had two bites but unfortunately there were no staff to be seen in the restaurant ,we eventually left to go to the bar we ordered drinks couldn't believe my luck they had run out of Bacardi :( a five star hotel running out of alcohol ?? I don't think the bar tender could be bothered going to get a fresh bottle . The service truly lets this beautiful hotel down staff our friendly but not highly trained to the standard of a 5star hotel  . We would stay again but as a b&b guess we would leave to go another restaurant in Belfast for dinner",4,2013,02,11
226,Always Good,"Another wonderful stay at the Fitzwilliam Belfast. I have decided its my hotel for choice when staying in Belfast which seems to be every month at the moment.

Checkin was excellent and seemless, the staff are alwasy attentivve, nothing is too much trouble.

The room was well appointed, this time I had a King Executrive room, the bedroom was warm and cosy as it was very cold outside, the bed was big comfy, the bathroom is stunning witgh a lovely walk in shower.

Drinks in the bar were very good, order taken and looked after very well.

I payed for breakfast which I don't usually do as a rule but so glad I did, from the moment of arriving and getting seated promptly nothing was too much trouble. The food was outstanding and very enjoyable, I like the tocuh of giving the customer a newspaper to read during breakfast (well done)

I look forward to my next stay in 3 weeks time!",5,2013,02,11
226,Everything was top quality,"Spent a weekend at this hotel and everything was what you expect from a five star hotel.  The staff were helpful, the valet parking prompt, rooms spotless and food perfect.  Would recommend this hotel to anyone.",5,2013,02,08
226,Outstanding service in a great hotel,"We spend three nights here during our son's wedding. It's a very beautiful and stylish hotel, and very comfortable too. The restaurant is well designed and the breakfasts are really great - best scrambled eggs we have ever had outside our own home! But what has really got me to write this review are the staff - the service was brilliant. Every member of staff was pleasant, smiled at you and clearly ready to help. They were thoughtful and responded really positively to the many small, and sometimes big, requests from our family and friends. A fantastic experience all round. Thank you",5,2013,02,07
226,Shopping trip to belfast,"We had a suite, and the room its self was beautiful, with free standing bath tub separate walk in shower that could have fit 10 people in it.. double vanity sinks and a separate loo so you see it!! 
The hotel is a great little boutique but the only things that let it down is the service, having stayed in many 5* properties world wide, one would expect the service to be good. for instance, in the bar we waited at least 15 minutes for a drink when i finally was served, they had no cocktails, the bartender wasn't sure of what whiskeys they had and was not friendly at all. So we went back to our room and ordered drinks from there rather than be treated so badly, only to discover that the room service menu was very small indeed.",3,2013,02,05
226,Great Hotel,Stayed at the Fitzwilliam with family for the night. The rooms were very clean and modern. Staff were friendly and helpful. They are in a brilliant location with the bus depot and taxi rank right down the road. Most importantly there's plenty of pubs about!,4,2013,02,01
226,Great value for a modern 5 star hotel,"Great location, a lot of place in walking distance. Lovely room, couch is the high light. Not like most hotel providing a tea table and one seated sofa, you can lying in the couch, watching the telly and it can takes up all of we three. Well designed, space is well used. Nice water pressure in the shower, and have a seperate bath with shower head. The design is definitely the best of the hotel. a fairly small reception area comparing to some 5 stars, but well designed. Generally staff are friendly, specially the room service ones and bar staff. But the girl at the receiption on the night we arrived was not that nice. She was fine, we asked if we could move to higher floor level, she did check and arrange it. We arrived on 26th of Dec night, asking her any nice restaurant open for dinner and maybe confirming the car parking issues. She did what ever she suppose to do, but giving us such feeling that we having so many questions and we were just bothering her. We dont feel very welcoming, even I feel a bit afraid to ask any more questions. On arriving into our room, noticed there were only one face cloth. So, the first image wasn't that good, but it improving day by day. Well, for me the biggest problem is parking. They have their own seperate car park at the back, you have to approach concierge everytime you need your car or return your car. One time we have to wait for about 10 minutes, as the concierge is talking to other guests, giving directions I guess. I could not complain that at all, the poor guy is up to his eyes. But our 20 months old son lost his patience and just wanted to go back to sleep. The other thing is the air con, the fan is a bit noisy everytime it's on and off. We stayed ther for 3 nights, overall it's still a good experience for the price we were paying.",4,2013,01,30
226,Great stay,"Stayed at Fitzwilliam for birthday celebrations and had a fantastic time from start to finish. Front counter staff very helpful and we were pleasantly surprised to be upgraded to a suite upon arrival. Room was very spacious with modern decor and no noise from traffic outside. Central location is great as well as you are well within walking distance to shops, bars etc. Breakfast the next morning was delicious with plenty to choose from. We would definitely return and would highly recommend to friends.",4,2013,01,28
226,Comfortable room; very good staff,"There was very good wifi in hotel. Staff were excellent, and could not have been more helpful. Good choice for breakfast. Room was very clean. Very central location. It would be great if there was a pool. ",4,2013,01,26
226,Nice hotel but sadly disappointed!,"I booked the hotel as a surprise for his birthday in January 2013 - I paid ¬£135 for a superior room which boasted more room and a kingsize bed ! I booked this a few days before on their website on the advanced booking tariff assuming I was getting a good deal! However I checked their website on the day of my stay and found that if I had just waited until the day of the stay under the same tariff the room was now 15quid cheaper!! 

On arrival staff were lovely and welcoming. We stayed in room 619 and on entering the decor is modern and bright. Very disappointed with superior room, supposedly more room??? I paid ¬£ 20 extra for a corner window with sofa. I then looked at the 'kingsize' bed to find that this was actually two twin beds zipped together !!!! You could feel the gap when in the bed ! 

The bathroom was clean well with a large walk in shower however the shower tray was a bit tired looking as some lining on the tray was worn away and looked a little grubby. 

There was also some of the carpet pulled up which was a minor thing but I had come with very high expectations so was a bit disappointed with these things. 

The staff were excellent as they sorted out a dispute in my bill straight away no questions asked at checkout the next morning. 

The highlight of the stay was the breakfast. One of the best in any Belfast hotel I have stayed. Cooked to order with a large continental selection , staff excellent  and very attentive. 

Overall a nice stay but better value elsewhere in the city.",3,2013,01,26
226,Great hotel with staff to match,Great hotel with staff to match food to high standard  rooms with great decor nice to here some n Ireland  speaking staff  this is a great place to spend a weekend this is our 5 time  we will be back don't forget. To try the c tails in the bar the bar staff are so good to explane all the different c tail drinks ,5,2013,01,25
226,An emergency booking gone good,"I was working in Belfast and was snowed in on the friday night so the flight was cancelled with a few hundred people trying to get taxis, hotels on a friday, in Belafst etc.
I had walked past the hotel the day before and liked the look of it so found the number and booked a suite on the top floor.  ¬£145
The reception staff were very helpful in making changes to the booking as my rebooked flight was sooner than expected and adjusted the price accordingly.
I had drinks in the small bar which is very well laid out with boothes that hold abut four people either side of a table with a small window onto the street and small bar tables with a handul of chairs.  The bar was full at around 5-6pm but then thinned out to around 15 people.  The bar is very stylish and the staff very attentive all night and keen to talk about the hotel, themselves, Belfast or their home towns as well as showing an interest in my problems and work.  The bar had a good range of wines and spirits as well as a decent cocktails menu.  The bar food menu offered a decent range of staples with the food being quickly delivered.  I didnt try the main restaurant but some dishes from their menu were on the bar menu. The food was tasy and well presented and worth the money paid which is unusual in city hotels.
The room was on the top floor which on a good day should have good views of Belfast as well as the hills in the distance.  As it was snowing, the view was about 10 yards !
The room was stylish and spacious and well equiped with free wifi though the internet through the TV was expensive.  I like a good shower and the room had a very spacious double one in black tiles which looked great.  The room also had a separate roll top stand alone bath for those who want it.  A decent size TV had a sofa in front of it and could be seen from the bed if you wanted to watch TV.
I had to leave the hotel at 5.30am and reception had all the invoices etc already sorted out and a taxi to the airport on standby. 
The hotel is in a good spot and is easy to find.  The Crown Bar is abut 50 yards from the hotel and is worth a visit for its gas lights and small drinking boothes.  City Hall and the Victoria shopping centre with some decent shops is an easy short walk
When I return to Belafst, I will look to use this hotel again",5,2013,01,24
226,Super City Centre Break,"We booked in for a night after Christmas (28th Dec) to celebrate our Wedding anniversary, which I had mentioned to the receptionist on arrival. Shortly after gettng our bags into the room a waiter delivered 2 glasses of Champagne which was a really nice touch.

The room iteself was on the 5th floor (Delux King Room) which had a fantastic view over the hustle and bustle of Belfast City Centre. 
In terms of overall layout, the room was really spacious and modern with a large bathroom and a huge free standing bath which could be opened onto the main bedroom through some tri fold doors.

After sipping the Champagne I ordered up a couple of cocktails which I must say were among the best I've tasted.

The breakfast room/restaurant is really unique with a really urban feel. We opted for the full works so to speak and instead of buffet style hotplates crammed with stewed cooked food, each breakfast is made to order from some vert attentive waiting staff who were on hand to top up our coffee & tea throughout.

Overall I'd recommend the hotel which still has a pristine feel to it.

Can't wait to go back !!",5,2013,01,23
226,Well worth it!,"My partner and I stayed here as a treat to ourselves. Got a great deal as a secret room on lastminute.com. 
The service was excellent and the staff could not have been nicer. 
The only negatives were that the shower leaked and the position of the plugs in the room meant there was no where to dry your hair and use a mirror at the same time...
Overall though we would definitely stay at the fitzwilliam again! ",4,2013,01,23
226,Best breakfast to date,"We visited the Fitzwilliam hotel in December to celebrate our wedding Anniversary. We were greeted by a lovely receptionist who I believed was called melissa, she was able to direct me to all the best shops and couldn't do enough for us over our 2 night stay.
 The room was fab And the views over Belfast at Christmas were lovely. Could have spent the whole weekend looking out the window!
Breakfast the following morning was divine...the hostess brought us newspapers and enquired after our stay, she really made an effort with us to go that extra mile and put our minds at rest involving the recent troubles. Best breakfast I've had in any hotel food and service wise 5* all the way.
Really recommend  Belfast and the beautiful Fitzwilliam, don't let the recent trouble deter you!",5,2013,01,22
226,Good location,"Beware of special offers at this hotel.  We booked a 2 night BB plus one dinner package.  Big fuss at booking over the dinner in the Restaurant.  It had to be confirmed upon arrival at the hotel.  After a lot of faffing around at Reception this was eventually done.  Reception at this property do nothing but give you your key and bill.  Anything else its 'see the concierge' who  are friendly and know their business. 
Well dinner in The Restaurant was a total disappointment that night.  They could not make a Martini, the third wine asked for was the first available and the food was very ordinary and my fish badly over seasoned.  The reply from the chef (who chose not to appear) was it was smoked what did I expect?.  The restaurant was about one quarter full so we concluded that this special offer was more hype than substance.
I see this hotel  posing as something it simply cannot achieve and not seriously 4*",2,2013,01,21
226,The Place to Stay in Belfast,"We booked on 19th January for that night and paid ¬£95 for an executive king room. We then paid an extra ¬£17 for valet parking. We drove up at the front door and a staff member appeared and took our car and parked it. He was very polite and efficient. Check in was swift and professional and the receptionist was very friendly and explained about breakfast and check out times. We went on up to our room on 7th floor and the man arrived a short time later with our bag. He showed us how the heating control worked and pointed out the mini bar which is hidden behind a mirror. The bed was so comfortable, king size with white cotton duvet cover and sheets. The pillows were also perfect for me, quite firm foam. There was a flat screen tv with in house movies etc. The mini bar had a good variety of beer and spirits and jelly beans ! Tea, coffee were also provided. There was a proper hair dryer in the wardrobe (not the usual low power hotel ones). Plenty of wardrobe space with approximately 8 hangers and an electronic safe was also in the wardrobe. The bathroom was large with a giant shower (shower tray nearly as big as the bath), a full size bath with a hand held shower over it. Shower gel, shampoo and shower caps are provided. A very peaceful night's sleep with no noise from other residents. We ordered room service breakfast the next morning ¬£10 each plus ¬£5 tray charge. Well worth it, we ate the delicious breakfast and then had another snooze because check out isn't until midday. Super ! Will definitely stay again.",5,2013,01,21
226,Modern and contemporary!,"I am regularly in Belfast on business and being unable to book into my normal hotel ended up staying in this one. I have to say it was a real pleasure with the decor being fresh and funky,a mock fire in the lobby with comfortable seating and a friendly atmosphere.

The rooms are fairly small but very well equipped and higher up great views of the town and street below.

I ate in the bar and all the staff were very professional, friendly and helpful. Indeed after discussing whiskey with one of the barmen I found out it was ¬£150 a shot!!! I only liked the look of the bottle but he was obviously very knowledgable and enthusiastic about his job which was very nice.

I would definitely recommend this hotel it is in the centre next to the opera house so very easy access across all of Belfast.

My only two criticisms are that as a 5 star hotel I would expect complimentary water in the room and not to be charged ¬£3 for a very small bottle and it cost ¬£17 to park your car overnight! Minor points but they do make a difference.
I will definitely be staying again and have already recommended to two of my colleagues.

Stay and you won't be disappointed.",4,2013,01,19
226,brilliant,"I stayed here for one night on 5th December due to a business trip to the area and I must say it was brilliant, friendly professional staff and as for the decor it was stunning.
I have relatives in the area and when my partner and I visit them next we will be sure to stay here.",5,2013,01,17
226,good hotel in a good location,stayed in the fitzwilliam for one night in january as part of an anniversary trip to northern ireland. hotel is in a very central location and is nicely appointed. rooms were large and bathrooms very nicely done. service was excellent and the bar area and breakfast were both very good. would recommend the hotel and would stay again.,4,2013,01,16
226,Excellent location,"Stayed here in December  to attend concert in Belfast.Staff were friendly and helpful,bar and reception area beautifully furnished,rooms very modern and bathrooms very modern.Location excellent for shopping ,my second stay here and would only ever stay here while visiting Belfast.Cant reccomend it highly enough",5,2013,01,15
226,AMAZING AGAIN.. EVEN AFTER MY BOOKING ERROR,"Me and my fiancee stayed at the Fitzwilliam to celebrate our engagement after not having the chance to earlier in the year.

I made a booking error on a non refundable or transferable room and booked it for the wrong day which the member of staff on the desk( i really cannot remember her name we stayed sat 12th of jan 2013 and she had really short blonde hair i think she was the senior member on the desk at the time around 1400) could see this was a genuine mistake and she was amazing and helped us out by sorting us out with a room which in no what did she have to under the policy she could have charged us full price for the room amazing service and just hits home that the fitzwiliam is a top notch hotel at very very reasonable prices.

At breakfast again the service was amazing a man called Chris Nelson i believe his name was very very helpful and went out of his way to fulfil a request we had which was not on the menu again many hotels would not have done this and again a great reason why this hotel is amazing there is everything at breakfast and the food is top quality.

The hotel is always clean great atmosphere which the rooms being very spacious service is quite simply the best we have ever received in a hotel and we have stayed in quite a few around the world .

I will be back in the near future to stay again and enjoy all the fitzwilliam has to offer thanks to to them for an amazing stay.",5,2013,01,13
226,Good solid hotel,"I stayed a single night with work.

The hotel is clean, well fit out and with good facilities. The staff were very friendly and helpful.

Only very minor issue was that the television could be in a better position for watching from bed. Good quality wifi etc.

I ate in the restaurant and can strongly recommend the food. The duck was excellent as was the stewed fruit and ice cream.

Would highly recommend to stay again.",5,2013,01,12
226,Amazing luxury hotel,"I stayed at the Fitzwilliam whilst on business in Belfast.  The room was amazing, clean and comfortable big bed.  The breakfast was amazing, I'd never tried white pudding before!! I'd definitely stay here again",5,2013,01,11
226,Disappointed,"I stayed in this hotel with my husband on boxing day and unfortunately I was disappointed. The service was poor from the minute we arrived. The receptionist wasn't welcoming, the concierge was hanging through a car window chatting when we drove up, to what appeared to be a friend. We had booked for dinner and the service again was terrible. My husband didn't get the sauce for his steak, we had to ask for our plates to be taken away after they has sat for some time. The room was shabby in places,the net curtains had a few holes, the duvet cover had a large hole at the seam and the wooden furniture was marked from wear and tear at the edges. On checkout, again the receptionist was very dull and not polite, she never asked if we enjoyed our stay, or thanked us for staying or even wished us a good day! All in all a big disappointment.",2,2013,01,10
226,Really enjoyable,"My girlfriend and I spent last weekend there.  As I'm from Belfast I know the town well.  Really good reception, breakfast, bar and room service.  Room large, amazingly comfortable bed. Could have done with more towels and a couple of robes.  One Concierge a little slow, the other fantastic.  We have stayed in the most luxurious hotels around the world and were pleasantly surprised.  A very local welcome which takes you aback, but actually is endearing.  No hesitation in recommending",5,2013,01,08
226,Definitely not 5 star - no wonder they are almost making a profit,"Stayed in supposed 5 star hotel for theatre in Grand Opera House - Legally Blonde in April 2012 - so called pre theatre dinner  - understaffed and slow meant we had the pre theatre dinner - no time for pre theatre dessert as had to run out to catch start of show - if they want to make a profit then hire staff and train them to serve people - numerous attempts to buy a drink were rebuffe as staff didn't seem to be interested. My limited knowledge of hospitality industry says sell as much drink as possible - I have just about recovered from dehydration. Must be easier. 

As for hotel room - is minimalism the new 5 star?",2,2013,01,06
226,Great stay,This is our second stay here....they have been great. My husband had arranged some surprises for me and our son!!!! They have been great with all of our requests. The rooms are great. We are staying a king suite and have enjoyed it immensely and highly recommend this hotel. The bar was great.... They were very attentive and the food was great. We also had room service while ere and the quality and quantity of the food was great. We will def stay here again.,5,2013,01,06
226,Great hotel let down by service,The rooms are lovely and the location is great for staying in Belfast. The service in the restaurant was shocking at both dinner and breakfast. Dinner took a pedestrian three hours and we left before coffee. Breakfast was almost an hour and a half. Check in and out needs you to allow an extra half hour of your life. ,3,2013,01,05
226,"Friendly, fun and up with the best","We stayed here the week before Christmas as part of a trip to NI to see friends and family. We really enjoyed our stay. The room was exceptionally comfortable, beautifully designed and furnished, spacious and scrupulously clean. It was very contemporary in style (which we like) without being at all soulless. We loved hearing the clock-tower nearby striking the hour - it made us feel part of the city - but it may grate with some. The view from the window wasn't at all pretty - but we had opted for one of the cheaper rooms round the side; the front aspect would be much more attractive; still, it's a city centre hotel so what do you expect. 
The Hotel is superbly located; the City is tiny really, so everything worth seeing is easily strollable. 
What makes the hotel however is the staff; we say this about Belfast every time, but the staff here are just the best in the World. Friendly, kind, professional, and with a really wicked sense of humour that takes the edge out of any problem you might be having. The service here isn't 'slick'. Belfast isn't slick - but that's rather the point. Everything here gets done just fine, cheerfully and with soul. Maybe it'll be slower than it would be in London or Barcelona, but what of it? You'll have a conversation with a real human being and an interaction that feels like they truly care. The extra couple of minutes or lack of super-smooth slickness aren't missed. 
The two concierges (an older chap called Billy I believe) and a younger assistant were both absolutely superb. They managed to find us restaurant bookings on one of the busiest nights of the year - went the extra mile by phoning us on our mobiles to let us know our options - and seemed to have recommendations and ideas at their fingertips. We never felt we were being 'sold' a favourite recommendation (as you so often do), but rather that they really wanted us to have a good time. Really world class. Both are real characters and just great 'craic' to talk to about the city. 
The hotel bar is a good place to hang out late on - we ended up chatting to complete strangers late at night after the clubs closed!
Belfast isn't the prettiest city in the World and the shopping options are limited (although some really world class art galleries on the Lisburn Road and boutiques there too), but boy does this town know how to have a good time. Bars, clubs and restaurants to suit every taste and budget and a weekend crowd that seems to be able to have raucous fun on a weekend without unpleasantness. We adore our trips to Belfast ! 
I wouldn't however say that this hotel feels like it is on the same level as, say, The Merchant or the Culloden. But it's head and shoulders above other similarly priced options like The Europa or Radisson - 5 star is a broad band with a lot of variation; it feels 5* in terms of it's furnishings and helpful service, but maybe it's just a bit too modern or new to really have that 'special' feel. 
So overall, if you're in town for a fun weekend, want something relaxed, friendly and unpretentious with a contemporary feel - you couldn't do better. For a honeymoon or a really special occasion I'd take the more characterful options. We loved the Fitzwilliam and really rate it's value for money and location.",4,2013,01,02
226,Never again!,"What can I say about my week at the Fitzwilliam!  Just don't know where to start with the catalogue of errors.  But a positive point, the front of house team were extremely helpful on arrival and this is last positive we can say about the Fitzwilliam Hotel.   

On arrival (23 December) we requested a table at 8pm for dinner on the 24th only to be told that the kitchen closes at 8pm and our reservation would have to be 7pm.  Not a problem.  Will get back to this shortly.

On leaving the reception to go our suite on the 8th floor we were shocked at the shabbiness of the lift.  Stains on the carpet and the handrail looked as if a scrapper had been taken to it.

The suite!   We have stayed in better designed double rooms.  Dark, dank and the smokey black curtains did not help.   Settee pushed up against the bed, open plan throughout, no privacy in the bathroom, toilet had a sliding frosted door which rattled every time it was moved. Broken glass on the tea tray in the room, the facecloth had quite a few holes in it and worst of all was the dried blood on one of the bathrobes (which were so old and hard they should have been thrown out a long time ago).  Stains on the settee, headphone socket not working on the TV, towel rail in the toilet - not in the shower room. Ironing board broken. All this points shown to Katie, Duty Manager.

Back to dinner on the 24th.  Ordered wine which we were told had to be sent up from the bar.  We had finished our starter and the main course had arrived before the wine was served.  Was a little surprised that our bottle of wine was put into another customer's wine cooler which was placed out of our reach.   Food left a lot to be desired.  Sauced poured over the steak when it should have been served separately.  Remember we were told to be there for 7pm?  They still had customers arriving at 9pm.  When we queried this we were informed there was a mix up with the bookings of three different parties!

On Christmas Eve, while waiting for friends, we had drinks served to us in the lobby.  Approximately 10mins after the drinks arrived we were asked to vacate the table as they wanted to reserve it for people, who were not residents, but had booked afternoon tea.  This has happened to another couple sitting at the table next to us.  Needless to say they were informed that we would not be moving.  

Sitting in the bar one evening we were asked to settle the account for our drinks as they were removing the till (this was at 10pm). As residents we were told that we could have more drinks which would be charged to our room, but we would have to sit in the lobby.

Then when the bill arrived we were being charged 3 nights car parking - strange as our car was parked at Heathrow and we did not hire one whilst in Belfast.  When this was queried, the hotel informed us that another guest had the same name as us and an error had been made.  Understatement of 2012, the error was actually on our part - we booked into a 2nd rate hotel, believing the hype of it being a top hotel. Have always stayed at the Europa, and cannot wait to return as I will never book into the Fitzwilliam again.",2,2013,01,02
226,Awful......,"We went to this hotel for a New Years meal with a group of friends (10). First impressions were pretty good when arriving at the hotel the lobby was lovely with the open fire and there seemed to be a good buzz about the hotel. 

We were shown to a big table which was lovely and the waitress took are drinks order, they didnt really offer to take a drinks order and when the beer drinkers wanted a paticular beer which was only available from the downstairs bar they didnt seem keen on going downstairs to get it. 

A few of us ordered steaks and asked for them to be cooked medium rare but whenever they came to the table they were practically rare.

When we asked for the bill it also appeared that we were charged for an extra bottle of wine which we didnt have but we got that sorted out.

We decided to go down the bar after the meal for drinks,the bar is lovely with all of the dark decor. We got a table quite easy and had a look at the extensive cocktail menu. A bar man came along who i assume is the bar manager and took our order which was a bottle of wine and two cocktails. One of my friends said to him 'sorry im having a hard time choosing a cocktail' and the bar man rudely said 'well I cant keep coming back all night so you'll need to decide now what you want now'. 

The drinks were delivered to table along with the bill and again we were over charged and had to go back to the bar get it corrected.

After our drinks we decided that we were going somewhere else because we weren't going to be spoken to in a rudely.

I wont be back!",3,2013,01,01
226,Fantastic hotel let down by service,"Nothing to fault on the actual hotel itself, quite the opposite - excellent location, contemporary and stylish decor, very comfortable room, all very 5*, perfect!

The service however was not up to scratch.  Note that this is not in any way due a lack of friendliness or effort on the part of the staff.  It just wasn't a slick 5* operation, much more like an average provincial hotel.  The longest check in I have EVER had in any hotel, receptionists answering calls while in the middle of serving you, being told the cocktails were off in the bar (why!??).  Nothing some strong management couldn't sort out, and not enough to prevent me returning.",4,2013,01,01
226,Usual high standard,"We regularly stay at the Fitzwilliam each December as a family. It is one of our favourite hotels for a stopover in Belfast. This stay was similar to most others, the check-in was smooth and efficient, our special requests had been met but what stood out was the vast improvement in service at breakfast.  If you are a light sleeper, try for a room on one of the higher floors as the restaurant is noisy, with chairs being scraped along the floors, etc.",4,2012,12,31
226,Superb Afternoon Tea,"We arrived at the hotel and we were immediately impressed with the large, open and contemporary lobby area.  A couple of people were waiting at reception, so we stood behind, however the Concierge came straight over and asked if he could help!  We were immediately shown to our reserved area by the beautiful modern fire.  The waiter was very courteous and could not have been more helpful.  We were served unlimited amounts of tea as we enjoyed a large selection of dainty sandwiches, quiches, macaroons, pastries, scones, cream, etc.!   One of my friends had asked for sandwiches without butter at the time of booking, however they came with butter, but when she asked about this, we were brought out another plate of delicious sandwiches.   The chicken, mixed leaves and dressing sandwiches and scones are delicious!!   What a beautiful way to spend an afternoon with friends!!  Would highly recommend!",5,2012,12,30
226,Average,"First of all can I just say that the staff were great. Very helpful and a pleasure to deal with. The only thing that got me is that parts of the hotel seem run down or maybe worn down would be better to use. Dirty carpets throughout the hotel and dirty booklets with stains on them in the room that I was afraid to touch. I did not expect these things in a five star hotel, i have never stayed in one before and I just expected better standards all round. Maybe I am be being fussy, but all other things I cannot fault, especially the staff.",3,2012,12,30
226,Great location,"Great hotel and good central location. Worth ¬£100/room/night, but not much more! Car parking is ¬£17/ night at the hotel, so can be expenses if you are staying a few days. There is cheaper multi story car parking nearby.",4,2012,12,30
226,"Inefficient, poorly trained and insufficient quantity of staff, and a fundamentally broken operation.","The entire experience from parking signage, street valet, check in, committed room availability, room cleanliness, quality of food, service staff knowledge, and amenities are two and a half star quality at best.   

As a private equity investor who spends 80+% time on the road in five star hotels around the world, I've seen the most accomplished of hotelier operations in The Ritz Carlton, The Four Seasons, and even The Park Hyatt.   I've also see hundreds of failed as failing businesses in need of capital, strategy, and/or improved management. This hotel has a great history and even greater potential, but, regretfully, utterly fails in execution.  

At this hotel, you will have to wait and when a time is committed be it will be missed. This is consistent from the amount of time the valet (who is also the concierge and the bellman) requires to get back to the concierge desk in order to take your keys after you self park your car on the street to the room that should be ready in 20 minutes still unavailable after 90 minutes of waiting after check-in. 

Overall, the staff is young and seem to genuinely want to do a good job, but have not been properly trained on the contents of the food and drink menu or general best-in-class service protocol. You will wait too long for service in the restaurant only to find a server who needs to ask her manager everything (including how to handle the coffee machine being broken during breakfast).  In The Bar, I had a waiter insist that the Bailey's and Coffee was indeed the Negroni that I ordered. Only after my insistence he check with the bartender did he return conceding he delivered the wrong drink (a hot coffee and cream in mug versus iced bitters in a rocks glass).

The hotel room was sufficient, but there were only two pillows on the bed, no duvet, and the non-slip film on the shower was coming off in huge strips (even after two days of cleaning where the room attendants failed to call engineering to remedy it).

Hopefully there will be a management, cultural, and general resource paradigm change before the plight of its current management approach drives The Fitzwilliam into the mediocrity of a prior greatness squandered into present-day obscurity. ",2,2012,12,29
226,Very good Belfast City Centre Hotel.,"Stayed for one night, Friday into Saturday to visit a club in Belfast. Check-in was smooth and staff were friendly, although our room wasn't ready even at 2pm! went off for a coffee and our bag was delivered to our room. Our very nice room! was a good size, very clean and perfectly adaquate for our stay. Ensuite bathroom was a good size with a large walk-in shower and bath. Bed was large and very comfortable. Plenty of space for clothes in the double wardrobe.
We found all the hotel staff friendly even when we returned to the hotel bar at 1.30am and had a pot of tea and large glass of iced water before bed.
Breakfast was a bit slow and my cooked breakfast was a little overdone, but the hotel was very busy this weekend and the staff done their very best under the circumstances.
I would have no hesitation recommending the Fitzwilliam Hotel if you are visiting Belfast City Centre.",4,2012,12,29
226,fabulous hotel,stayed here earlier in the year for an overnight work trip....... the hotel was beautiful - room was fantastic - just disappointed I wasn't staying a bit longer to be able to enjoy it more ....... the breakfast was fantastic too! lots to choose from! hotel is very central - fantastic spot for shopping and maybe even some cocktails too - will definitely return sometime :-),4,2012,12,28
226,Very nice hotel,"have stayed here twice now and both times were very good. rooms are small but beds are big and comfy. the food in the bar is excellent and very well priced. location is excellent, staff are very friendly, overall a really nice modern hotel.",5,2012,12,26
226,A great location in Belfast with inner calm,"I stay here regularly for business and as a regular traveller I still look forward to coming back. A great city hotel with well trained, friendly efficient staff. Good well appointed rooms and comfortable beds, food always consistently good classics. I don't drive here but parking may be a little difficult check with the hotel.",5,2012,12,23
226,"Nice room, food nice, DRINKS expensive","Thought for a wee treat would bring the mrs out to this hotel to stay for a night. We arrived easy enough, parking is bit*h to be honest but there is a spot across the street. Rooms were nice enough, bed was comfy. The heat was on that night and it was really warm but with the window open it wasn't to bad. The food is amazing. I ordered a steak and was very impressed. 3 course offer with the room. The only thing is the drink is expensive. Couldnt believe the bill when the mrs had three or four cocktails. 
Over all nice spot, good food and location is handy enough. 
Enjoy
Thanks for reading :))",4,2012,12,17
226,Excellent hotel,"A very fresh hotel with very comfortable, spacious and colourful bedrooms. The breakfast was of exceptional standard and service flawless. The only downside to our trip was the hotel never came back to us on the valet parking, the reception staff didn't provide us with simple details like what time and where breakfast is served, etc... Will stay here again, probably.",4,2012,12,16
226,Good base for concert goers,"We stayed in the Fitzwilliam hotel, Belfast for one night. It is only 5 minutes by taxi from Central station. The staff at reception were very friendly and welcoming. The room was very comfortable and spotlessly clean. Unfortunately the service in the bar was lacking, and they were unable to serve my drink with my meal, even though there was at least 4 people behind the bar. The concierge gave a poor service also when trying to organise people transport to the Odyssey arena. Also, there was no buffet breakfast, which is unusual. These things would not put me off staying there again, but this hotel needs to learn to give sharper service.",4,2012,12,15
226,Not what id call 5*!,"Cannot praise the helpful staff enough, the reception staff were pleasant, lovely to chat to and the Concierge that were on duty where more than helpful booking taxis and storing luggage when we hit the shops. Even the domestic staff were polite when passing them. Just these few bits had me wondering how they got their stars. Our room was basic, black furniture with quite a few chips in them, a paint touch up on the ceiling just covered the area needed, which looked very cheap. Pulling the curtains over at nite, which was required because we were looking directly into another bedroom, we noticed loads of food or possibly worse stains. we didn't get, or couldn't find our complimentary bottled water. and even a two star can provide you with a biscuit or two to have with your coffee, none were found. The hair dryer was useless, took 4 times as long to dry my short hair. And finally you can avail of slippers and a bathrobe but they don't automatically put them in your room, you have to phone down to reception and they supposed to send them up. Finally the fire alarm sounded briefly at around 3am and woke us up! yet next morning no one knew anything about it? Finally its near Christmas, apart from a small tree in the foyer and a gold reindeer on the book shelves, it really very sparse. Not recommending you put glitter on anything that stands still for long enough, but it seriously looked like no effort was put into it at all. Mite be tempted to stay again, only because of its location and staff but not impressed with the above!",3,2012,12,12
226,Great hotel great location,This hotel is fabulous.  Staff are absolutely lovely and helpful.  We stayed in an Executive Room and it was very modern spacious and comfortable.   The location is spot on right next door to the Opera House and almost opposite Crown Bar and Robinsons.  Hotel lobby is lovely with sofas chairs and cosy fireplace.  It really is a great place and we will be back as soon as we can.,5,2012,12,12
226,Good Experience,This hotel is very nice and has a great location near city centre. The room and bathroom were very nice - clean and spacious.  The bar is a bit small but we didn't spend much time there as there are lots of other bars on same street.  Breakfast was very good.  All staff were really good and helpful.  If you are on a budget you might sort out your own parking because the hotel rate is a bit expensive.  You may also skip breakfast as there are loads of places near at hand much cheaper.,4,2012,12,10
226,Not impressed,"I booked 5 Standard Rooms for 1 night and discovered that we were all in fully accessible rooms with no bath and a very low sink. When I enquired the next morning at check-out I was told that all standard rooms were fully accessible and I should have booked Executive Rooms! I said it wasn't clear on the web-site when I booked and my 4 English colleagues weren't impressed. They said sorry about that! That aside, staff were efficient. Valet parking was good. Drinks are expensive. Room was clean.",3,2012,12,10
226,AVERAGE,"when we arrived the receptionist did not greet us until she had stopped fiddling with something
needs work on her people skills
we stayed for 1 night in an executive room the room had garish decor tired furniture with chipped paint 
very average 
this stay was more expensive than the merchant !!!",3,2012,12,10
226,Cannot fault my experience...,"I visit many hotels across the country for pleasure but mainly work. We stayed in the Fitzwilliam for one night over the weekend whilst visiting both the city and some friends. The staff were excellent from start to finish, they were happy to recommend local restaurants and organise transport for us. The room was excellent. Very clean, great facilities, comfy and large bed and a beautiful bathroom. Perhaps most importantly to myself, the rooms were very quiet indeed despite its city centre location (when I say very quiet, I mean I couldn't even hear the traffic). The hotel is also in a great location. Just a few minutes walk into the city centre, near numerous restaurants and bars. I cannot really fault my stay at this hotel!",5,2012,12,09
226,@KERRY C,I have been staying at this hotel since it opened and have to say your last review is obviously an attempt at recovering some dignity from a drunken night out. Over the years I have got to know the security staff quite well and the are nothing but accommodating every time. I dont believe that this would happen and you should redirect your anger elsewhere. The staff at the Fitzwilliam are always courteous and helpful every time.,5,2012,12,06
226,Excellent Stay @ Fitzwilliam Belfast,"We stayed here fri 30th November as we were attending a wedding in another hotel which was fully booked! We prebooked the parking which is highly recommended and had our car parked for us and brought round again on checkout - Lovely touch! Our room was fantastic with 2 of our walls replaced with floor to ceiling windows looking out onto a busy junction - We could have sat there all night just looking out the window :) Excellent room with mirrors everywhere. The bathroom was superb with a bath and shower! The decor of the room was very modern and jazzy! All the facilities you needed from toiletries, tissues, tea and coffee, hifi and tv! Our only regret is that we did not get enough time to spend in our room or the hotel as i said earlier we were at a wedding! We had a snack in the bar which was lovely and the bar staff were very accommodating! We will defo return to the Fitzwilliam and would highly recommend it to anyone. Also shopping is just 5 mins away so would be a great base for it and nightlife!",5,2012,12,03
226,Thoroughly Enjoyed,"We stayed in this hotel in October.  It really exceeded our expectations.  The room was tastefully decorated. It was a good size and the bathroom was a delight. The bath and shower were large enough for a romantic dip/shower together. The bed was large and comfortable. The hotel offered free wifi which was fab.  The staff were exceptionally friendly and efficient. We enjoyed a lovely meal in the hotel, and I felt at a reasonable price. Drinks weren't too expensive either.  Location was perfect;- 2 minutes walk from the bus station, short walk to the shops and across the street from good pubs.  We found Belfast to be a beautiful city, with lots to do.  The people were some of the friendliest we have ever encountered.",5,2012,12,01
226,Very good,"Nicely designed, high-quality rooms, stylish hotel overall, good breakfast and really nice staff.

Reception is a nice comfy place to wait or meet, with lots of space and a gorgeous fire.

Some traffic noise in the rooms at the front.",5,2012,11,28
226,Glamorous,"Gorgeous reception area, with a fire at its heart. Very welcoming on a cold November night. The bar does a very good dry martini and the breakfast is to a very high standard as well. My bed was the biggest I have ever seen, it was enormous. Very comfortable, well situated and welcoming hotel. I would recommend.",4,2012,11,26
226,chic colours,I reserved a king size single room with breakfast for seven days. Service was excellent. Place is smaller than expected as I was looking for a spacious five-star hotel. However the hallway and rooms are very chic with mirror doors and beautiful curtains and sofa chairs.,4,2012,11,25
226,Business Trips,"I have used the Fitzwilliam Hotel for business meetings and accommodation on various ocassions and have settled on this hotel as the one to use for all our company accommodation in the last year. Excellent staff , improved breakfast service of late, rooms and location very good. Things work and presented well.Would highly recommend for business meetings.",5,2012,11,21
226,Nice rooms,"Spent the night in the Fitzwilliam recently. The rooms are beautiful  and the staff are very friendly. Parking is a issue, on the surface its expensive but you might find the hotel parking to be the better value. The bar was very good on Saturday evening.",4,2012,11,20
226,Good 4 star not 5 star,"My other half booked a suite,  very sweet of him but have to say and I've said it before what the Fitzwilliam call a suite, is not, open plan bathrooms just don't work for anyone unless you're on your own.  Toilet with glass (all be it frosted) door not good.  Any suite I have stayed in has a separate seating area, which I would have appreciated much more than the open plan bathroom.  Its in essence a large room not a suite.  We were in Suite 809 so if your tempted to book a suite, I would say don't the rooms are very good and the bathrooms are better.",4,2012,11,20
226,great spot,Stayed in this lovely hotel a few months ago. Its very comfortable stylish hotel. Staff very professional. A lovely touch to have valet parking when you arrive and leave. Hotel easy to locate on way into Belfast from Dublin. The only thing I would add to this hotel is a spa.,4,2012,11,19
226,Convenient located hotel for shopping and nitelife alike,"Boutique hotel with up to date furnishings/low lighting. Very slick interiors with modern twists. Service orientated with good staff. We stayed here for our fifth wedding anniversary. It was a good hotel and upon arrival we received two glasses of champagne to mark the occasion. It was very definitely couple orientated, not sure if this was intentional. Very close to all amenities, definitely recommend for a good quality city break in Belfast.",4,2012,11,19
226,Returning year after year!!,We have stayed in the fitzwilliam hotel 3/4 years running for our anniversary. We look so much forward to stayin as your treated so well from you enter until you leave. We've had dinner and breakfast and it's been Devine can't wait to return! Rooms are decorated to a very high standard they are clean and luxurious.,5,2012,11,17
226,Watch your bill,"Comfortable, well located, large room WiFi in room.  Low lighting in room therefore difficult to see. They intended to lift ¬£109 from our credit card more for 3 nights than the rate we had booked for on booking.com. No explanation. Happened to friends we were with as well obviously a try on. 

Very good coffee shop and diner called 'the Streat' nearby in Wellington Place where you can get an excellent breakfast at a fraction of the hotel price.",4,2012,11,15
226,Fantastic,"I have stayed in this city centre a number of times and is my favourite Belfast city centre hotel. beautiful rooms and staff customer care is genuine and professional. Absolutely love the foyer, warm atmosphere, but yet peaceful hotel for a city centre.  You certainly feel looked after in this hotel.",5,2012,11,15
226,Great place to stay in Belfast,"In walking distance of all of the city's main attractions, the Fitzwilliam has well-appointed rooms, exceptionally friendly and helpful staff and a wonderful restaurant and bar.  In fact, the hotel can not be faulted and it is of a standard that many other hotels in the UK can only dream of attaining.  Absolutely fantastic.",5,2012,11,13
226,Stay again a must,"Stayed here last December whilst visiting family, we had a deluxe room with a cot for our 2 yr old, room was immaculate spacious and large, breakfast was good the next morning too, an ideal good quality hotel to explore Belfast city centre, which is within 3 mins walk.",4,2012,11,12
226,funky modern hotel,i can not fault the stay we had in the fitzwilliam hotel.from arrival to departure the staff were very helpful and friendly.the rooms were just modern and the bed was comfortable.the bathroom was fab.we had a meal and althought im a very picky eater i found the food lovely..would definately recommend staying here,5,2012,11,12
226,Great Trendy Hotel with terrific service,"Pleasantly surprised, first time to Belfast and the Hotel was a great start. We had an all inclusive 4  course dinner, breakfast and champagne/chocolates in the room ... what can I say the food was great the service friendly. I was think when sitting down to dinner .. ok this is where I now see all the extras being charged .. but no .. amazing. 

So for two people in a Executive room (very large with real;y nice large bath and double shower) four course dinner for two, breakfast of your choice .. even a la carte, proper Champagne and Artisan Chocolates ‚Ç¨230.00 the only extras we had was ‚Ç¨17:00 for valet parking and the wine with dinner .....

Checkout the specials for this hotel ... a real deal 

My only complaint was to ask for a second set of pillows .. even they got to the room in under 5 minutes.",5,2012,11,12
226,exceptionally pleasant and comfortable hotel with really friendly staff,Spent 2 nights here on our visit to Belfast. Rooms are very large and beautifully appointed with a stunning bathroom. Little touches like the candle and matches beside the bath.  Feels more like a 5 star hotel than a 4 star . I would recommend a room at the back as it was quiet with no city centre traffic noise . Superb breakfast . The hotel is very modern and chic . Staff particularly helpful and friendly. Would definitely recommend this hotel and hope to return there!,5,2012,11,10
226,"Sophisticated, Modern, Comfortable","Within the center of the city is The Fitz William Hotel, perfectly located for walking the city and visiting local shops and pubs.  The staff proved to be very attentive, personable and helpful.  Our group stayed two evenings at the hotel, enjoying a wonderful dinner together.  The restaurant presented perfectly executed culinary dishes that were so delicious from starters to desserts. 
The rooms were beautifully decorated, wifi throughout the hotel and very comfy beds.  This hotel will certainly be on the top of my list for the next Belfast visit.",5,2012,11,09
226,Great as usual,"This is my 3rd stay there, it was great ... nothing more than that is needed, a great large room with a comfortable bed, free wifi, very nice bathroom, coffee maker available in room and reasonable prices  .... Highly recommended",5,2012,11,09
226,Chic hotel in a perfect location,"This hotel is really chic. Its the boutique style with lots of high roofs and spacious room. The couch in the room was excellcent. The bar is small but the food is great and good value. The staff, especially on reception, were pleasant and efficent. The only down side (which seems to an issue with all Belfast city centre hotels) was the car parking fees. ¬£17 per night-very steep in my opinion. We parked across the road in the McCausland car park which was literally 50 meters away. They give a discount if you are staying at the hotel which ranges from ¬£1 on friday to a ¬£6 reduction on Sunday? A worthwhile option.
Back to the hotel though, its a reall nice hotel in a perfect location yards from shopping/pubs and sites. Go enjoy the luxury and the class.",5,2012,11,07
226,Nice hotel with friendly and helpful staff,"My friend and I came up for a few days in Belfast, after being in Dublin for 4 days.  The hotel is centrally located, and the staff is very nice and helpful.  I would reccomend making a reservation for a taxi tour of the murals throught the concierge - we got a private driver, who was very professional and knowledgeable.  The Hotel is definately trying to be chic.   I am from Manhattan, so I may be a little bit jaded on that point, as I felt it almost, but not quite, hit the mark. But putting that aside, it is a very nice hotel, and is very centrally located.  Just a quick tip - I had booked a hotel room on the website that had an ""open shower"", as it was the least expensive.  I didn't realize that this was code for ""handicapped accessable"".  While I applaud the hotel for having what appears to be outstanding facilities for those with physical limitations, I would have selected another room had I known, as 1) I think the room should be saved for those that need the special access, and 2) the layout of the room, designed for someone in a wheelchair, is awkward for someone who is not.  The low, small sink, and shower without walls that is actually part of the bathroom (I was thinking of something else when I read open shower), were less then optimal, and I would have selected another room. But overall, very nice hotel, and I would stay there again.",4,2012,11,07
226,The Best Hotel Ever!,Me & my partner booked an overbite nite stay at the Fitzwilliam Hotel as a treat. We checked in around lunchtime on Sun. The experience was amazing from start to finish. The staff all throughout we're first class & profesional. The food & drink was of a high standard also. We booked a deluxe room which was one of the best we have ever stayed in & the view from the large windows was breathtaking as we were quite high up. Awsome Hotel.,5,2012,11,06
226,very chic,"Stayed for a birthday & loved it, very plush.
Lovely hotel, had a gorgeous dinner, cocktails were outstanding & the bar was so stylish.
Room looked over Belfast & the location is EXCELLENT!! 
Went downstairs for water at 1am...bar closed & they said they would bring it up ..¬£20 later! Car park is ¬£20 a night but very handy, staff park it in a private car park & deliver it back whenever you are checking out.
Dinner, breakfast, service, rooms, cleanliness were all outstanding.
Sleep quality was brilliant considering its in the middle of belfast, beds were to die for and it was very quiet. WISH THIS HOTEL HAD A SPA!!!!!
Quite expensive but worth the money!",5,2012,11,06
226,Perfect location,"This was our first visit to Belfast. We caught the bus from the airport and arrived at the bus station just a few minutes walk from the hotel. The Fitzwilliam is perfectly located for shops, restaurants and bars. 
The hotel staff were very welcoming, efficient and friendly. Our room was clean with a large bed, settee and tea/coffee making facilities. The bathroom had a bath and walk in shower with plenty of freebies.
This was luxury at its best.",5,2012,11,05
226,Fabulous hotel with lovely staff,"Stayed at The Fitzwilliam for two nights in October 2012. The hotel is 5*, the rooms are 5* and the staff are 5*. What else is there to say! Except ......(in an Arnold Schwarzenegger stylee) I'LL BE BACK ;-)",5,2012,11,05
226,Chic hotel in the heart of the city,"Just returned from a one night stay at the Fitzwilliam. Check-in was friendly and efficient. Superior room was spacious and spotless. We didn't avail of food in the hotel so can't comment. After our Opera House show we had a couple of drinks in the cosy ground floor bar. Nice relaxed ambience and extensive cocktail menu here too. And to top it all, so convenient to all that Belfast has to offer.",4,2012,11,05
226,Wonderful Weekend,"Stayed last month for 2 nights.  Frequent visitors to Belfast for shopping and relaxation.  Having seen the hotel rooms on the website we decided to treat ourselves to the weekend in the Fitzwilliam.  What a delight.  Excellent location, fab trendy decor. However the jewel in the crown of this hotel is the breakfast.  The best breakfast we've had in a long time.  Unlike most of the 5 star hotels in Ireland, in the Fitzwilliam your cooked breakfast is made to order and served fresh to your table.  This coupled with a massive buffet spread, great coffee and the morning papers make for a fantastic treat.  The level of professionalism of the staff in the restaurant was a hit with us.  We were seated and looked after by a friendly, energetic girl called Lauren.  Our every need was looked after by her. Some of her colleagues could do with following her lead a little more.

On our evenings we enjoyed fab cocktails served by the charming Jonathon, who was both friendly and on the button with the drinks!

All in all a great stay and we will be back!",5,2012,11,04
226,First class,"I stayed here one night on business - not enough! I was fortunate enough to have a suite on the 8th floor which was absolutely stunning. Very comfortable with music playing in the room as you entered and a decent sized table to work at - and free wifi too. 

Service throughout the hotel was of a very high quality - from reception to concierge to events staff, and the meeting room facilities on the 9th floor were excellent, with views over the city.

The food whilst perfectly good was not exceptional. I had breakfast at the hotel, and we also had a buffet style lunch as part of our room hire - however for this the sandwiches and chips were all rather plain and there was a little bit of confusion as to whether we were also having soup.

It did take a while getting around the hotel - the lifts can be slow - and the fitness suite was rather small - but overall the Fitzwilliam hotel really made my stay in Belfast feel special.

This is the third hotel I've stayed at in Belfast, and all have been very good. Would recommend.",5,2012,11,03
226,First Class Hotel,"Just returned from a 1-night stay in the wonderful Fitzwilliam Hotel.

Great location, huge bedroom and bathroom (shower is particularly large), with excellent staff.

From the warm greeting on arrival to the welcoming fire, it was an excellent 1-night stay.

We will be back!",5,2012,11,03
226,AMAZING STAY,"This is a wonderful hotel. I was delighted with the experience. I stayed here for  a weekend with a friend and we would go there again. The stay were very friendly and helpful. The concierge were amazing. They helped with tours of the city, recommendations and even sorted out our boarding cards for the flight home. 

The room was amazing. The bed was huge and very comfortable. They had thought of everything. The bath even had a candle and matches. It was also nice to have a mini hifi in the room too. CDs could be borrowed from the concierge. 

The breakfast was very tasty too. A great selection of different things. A bit disappointed to be told they'd run out of salmon for one of the freshly cooked breakfast options (especially as 5 minutes later the table next to us had salmon) but I can live with that as the Irish breakfast was just as tasty. 

The location of the hotel was great. Very close to the bus station and walking into town is very quick. 

I loved the stay in this hotel. They made my trip to Belfast unforgettable.",5,2012,11,02
226,A Wonderful stay at a great hotel,"Had a wonderful two day trip here last weekend..service, value and room was excellent. The Breakfast was delicious although there was a real break down of service on the second morning...probably just one of those things. When I mentioned it at front desk, they promised to be in touch but haven't as yet. Apart from that, a great experience!",5,2012,10,31
226,Good hotel. Helpful staff.,"A cut above other Hilton-class hotels.  Staff very friendly and helpful. Free wifi makes this a businessman's hotel. 

Avoid the restaurant though. Overpriced and food disappointing. 

Location is handy for the assembley buildings. ¬£10 taxi from Belfast City airport so good location for business from London. ",4,2012,10,29
226,Great stay in Belfast,"We recently stayed in Fitzwilliam for our visit to Belfast, and had a great experience. The staff were so friendly - they really did their best to answer our questions, and adapt every part of our stay to our preferences. The rooms were comfortable and we did not feel 'too dark' as some other visitors had felt. It has a great central location, and we happened to dine out for dinner, but would certainly visit the restaurant for dinner as part of our next visit. The breakfast was good (and again, dishes could be adjusted to preference) and nothing was in short supply. The concierges were also helpful - there was never a delay to getting the car from the parking lot, and got really good information about local tours and sightseeing.",5,2012,10,27
226,Cocktail making masterclass,"I am a little delayed as we took part in this in May 2012. A group of 10 girls booked on a cocktail masterclass at the hotel with a 3-course meal to follow.
The hotel staff were excellent, greeting us in reception and showing us to the bar until we all arrived. Our class was on the top floor of the hotel with great views. Our cocktail class was fantastic and light hearted with our very knowledgable and experienced host. We all have the chance to mix cocktails in groups and learn facts about where they were from. Canapes were served whilst we tasted them - with prizes for the winner.
Our three course meal in the restaurant was also excellent with choices that met with everyones needs including our gluten free guest.
All in all, a fabulous evening for my hen weekend in Belfast. Such a friendly city.",5,2012,10,26
226,"Great decor, but still some issues to sort out with smooth service...","My husband and I stayed for two nights. The previous 3 nights we'd stayed at the Fitzwilliam in Dublin. Both are well positioned, beautifully decorated hotels. The standard room we had in Belfast was larger than the standard in Dublin. Our only issue with the room is the latex mattress which gets too hot with the think duvet. We wish hotels would add a top sheet so you have the option of being covered but not cooked. This set up is the norm in Europe and a constant complaint for us.
However, the main problem with the Belfast Fitzwilliam is the patchy service. An experienced manager is needed to help iron out inefficiencies. We sat in the lobby for afternoon tea on a Friday. It wasn't busy in the lobby at about 5pm, but it took 3 requests to two different staff to have someone take our order. Eventually a girl at reception took our order and related it to the bar. It then took another 20 minutes and another enquiry for our tea and coffee to come. However, they had to Ceylon tea for the 96 year old lady who was with us, so she selected another tea. She also asked for a sultana Danish and was happy to wait the 10 minutes it would take to cook it freshly. However, it took another half an hour and two more complaints to receive it. Very embarrassing for us that we all had our drinks except our elderly friend. It was an absurd time to wait. If staff aren't available to serve properly, then afternoon tea should simply not be offered.
Whereas service was almost non existent in the lobby, the opposite was the case for dinner in the hotel restaurant. The food was fine - meat very well cooked, but 3 different waiters came up to ask if everything was okay with our meal, one after the other. Silly. The staff are young and inexperienced and need a better manager so only one waiter deals with each table. The attitude of the staff is great, very helpful, but the overall organisation of then needs to be smoother.
We booked a wake up call for 7am. The phone rang at 8am!  Lots of little errors like this just make you uneasy about trusting that basic services will be carried out. There was too much scribbled note taking by young staff that left too much error for miscommunication or simply forgetting - when a computer system where the details could be entered straight away would be better.
At breakfast, tongs were forgotten for slices of fruit, so I had to use my fingers to separate my pineapple from other slices. No water jug was out on the second morning near the juices. I ordered a pot of plain boiled water and another of green tea. Both were tainted with the taste of coffee from pots that hasn't been properly cleaned.
Altogether these things wouldn't put us off staying here again. Even though there were a lot of stuff ups, the staff were lovely and I only write in such detail to help the hotel know where it needs to improve to be first class.",4,2012,10,20
226,"Great location, friendly staff, value for money in central Belfast...","We had a mid-week stay here and found the hotel very clean, bright and welcoming. The staff, without exception were extremely pleasant and helpful, particularly the bar staff who knew their cocktails!! The only negative thing I would say is that our bathroom, designed to be accessible for all users, lacked any surface areas to put make-up/wash bags etc on and the sink in particular was very low down which meant I was almost kneeling to do my teeth. The shower also was not much more than a trickle, and despite that the water backed up and took maybe 10 minutes or so post-shower to clear. 
Cooked breakfast was tasty, but portions were a little on the skimpy side - ours was included in the room price, I definitely wouldn't have forked out an extra ¬£16.50 for it. Also service at breakfast, whilst polite, was quite slow.
All in all, just a few minor gripes and I would be happy to stay here again as the location is great and the price is very competitive for a city hotel.",4,2012,10,17
226,City Centre Gem,"Gerard the concierge and all the other Gerard's who covered the various shifts throughout our stay were magnificent. Happy to mind bags, before and after check-in / check-out. Organised a hire car without any fuss. Valet parked said hire car - gave us brillaint tips about where to go, what to see, where to have good food (the Harlem Cafe) - 5 star customer service.
The Hotel is very modern, with terrifically comfortable rooms. Breakfast's superb..........restaurant looked excellent, though did not try, should have done really! 
Highly reccommend - not the cheapest hotel we could have booked in this bracket - but I doubt we would have found another Gerard, at say the Europa.....and certainly not at the Holiday Inn !!",4,2012,10,16
226,Nice clean modern hotel in a great location,"We stayed on a Tuesday night after watching a show and thought the hotel was very good value for a nice, bright, comfortable room. There were just a couple of things that stop me giving it 5 stars. The bathroom was disappointing (shower not powerful, sink small and very low down and no storage) and I wasn't that impressed with breakfast. Staff were all helpful and the bar staff really knew their cocktails. I would definitely stay again.",4,2012,10,16
226,Brilliant,Had a lovely stay at the hotel. staff very friendly and helpful. food was gorgeous. I just didn't know about fridge in the room was not cold didn't know how to work it but it didn't mater. definitely stay again in the place. ,5,2012,10,13
226,Great Hotel Great Location,"We stayed here for 2 nights at the end of Sept. The check in was very quick due to the effeciency of the Staff. The room was spacious and very clean. I loved the idea of having a sofa to sit on instead of the bed. Although we were in the city centre, it was very quiet. The black out curtains and the comfy bed also helped with getting a good night sleep, Shopping is very exhausting!!. The only problem which was minor was the lack of TV stations available. We only got about 8 Channels.",5,2012,10,12
226,perfect city centre hotel,"My sister & I stayed here for my birthday in September. The staff were great, all friendly and eager to help. The room was clean, the bed was huge and really comfortable so we had a great sleep. The bathroom was fantastic with a massive shower on one side and a huge bath on the other & looked very funky with the wee black ties. The views from our room were great & even better from the function area on the top floor. We had dinner in the restaurant on the Saturday night and the meal was absolutely delicious. The staff even helped us choose where to go out for drinks afterwards. We booked through the top secret offer on another site and couldn't be happier with the hotel we ended up in. Great hotel, fantastic staff - highly recommended!",4,2012,10,12
226,So So,"Having recently stayed at this hotel with another couple for a leisurely night we were very impressed.  The reception and bar staff were lovely and accomodating and friendly.  The place although dark in places was lovely and clean.  Our bedroom was great lovely big bed and had a good nights sleep.   Then unfortunately it went downhill in the morning.  Got up for breakfast, got seated and went for our cereals etc.  We waited ages and eventually I called a young girl over to take our order, she commented that she had 3 things in her head at one time!!  At the table there were no teaspoons, sugar nor milk, we actually took them from another table as there was no one about to ask.  Then came the breakfast, very unimpressed.  It was such a small fry not great trying to feed 2 hungry men and women.  One sausage and 1 piece of bacon and because our friend didnt take an egg she got an extra sausage wow wee!  I felt the breakfast really let this 5 star hotel down.",4,2012,10,11
226,Plush hotel near Europa Bus Station,"Had a one night stay here in late September as a treat while we were visiting my wife's family, booked a discounted rate online but it was still expensive for what we actually got. We were put in a disabled-access room (e.g. wheelchair-accessible shower) which meant we didn't have a bath in the room unfortunately. Arrived with a car and were told the cost to park in the hotel car park would be ¬£17 as it was valet-service only, which we thought was a little ridiculous. There is a long stay car park across the road however and they gave us a discounted rate as we were staying in the hotel, so it cost us ¬£7 to stay overnight. Parking costs aside, a very useful location if you're driving in as you head straight for Europa once you get off the motorway. The only complaint about the room itself would be that the bed was two mattress pieces joined together, so one person gets a great night's sleep and the other sinks into the gap. Otherwise very-well equipped room and lovely decoration in the hotel itself. Breakfast was charged extra and a little too pricey considering the options nearby.",4,2012,10,09
226,"Great rooms, great location","As always, an absolute pleasure - tho a little expensive.
A great location and the king size beds are just fantastic. 
They have cut back on some of the fine points - big fluffy robes etc - and it's a shame. But still a lovely place",4,2012,10,09
226,Disappointed with our one night stay at the Fitzwilliam,"My wife and I stayed here on Saturday 6th October 2012 on a dinner and room package. First impressions were good staff at reception were pleasant and polite, although initially told us there was no table available for dinner, but quickly resolved. Asked if we needed help with bags or needed any assistance by reception great, good start. Got to our room which was large and spacious and clean. However no water in room except at ¬£3 a bottle from mini bar same for biscuits or fruit so impression was that you were paying for what other hotels supply gratis. Went to bar for a cocktail and found staff great engaged and pleasant. Problems started with dinner. Again not with any of the staff who were again great but ordered a couple of bottles of wine. White arrived but was taken away to the cooler and we had to ask several times for our glasses to be replenished, obviously the cooler was were they kept Steve McQueen. The red was even more difficult, ordered but did not arrive. About 45 minutes later told could not find what I had ordered and manager was sorting, which he did and brought half a dozen bottles for me to chose from, however this was about ten minutes after my main had been served, so no wine. I choose a Margaux (it was my birthday) and it was very good. We spoke to the manager and advised that this was not really what we expected regards service and he was, like all the staff, very ameniable. I therefore expected some gesture of goodwill re charge for the wine. Service has to be important in a five star hotel. When I was shown the bill I had been charged ¬£125 for the Margaux (nice wine but a bit overpriced for a ¬£20 bottle of wine) we had to ask for this charge to be reconsidered and we had it reduced to ¬£100 (the wine I had originally ordered was ¬£38). Proactive not reactive please.
The food in the restaurant seriously lacked any seasoning which resulted in the food, although well presented, being bland and lacking taste.
Breakfast next morning was like going back to school dinners, we all had to wait in line for a table. We waited for ten minutes with people in front and behind us. When we were seated no one told us there was a buffet section, had to ask. There were plenty of free tables and plenty of helpful staff but no organisation hence the wait, not what would be expected from a five star hotel, the breakfast itself was not worth the wait you will get a far better one in Belfast.
Overall a poor performance from a Hotel that ranks as a five star. I would not stay here again as not worth the money would either pay a little bit more and stay at the Merchant or try one of the smaller Boutique Hotels. m",2,2012,10,07
226,Beware the Pre-Theatre visitors,"I know that a ¬£ is a ¬£, and in these hard times all the more welcome. However, I do feel that this hotel has made a strategic mistake in hosting a pre-Theatre Menu. They are ideally situated beside the Opera House, and the upmarket reputation seems to draw the crowds.The night I was there The Mousetrap was playing to full houses, which unfortunately meant that the hotel was swamped, and I mean swamped, with visitors when I ventured out of my room for dinner at 6.30 pm. As there was no table available for me for at least 30 mins, I decided to go downstairs to the bar where I managed to find somewhere to sit. However, there I was ignored for the 30 minutes as 2 waiters tried to serve the 20 or more fully- occupied tables. I spoke to a staff member on the way out and he told me what was going on - I got the impression that he wasn't too delighted about having the whole night's business compressed into 90 minutes. Eventually seated in the restaurant,  I realised that this wasn't really working for the theatre goers either - the couple beside me left without being served at all, and around me diners were calling for their Bills while finishing their main courses, in an effort to get to the Theatre on time. Then at 7.30 calm and quiet was magically restored as the hotel emptied. And I suppose that's the point - it did EMPTY. As the other reviews have stated, the hotel is great, the staff are great, the food was great, the service (once the crowd disappeared) was great, the rooms are great -  but as a tired business traveller who had planed for a quiet, early meal and an early night, this madness was not what I expected of a 5 Star hotel. Maybe the Receptionist could advise guests to remain in their rooms until after 7.30 ?.......PS 17 quid for valet parking seems a bit steep. There is a public carpark a hundred yards or so across the road but a bag, briefcase, computer and heavy rain meant that was never going to happen!",4,2012,10,04
226,Great Hotel Great Location,"Stayed for a weekend in the Fitzwilliam Belfast and it was a great stay. Room was spacious, comfortable and spotless, the bed was huge! Staff were very helpful the concierge couldn't do enough for you. Its in a great location next to the Opera House and within walking distance of the bus tours and shopping centres. I would recommend this hotel for your stay in Belfast which is a great place for a weekend break!",4,2012,10,03
226,Trendy central hotel.,"My husband and I stayed here for a long weekend and could not fault it. Staff were friendly and helpful,cocktails and irish coffees a must and breakfast delicious. The hotel is perfect if you want a break away in comfortable surroundings. Walking distance to some fabulous restaurants and shops. We will look forward to returning soon.",4,2012,09,29
226,Fantastic City Centre Hotel,"Great hotel, large room with good seating area.  Central lotaction, great bar - try the cocktails, good restaurant - very reasonable priced early evening meals, staff wonderful nothing too much trouble.  Really looking forward to going back.

Great city to visit, lots to do.  Staff really helpful in booking tours for you.",5,2012,09,29
226,Delightful hotel,"The Fitzwilliam is very central -- a handsome new building rising on the corner next to the Opera House. Our room on the 7th floor was big, with a comfortable sitting area, huge bathroom and views across to the Antrim hills. It was beautifully dark and quiet at night. The only thing missing was a Nespresso machine, now becoming standard even in 4-star hotels. I loved the d√©cor, which is mustard and black -- such a nice change from the fifty shades of beige you usually get.

The staff are pleasant and friendly. In particular, the young concierge (Daglan?), complete with top hat, was waiting by our taxi to take out bags even before we'd paid the driver. He took us to our room and whizzed off before we could tip him. When we had a small problem with the bath plug the following day, he immediately offered to move us to another room if we didn't want to wait till morning for Maintenance. Naturally, we waited.

The bar and lounge on the ground floor are both pleasant places to relax and the bar does food too. The first-floor restaurant has no windows, which gives a slightly claustrophobic effect; it's all right in the evening but it would be nice to have a view at breakfast. Breakfast is excellent: a buffet and several hot choices, including not only the full Irish but more unusual items such a smoked salmon Benedict.

We had dinner in the restaurant twice during our stay (it was a rainy few days in Belfast). The food is really rather good but we found the young waiters curiously under-trained. They all managed to give the impression that it was their first day of work experience. Waiting tables is not such an unskilled job as many people seem to think and this aspect lets the hotel down.",5,2012,09,28
226,Lovely modern hotel,Great hotel right in the heart of Belfast City Centre. Valet parking is expensive at ¬£17.50 but worth the hassle. Rooms are very modern and spacious.reat breakfast and the bar area is very modern and welcoming.,5,2012,09,25
226,"Great hotel, good location, excellent service","Stayed at this hotel for two nights in September 2012. The service was exceptional, the rooms were beautiful and the cocktail bar was fantastic. Concierge service really helpful recommending restaurants and arranging cabs etc. Parking a little expensive in hotel carpark. Location fantastic to use to get around Belfast city centre. Fantastic location for weekend city break.",5,2012,09,24
226,Recommended,"Everything is positive about this hotel, location, cleanliness, standards etc. apart from one gripe.
Ordered a speciality Belgian beer in the bar (¬£5.90p not cheap !!) and was presented with a warm beer in an appropriate glass. When I complained I was presented with an identical (i.e. warm) bottle. I was willing to compromise and suggested they provide a cold glass, but this was apparently beyond their  capabilities.
Needless to say I refused to pay. Contrast this to the restaurant where the service was very good and the food excellent. Belfast is a great city and well worth a visit !",5,2012,09,24
226,Extremely Disappointing!!,"My husband and I stayed here at the weekend and were really excited, having heard good reviews about it. However, this was short-lived as we weren't very long in our room when we discovered that the flush mechanism on the loo broke every time you pressed it. We did report it, and the concierge and duty manager had a look at it but weren't able to fix it. We were also told that the hotel was full, so they were unable to move us to another room. In my opinion, a flushing loo is a very basic requirement for a hotel, and for this to be the case in a ""5"" star establishment is completely acceptable. 

Definitely won't be back as there are so many better places to stay in Belfast.",2,2012,09,24
226,"Beautiful hotel, fantastic food & wonderful staff!","My mom & I returned to NC from Belfast 8 days ago, and I want to go back right now!  The Fitzwilliam Hotel is located in city centre and very close to many shops, tourist attractions and great restaurants.  The concierges (Kris, Phillip, Declan & Gerard) helped us on many occasions with directions, ideas of what to see next, a new restaurant to try, etc.  Anything we needed, they were there for us!  We also loved having free wifi throughout the hotel (particularly in our beautifully decorated room).

Both the restaurant & bar have delicious food (the breakfast is exceptional!)  Lauren, Stephanie & Robin made sure we had everything we needed every morning (and the evenings we dined at the hotel).  I felt pretty fancy staying in such a beautiful hotel and being treated so well.  I highly recommend The Fitzwilliam!",5,2012,09,21
226,Classy,"We did the Lazy Sunday deal and it was very enjoyable. Once you walk in the door you know this is a quality hotel . The d√©cor is fresh and modern, and when you enter the bedrooms there is a stylish finish to them. The restaurant provides great foods  and there is no hurry to get you out even though the place was busy. Good location with in 5 mins walk to the city hall and the m,ain shopping area. Worth a stay when in Belfast",5,2012,09,21
226,don't get a room with a connecting door,"This is a beautiful hotel and the rooms are lovely - even though we were put in an accessible room without being asked.  Usually I don't mind and quite often the bathrooms are better but in this case the hand basin was so low we had to go into a low squat just to wash our face.  It was also designed for a wheelchair to fit around it so it was also very small and the water splashed all over the floor. 

We also noticed that we had an interconnecting room and I usually don't go on about these things but then the neighbours got back to their room around 11pm and were talking normally while watching telly and the problem was that we heard absolutely everything!  At around 1 am we called down to the front desk to ask for something to be done and they asked the neighbours to be quiet. After reminding them on check out that we had a disturbing night they threw in breakfast.",3,2012,09,20
226,Beautiful Belfast,Spent 3 nights here at this quaint hotel.  It is centrally located and the surrounding city is quite walkable.  From this spot to the Titanic Quarter is about a 15 minute walk.  The bar is cozy and be sure to end your evening with the hot port.  Couldn't get enough of it.  Brian from the bar was an awesome server.  Also try Whites Tavern for authentic Irish food.  Brian recommended it and he was spot on.,4,2012,09,19
226,"top notch is an overused word,but this hotel is real quality","i cant really name one person . everyone was professional,and friendly.as an expression goes if they were your children. you would say they are a credit to there parents.well mannered and patient.there wasa was a night reception gentleman that sticks in my head he was so nice,but again that goes for everyone.this hotel is worth a stay if you want to leave belfast with the best impression of belfast,and northern irish people in general.
   also great service,and value for money for what you get.

226,Great hotel in the heart of the city,"We spent a weekend in Belfast and stayed in the Fitzwilliam Hotel.  The decor in the hotel was fabulous, and our room was even better.  The room was nice and big with loads of cupboard space and a massive bathroom and an over-sized bathtub.   The staff at the hotel were very friendly and helpful.  We bought a package that included dinner and breakfast.  The food in the restaurant was good, but the menu didn't have as much variety as I'd hoped.   You could not get a more convenient hotel, which is right in the middle of the city center.  All around a great place, and I would definitely go back again.",4,2012,09,17
226,Not without its problems,"This is the third hotel I've stayed in while in Belfast having previously stayed in the Europa and the Hilton. The hotel is a stylish modern hotel located in the heart of Belfast. It is next door to the Opera house and minutes walk the town hall and about 15 minutes walk to Victoria Square.

The hotel is a long narrow hotel, shoe-horned into a corner of a street. This makes the hotel layout suffer buy having long pokey resturaunt and bar killing the atmosphere somewhat. The rooms while very tastefully decorated and well equipped are smaller than you would expect. 

The main problem I encountered was the following; I checked in for my wedding anniversary hoping for a relaxing stay. I informed the hotel prior to travelling that it was a special occassion, now this wasn't to get freebies, it was to hopefully not be put into one of the cheap rooms that every hotel has. When we got to the room we found it was adjacent to the elevator, once inside the room we could heard the overly loud elevator buzzer which in a busy hotel like this went off frequently. As for a relaxing stay I wasnt planning to listen to this constant buzzing. I went to the hotel reception and told them my problem and they had no problem offering me the key to another room to view to see if it was suitable. This room had a heavy smell of cigarette smoke. Now the hotel is a none smoking hotel which issues BIG fines to those who breach that rule. So I went to reception and rather than being any more difficult I told them I would just stay in the original room. With that the receptionist told me they had checked me out of that room and someone else had checked in. This all occured over about a 10 minute period. It transpires that when they gave me the key to view the second room they checked me immediately out of the first, even those my luggage was still there and I had items in the safe. I dont know what the receptionish was thinking doing that and the concierge was also confused as to why she had checked me out and another couple into the same room. Now ordinarly I would just put this down to her having a bad day but on checkout the same girl messed up my bill and tried to over change me by checking me out of the wrong room even though I had given her the room number mere seconds before. For me the hotel reception staff is the face of the hotel and they really need to be on their game, this is the reason why I wont stay in this hotel again.

The hotel is in a good location, it is a very contemporary stylish hotel which I would recommend for business only. It certainly was not a romantic hotel stay.",3,2012,09,17
226,Wonderful week in Belfast,"My daughter & I spent a week in Belfast doing family research (all arranged by Melita Williams of BespokeBelfast--fabulous).  We stayed at the Fitzwilliam and couldn't have been more pleased.  The staff is beyond wonderful, there was nothing that we asked that they didn't do.  We felt so safe and well taken care of!!!  The included breakfast was delicious, dinners in the bar & main dining room were always great and the staff there were terrific, too.  The hotel is located in a very centrally located area and it's easy to walk to stores, restaurants and tourist sights.  Our room was attractive and kept spotlessly clean--would have loved to have more storage in the bathroom, though...     I would stay in the Fitzwilliam again without hesitation.  Great hotel!!!!!!!",5,2012,09,16
226,Excellent hotel in excellent Belfast,"It is only now that I've thought to review this property. My wife and I stayed for 2 nights in Dec 11 and enjoyed a very pleasant stay. The hospitality was not only excellent here but also in Belfast as a whole. I must say that as a Corkman with very limited experience of Northern Ireland, both the city and the hotel would very much entice me back - a city that's interested in looking after tourists and a hotel that does a good job in doing so too!",4,2012,09,16
226,Best hotel room ever!,"Do you know one of these days? You have arrived at your destination and your baggage has not been delivered, the weather is gray, you had an argument with your loved one before leaving, you forget something, it is cold, your reason to be here is not a nice one, your boss was angry with you before you left?
I had exactly such a day when arriving in Belfast earlier this month. A bit frustrated I entered the hotel at 9am and luckily my room was already ready. As soon as I entered it my mood completely changed. I have been in a couple of hundred hotel rooms around the globe but this has been the best one!

The room was huge. It was a corner room where there was a window front in the corner. A full hifi stereo is provided, not some cheap radio. A flat screen is of course also mounted. The bed is free standing, meaning you can walk around it. Behind the bad there is a really nice desk with a lot of space. In front of the bed, just next to the window is a long sofa facing the inside of the room. The bathroom is open towards the room, but if you want, you can close the door so it is fully separated. The separation between the Bath and the room is a bathtub which you can enter from the bath or the room (if the separating doors are open) the bathtub is rather large and also has a shower. The details make the difference - a candle is provided next to the bathtub. 
Now if you think you don‚Äôt like taking a shower in a bathtub you don't need to worry. There is also another shower, which is almost same in size. In between the shower and the bathtub is the toilet and the lavabo with a huge mirror. There is also a wardrobe with a safe and   minibar. In the sleeping area there are a lot of lamps which are all dimmable and can be controlled from the bed. Let's put it this way: it is a waste to stay alone in this room.
There are some metal rails along the windows where you can perfectly get your hands on and look outside and dream or.....
The room is very well designed in terms of shape and colors. It is a designer room, kept in dark colors with bright highlights (e.g. The sofa). I loved the room including all details. 

I cannot comment on the health club neither the breakfast nor the restaurant as I did not make use of those facilities. According to ma travel guide the restaurant should be pretty good as well. The reception is very friendly and the concierge is also helpful. What I did not like though was that the concierge did not serve me as friendly as if I was wearing a suit. I think that is totally unnecessary - if I was dressed very formally (who does on holiday) they would have treated me differently. 

Wireless internet is available for free in the hotel. They are using the room/name as credentials which is very convenient in case you have multiple devices as you don‚Äôt need to ask for many vouchers

Before I stayed in this room I always wanted my master bedroom in the house I am going to build to be as the rooms in the Radisson Blu Media Hafen in Dusseldorf - not because it was the biggest or best room but because of the layout. This has changed now, the room should look like the one I had in the Fitzwilliam Hotel. This might hardly be possible as I think I am missing the required funds ;). My loved one would have to be rich instead of pretty, intelligent and loving. Mhhhmm, I think I keep it the other way round, this allows me to always look forward to nice hotel rooms and hopefully not too many times alone. 

If you have the possibility to stay in the Fitzwilliam, do it! Ask for a room in the corner, the number should be x02 (x ist the floor). The bus from the city airport as well as the one from (and of course also to) the Belfast International Airport stop next door in the Europa bus center. The shopping center at Victoria square is 6min on foot away and the city hall area is only 4min away. There are a couple of little stores just opposite the street and a liquor store is 3 blocks away - making it a very convenient location to do business in Belfast or to touristy explore the city.",5,2012,09,15
226,Very plush & trendy,"My husband stayed in the Fitzwilliam hotel in Belfast for a saturday night in August. We got a deal online - ¬£149 for B&B and dinner in the restaurant, which we felt was good value for a hotel of that standard. We had stayed in the Dublin Fitzwilliam hotel before so we had a good idea of the standard. The bedroom was lovely, very modern, with a lovely bathroom. The shower wasn't great in terms of water pressure, but it wasn't too bad. I HATED the toiletries, they had a horrible aniseed smell, but that might just be personal taste. 

Our dinner was nice, though the menu offered a lot less options than we saw online, however we found the the food to be of a very good standard considering the price we paid. We found the service to be very hap-hazard however. We ordered a bottle of white wine and it was taken away from us to be placed in an ice bucked at the other side of the restaurant. this meant we had to wait for the staff to pour wine. I found it very annoying. Also the staff had a habit of disappearing for ages so we spent ages waiting for them to come to take our order, or pour the wine. After our dinner we had to wait for ages for them to clear the plates. The waiter asked did we want to see the dessert menu, we said yes. He disappeared for about 15 minutes and we didn't see any other staff members either. I eventually had to get up and walk out of the restaurant to find a waiter and waitress having a laugh just at the door. I told them we'd been wondering if they'd all gone to bed, and they were obviously mortified as they sprang into action after that. They were very polite, all apologies and offered us a free drink to compensate. I just wish they'd been so attentive all night. 

The following morning we had breakfast in the same restaurant. It was one of the nicest breakfasts I've had. Almost every hotel has a buffet breakfast with cooked eggs, bacon and sausages all sitting in hot plates wilting by the minute. However in the Fitzwilliam the breakfasts were cooked to order. My husband had eggs benedict and I had poached eggs on toast. it was really lovely. There was a buffet with fruit, bread, pastries, and cold meats and cheese. 

I'd recommend the Fitzwilliam to anyone. The service in the restaurant let us down but otherwise, it was a very pleasant stay, and for ¬£149 it was very good value.",4,2012,09,12
226,Fantastic,"What a find. Beautiful property, great staff. We had a great night out in Belfast started in the bar at the hotel. Our hangover breakfast was amazing. So delight not to be greeted by the typical stale buffet style hotel crap. Lauren and her beautiful eyes served our table to the highest standards while also being friendly and polite.

We will be back soon again. Next time we hope you guys have a pool too. Then this hotel would be even better. ",5,2012,09,12
226,"Regulars to the Fitz, but very poor behaviour from night staff results in no further return.","We have always loved the Fitzwilliam. Great rooms, lovely bar and ideally situated to the city centre. We are frequent stayers however during our last visit we received appalling service and behaviour frm the night guard on the doors. He swore at us and denied us access to the bar after returning from a meal and some drinks with friends. This is NOT how paying customers should be spoken to in any which way and due to tis we will to be returning again. A previous review on 29/07 stated a similar issue, with Fitwilliam staff responding to advise this would be addressed and dealt with, nd not gone in noticed. It seems it has unfortunately fallen on deaf ears. Very disappointing.",2,2012,09,11
226,"Uneven, but worth a second chance","I stayed here for five nights on a business trip, and found it to be something of a mixed bag.  On the positive side, the location is great, the rooms are very handsomely decorated, internet is at no extra cost, the staff are welcoming and friendly, housekeeping is great, and the food in the hotel bar is better than you would expect.  So there is much to like about The Fitzwilliam.  Less positively, however, the room I originally book (702) was stiflingly hot and the air conditioner did not work. This made the room permanently uncomfortable, for either working, relaxing, or sleeping.  This is an issue for the entire hotel, as other Trip Advisor reviewers have noted; but the Fitzwilliam has done nothing about it. I raised it with the staff, but nothing was done.  When I raised it a second time, I was moved to a splendid (indeed, larger) room (811), where the air conditioner was working.  But why should that have to happen at all?  What if there had been no other rooms? The so-called business centre is a joke: a printer and two computer terminals, both of which were broken.  So in fact there was no business centre.  Im the restaurant I had to send an omelette back because it was burned all over -- how did it ever leave the kitchen in the first place?  I also ate in the bar every evening, and the food was good.  However, the quality of service deteriorated throughout the week, to the point where simple things -- like tortilla chips -- did not arrive and I had to enlist the help of other staff to see that what I ordered reached my table. On balance I'm willing to give this hotel another chance, but it needs to sort things out and stop expecting quests to pay nearly 200L a night for a hot airless room, however attractively furnished.",3,2012,09,11
226,Fab 5 star,"The hotel has fabulous and chic interior design throughout which I loved. We got a fantastic room right on the corner of the building overlooking the crossroads. Floor to ceiling windows surrounding this corner which was really cool to look out of and despite the room location we could not hear the street traffic which was great. The room was very comfortable and spacious. Everything you would expect from a 5 star hotel was met. The location is very central, perfect for reaching the shops and going out in the evening. Although we didn't eat at the hotel, we went to the bar for drinks and the cocktails they served were delicious. Would certainly stay again for that bit of city centre luxury. ",5,2012,09,10
226,Fantastic hotel and location,"T'was my 40th birthday and my wife booked us a suite on the 8th floor. Fantastic views. Room was a great size, modern and comfortable. The bed was huge, firm but not too firm. Duvet almost too warm. Fantastic wet room. Didnt eat there as we had other plans but breakfast was very good indeed. Had a few 'shandies' that night and every time i got up to go to the loo I was tackled by a large floor to ceiling light/lantern that was very badly placed (one at either side at the foot of the bed). I nearly tore the thing out of the ceiling!! Wouldnt have fancied replacing it if I had of. Bad positioning. But thats my only complaint. Classy hotel in a great location. You need no more. Come visit!!",5,2012,09,10
226,Great hotel,"We stayed here for 3 nights and it was great. We had a clean, comfortable and good-sized room. Internet is free and that's a big plus especially if you are comparing to hotels like Europa and Hilton. I am glad I cancelled my Hilton reservation and instead used Fitzwilliam. For the same amenities, we saved a lot more. The breakfast selection is awesome. Checkout was fast. It is in a good location too and you can walk to almost everything. This is my favorite hotel in Belfast thus far after staying in 3 different properties.",5,2012,09,09
226,"Loved it, very glam and comfortable","Stayed here as it was a gift, loved it from walking in the door.

226,"Bullying, homophobic security","A group of us booked 15 rooms for a 40th birthday. On returning to the hotel after a great party we were greeted by an aggressive doorman, who claimed to be head of security. He denied entry to some of us even though we had room cards. On realising that there were rooms being shared by men he launched into a homophobic rant singling out one couple saying 'those men will not be sharing a room here'. He searched our rooms for people he said we had smuggled in. There were no smuggled people. He said that 'your type are not welcome here...don't come back'. A truly threatening experience. My complaint on checking out was ignored until I had phoned the hotel several times to get a response. Even then they seemed disinterested. I would not advise anyone to visit this hotel if you are thinking of returning late and using the bar. I would rather have slept on a bench in the bus station.",1,2012,09,08
226,Lovely stay in a first class hotel!,This hotel is in an excellent location for the city centre and close to the train and bus station.  The rooms are comfortable food was nice and the cocktails were brilliant!  Lots of bars and restaurants nearby.,5,2012,09,08
226,Excellent,"This hotel is clean, spacious, and has a great location in the city.  An added bonus was the size of the bathroom -- a full size shower and a full size tub, which is almost unheard of in Europe.

The staff were very gracious and helpful!",5,2012,09,07
226,thanks from the yanks!!!,"Just back from a great vacation in Ireland and had an awesome few days in the Fitzwilliam hotel. All the staff were so welcoming and helpful.

226,Want to go home!!,"Check in was fine, girl behind the desk was pleasant enough, lift up to rooms was quite small, room was clean , bed not to bad, decor was a bit black, White , orange & lime! Not my taste!! Hotel bar awful, booths that my parter couldn't have shared with me, tables that reminded me of an airport, staff uniform that resembled Easy Jet staff!! Cocktails awful & staff just not up to scratch, we moved from the bar dew to the bad music to the lobby seating, while sitting there 2 tramps came in  sat down with a bottle if cider , 2 members of staff walked by noticing these people & ignored their presence . Breakfast was v. Average, uncomfortable red chairs, we were seated beside the "" hot"" toaster machine that had turned the butter sour , the cooked breakfast was fried & is still making me feel ill !! This experience cost me ¬£150, far to expensive in my eyes ¬£95 would have been plenty!! We won't be coming back to this hotel . Please don't make the same mistake we did :(",1,2012,09,02
226,Luxury in Belfast!,Stayed here for a night as a treat on a family visit to Belfast.  The hotel is situated in the city centre and is close to the shops and bats and restaurants.

226,A great hotel in a central location,"My husband & I stayed at the Fitzwilliam for 5 nights and had a very comfortable stay. The staff members were very friendly, the room was spacious and clean, the bathroom was great and the bed was very comfortable. The attention to detail was impressive - I came back after the first day to find that my toothpaste tube had been smoothed out! Breakfast service was a bit haphazard (excellent some mornings, not so much on others) but the food was delicious - I am originally from Belfast & perhaps have been away too long to appreciate the more relaxed attitude to life :-) The bar is large and comfortable and the cocktail list is extensive. The location is great, very central for museums, theater, music venues, transportation, shops, bars and restaurants. The concierge staff was very prompt in bringing our car round and were also very friendly and cheerful. The only small downside was the wake up call system which seems to have a few quirks. One day we did not get a call at all, the next day it came an hour earlier than requested. The staff members were very apologetic and it really was a very minor issue. Overall, I highly recommend the Fitzwilliam.",4,2012,08,31
226,Great hotel in great location (just a bit too hot!)h,"Loved the decor of the whole hotel, especially the lobby and the fire art.  Staff were friendly, helpful and professional. Food was top rate and service was perfect. Best Irish coffee I have ever had!

The gym was opposite my room which was very convenient and it felt like my personal add-on :o)

Opposite the hotel is the Shopping mall which has one of the DeLoreans from the Back to the Future films inside, complete with the original flux capacitor and time circuits etc.  Definitely go and see it!

On the downside the air conditioning didn't work and to make things worse none of my windows opened (by design) which meant my room was permanently too hot.",4,2012,08,29
226,"Nothing Special, Even When You Are Celebrating A Special Occasion!","Stayed here  whilst visiting Belfast.  Had also booked room for parents  50th Wedding Anniversary (mentioned this in booking form and separate email).  Room allocated to parents was overlooking air conditioning units and was dark due to the surrounding buildings. Our room was slightly better and ended up switching rooms with them (this was eventually done after alot of talking with front desk).  So much for mentioning special occasion, hotel did not even acknowledge this!!!.  The only thing I can say about this hotel was the good breakfast next day and the excellent staff at breakfast.  If you are celebrating a special occasion and are looking for a hotel which will add that extra touch, this is not the hotel for it...  Sorry but won't be returning.  We had dropped into a hotel next door for a bit to eat and the way we were treated by the staff there, you would think we had been staying in this hotel!!! Yes, we were made feel like guests!!!!",3,2012,08,29
226,"Beautiful hotel, excellent staff!","Stayed here with my hubby over the bank holiday weekend in a luxury suite.  The hotel is beautiful and the service was excellent even though they were very busy. I would recommend paying the little extra for a suite for the floor to ceiling windows which provided a fantastic panoramic view of Belfast. The double rain showers and sinks were lovely and the open plan layout meant that you could take a bath and enjoy the view.  The lovely candles, rose petals and chocolates added a lovely touch of romance.  Excellent, really could not fault this hotel and have many to compare too. You really must go!",5,2012,08,29
226,"Nice modern rooms, poor dinner.","Stayed with my fiance for a nights dinner b&b. Rooms were clean and modern. Bar was lovely and nice atmosphere. Had a 3 course dinner in restaurant. Portion sizes were very small for the amount we payed! All 3 courses would of made up 1 meal. Food was nice but not amazing. Breakfast was ok but I've had better in many other hotels. Good for a few drinks in the bar but that's it, there are plenty of other places in Belfast that a far better for a meal.",3,2012,08,29
226,Excellent service & Great Food,"Had a very nice stay at the Fitzwilliam. Located right in the heart of Belfast it's only a short walk to the shops and other attractions. 

The food in the restaurant was top notch and the set menu was very reasonable for two people",4,2012,08,29
226,OK,"Very dark drab decor, all dark brown black green grey and very sparse lighting, our rm overlooked the back, bathroom black tiles hallway you need a torch, mini bar prices shouldnt b allowed never had anything but because we 'nosied' it triggered a sensor, ¬£3.50 for a can o coke!! get real!!!! staff friendly breakfast decent (no beans) the overall stay wasnt unpleasant but wont be back. sorry",3,2012,08,27
226,"Recommended and modern,","Just after a 3 night break in the fitzwilliam hotel and it was amazing. Booked through booking.com n got 3 nights no breakfast for ¬£276 sterling. Amazing value, we just stayed in there excutive king sized room, modern very clean funky interior and colours, free wifi for hotel guests can b used through out the hotel. Less than ten min walk from the main shopping area and a further 5 min walk to Victoria square shopping centre. We did taxi once or twice and it was round 3.50-4.60 max for any trip. Easily walk 2 oddessy and titanic quarter. Only thing we found hard to find was places to eat and bars are few and far between, we ate in TGI Fridays all 3 days at 1 point. Car park at hotel is17 per night  and available on reserving, from 2 o clock check in time, we arrived at 12 and there is a mc causland car park behind the hotel which is 14 stg per night so we stayed there can't pre book though but has plenty of spaces. Drinks in hotel are expensive but that's normal with any hotel bar eg small glass red wine 8stg and frozen daquairi 8stg and appletini 6stg, needless to say nt 2 many drinks were had. I would go back and would recommend easily find your bearings from hotel. Oh another little point centra shop is directly across the road from front door of hotel so handy for papers and little munches.

226,Excellent hotel and brilliant location.,"Stayed at this hotel this week for a series of concerts in the city. The location was fantastic, right at the bus stop for the buses to the concert and within walking distance to the shopping area. The room was fabulous with a huge, comfy bed and beautifully clean and spacious bathroom. The front desk staff were very friendly and helpful and the bar staff were also very friendly.",5,2012,08,23
226,Good trip to Belfast and Donaghadee,"We had a wonderfuly stay at the Fitzwilliam Hotel, lovely hotel to stay at, new hotel, very clean, and terrific Staff. We enjoyed our tour of Belfast, more importantly we spent one day at the Beautiful ""Donaghadee"", it was just a perfect day, would like to visit Donaghadee again for a relaxing stay.  Had a good lunch at the Grace Miles pub.",5,2012,08,23
226,MODERN AND CENTRAL HOTEL,"A very modern hotel centrally situated in downtown Belfast,  recently built on the site of what was a cinema.  It is on the corner of Great Victoria Street / Grosvenor Road which is probably one of the busiest traffic junctions in the city, however the soundproofing within the hotel is such that you really hear very little going on outside. Air conditioned room was very comfortable. Lovely supply of toiletries, hospitality tray (with fresh coffee and coffee maker) and complimentary bottled water. There is a mini bar in the room but we did not use it. Bathrooms are well equipped with bath and shower, floor tiles are non slip. 
We had breakfast and it was plentiful and of a high standard. 
All staff we encountered could not have been more helpful or friendly.",5,2012,08,23
226,fantastic city break,"We stayed for two nights midweek at the Fitzwilliam, I was anxious to pack as much sightseeing in as possible so i rang the concierge to get suggestions,he suggested a private tour to the giants causeway and the political tour in the afternoon,he arranged everything and offered us directions when we rang later.When we arrived my husband commented how lovely everyone was and our room was beautiful,sparkling clean and very tastefully decorated,so nice in fact I took pics in case we redecorate in the future.. The first night we arrived we ate at the  restaurant on level 1 and it was gorgeous,the only thing I could fault was the cr√®me brulee sugar crust (too thick, a first world problem I know).The following morning we went with Pat to the causeway,the distillery and in the afternoon the political tour,we were about 8 hours out and about and it cost ¬£135,it was absolutely perfect for us to be driven and dropped to where we wanted.I cant say enough about the guide he was really fantastic,very well informed and gave us a great even overview of the political history of Belfast.Fabulous Hotel, warm and friendly staff and great restaurant...just brilliant! FYI the shower is amazballs..",5,2012,08,22
226,Grand for ¬£85 B&B,"Grand job. 
Beware ¬£17 parking charge.
Rooms nice.
Residents bar good.
Bar snack nice.
Breakfast grand and delivered to room for ¬£5 (not sure if that was per head or not, so could have been ¬£10 per couple)",4,2012,08,22
226,Loved it!,"Will def be back! Couldn't fault the room or the staff and they were able to help us out to no end! The food in the bar was great and reasonable and the cocktails were lovely, with the barman able to recommend 'specials' for us!",5,2012,08,21
226,Fitzwilliam Hotel,"this hotel is very central for shopping, sightseeing and entertainment, situated next to the Opera House. It is a very modern, comfortable and clean hotel, the staff are very pleasant and helpful, i will definately  stay here again, when visiting Belfast.",5,2012,08,20
226,Absolutely Brillant,"Love this hotel.. Most gorgeous hotel i have stayed in.

Rooms were spacious and very modern, you got a mini fridge, wine glasses, bathrobes and slippers a massive bathroom with a big bath and a massive shower also..

staff were lovely and very helpful

I would recommend this hotel you will get your moneys worth and i definitely will be back!!!",5,2012,08,20
226,"A comfortable stay, but a couple of one off problems","We stayed here for three nights during a long weekend trip to Belfast. 

Before arrival we had been able to request a twin room and the concierge had been very helpful replying to emails about things we wanted to do. 

The hotel is very comfortable, is in a great location and the staff were very friendly and helpful. Our room was clean and very quiet, and the beds were very comfortable. We slept very well for two out of the three nights. 

However, I don't think we would stay in the hotel again if in Belfast. There were a number of small things during our stay which would put me off. The main one of these was being called by the front desk at 02:08 to be told that our taxi was waiting. As we hadn't booked a taxi this came as a shock. We were given no apology by the person on the phone and it meant we were then both wide awake. There was also some trouble to be charged the correct amount for breakfast, where the initial bill was twice what is should have been. This was only rectified at checkout. These were not big problems and it is a very nice hotel, but I will probably not use it again.",3,2012,08,19
226,An unexpected pleasure,"Not knowing Belfast and being on a cost-conscious business trip, I fully expected to find myself billeted in a boring budget bedroom, so this was a very pleasant surprise. Not much if anything got described as chic in Belfast for many years, so it's a mark of how far the city has come that a hotel which could hold its own for style in any major city is here. Comfortable, well furnished rooms and a large, welcoming bar add to the ambience. Recommended.",4,2012,08,17
226,Good central hotel,"Good room, comfortable, well presented with good amenities; cafetiere for coffee a nice touch.
Staff all very friendly, helpfuland welcoming.
Bar good for post dinner drinks (& catch up on Olympic action after dinner!); lunch food here also good.
Late check out no problem.

Couple of errors:
Mini-bar almost empty on arrival - could lead to a large bill/argument on check-out; luckily we checked and it was rectified. 
Another guests bar bill was added to our check - rectfied immediately on notification; this error was down to the other guests error in recording room number however staff should check on room numbers/names on signing.
Drinks prices on bar menu and billed prices are different - no excuses should be accurate not ""out of date""..

Overall we like this hotel a lot, above are niggles or things to watch out for that could easily be corrected. WIll return here if back in Belfast.",4,2012,08,16
226,Very good hotel,"Stayed here for one night, we really enjoyed our stay.
The reception staff, restaurant staff and the porter/concierge were really helpful.
This hotel is centrally located.
The beds are comfortable.
I agree with one of the earlier reviews that the ¬£17 for parking is expensive, that was the only fault.
We would stay here again.",4,2012,08,15
226,Lovely hotel,"Stayed at the Fitzwilliam for my first trip to Belfast went with friends who had been there before and wasn't disapppointed, reception lovely and welcoming with friendly efficient staff and porters. Had a few drinks at the bar also a lovely place to sit.  Room was large with good views, comfortable bed and CD/Radio, TV etc and mini fridge. Bathroom was large with good shower and separate bath and spotlessley clean.  Only downside would be the bill, offer not taken off for our rooms and second bill still overcharged, also noticed that we were charged twice for drinks in the bar, at ¬£29 a round its worth checking your bill before you leave, all in all we would come back.",4,2012,08,14
226,"lovely hotel,great staff","Stayed for two nights with my wife and son.Everything about this hotel is class. Staff are friendly and helpful, room was excellent, bar food was very good its a nice bright room,breakfast was very good.If i was trying to be picky 17 pounds per night for parking is a little to much,thats the only reason i didnt give it excellent overall.",4,2012,08,14
226,"Brilliant hotel, lovely staff, great weekend.",There is not one negative thing I could say about our stay at the fitzwilliam on saturday 11th august 2012. We were treated so well compared to the hilton were we were looked down upon somewhat because we weren't upper class enough looking! We had a beautiful dinner in the restaurant the staff were really helpful. Could not ask for better our room was amazing everything we needed and more. I will definitely be staying again.,5,2012,08,12
226,"Great location, great hotel","We spent three nights here for our first time in Belfast.  We did have a mystery half price hotel deal from lastminute.com so at ¬£58 per night excluding parking and breakfast this was superb value. Declan, the concierge was both friendly and helpful. Recommended ",5,2012,08,12
226,perfect - hope it never changes,"We spent out wedding night there. We're not picky but I work in a similar luxury environment and with the public all the time, so I'm trained to pick things up even when I don't want to:(. WEll this is as close to perfect customer service as I have ever seen: friendly, helpful, polite. Not fake-posh, not fake-friendly, just super nice. Executive room, very nice decor if you're into boutique style hotel. Perfect large bed. Good bar selection in the room- bar the herbal teas which I usually drink. very nice bathroom, really clean and nice size tub. Loved the little candle-matches detail in the bathroom for the tub - we actually used it. We were absolutely impressed with the restaurant after being slightly disappointed with a very famous downtown place earlier in the day for our wedding party - really wish we could have booked it there. We both agreed, def this is or new spot In Belfast. Congrats to the maitre-d, the staff were just wonderful without being overbearing, appearing and disappearing at just the right times; love to see good old fashion training like that, very hard to find nowadays; the steaks we had were possibly some of the best ever, just the right amount of rucola  too which I love; didn't want to order desert really,  nothing could have topped it. Breakfast was just as  good. We'll be def coming back, no need for us to look anywhere else.",5,2012,08,11
226,Nice hotel,"This was a surprise visit to Belfast booked by my husband to celebrate my 50th birthday.  We stayed for 4 nights and the hotel room was large and comfortable and the bathroom was a good size with both a bath and shower cubicle.  However, on our first morning we realised that the shower door did not shut properly.  We therefore hesitated to use the shower as we were concerned about leakage onto the bathroom floor.  No problem - we had baths instead and reported the problem to the receptionist who said she would get it sorted.  We returned after a day out to find the shower door still did not close.  We reported it again the next day and were told that someone had been to look at it but could not fix the problem.  This was okay with us but it would have been nice if a note had been left the previous day to let us know this.  When we returned that evening there was a note in our room advising that we were to be moved to another room - the one next door.  The weird thing was that the shower in that bathroom had no door at all!!!!!  It was very nice of them to move us but we would have been happy to stay in the original room (I liked it better even though the rooms were mirror images of each other).

We didn't eat there at all so could not comment on the restaurant or bar.  The rooms have facilities to make tea and coffee (not very nice coffee) tucked away into a cupboard.  The mattresses were quite soft so I woke up with backache each morning.

Belfast is a lovely city but I think I will probably look for a different hotel if I ever get to visit again.",3,2012,08,09
226,Fab room. Everything you need.,Stayed here for four nights and it was great. The rooms are very comfortable and the staff were all friendly. The bedrooms were luxurious and everywhere was immaculately clean. Hotel is within walking distance of all major attractions. Would definitely go again. ,5,2012,08,06
226,Fantastic stay at 'The Fitzwilliam',"My wife and I have stayed at the Fitzwilliam Hotel Belfast on the weekend of 27th-29th July. We had a very pleasant stay at this hotel and if we are lucky enough to return to Belfast in the future, we will now automatically book the Fitzwilliam.
The reasons why we enjoyed the hotel:
Great location, Pleasant staff, Good value for money, nice rooms (bed was incredibly comfy), good hotel to relax, clean hotel, we didn't require anything else as it ticked all the buttons for our weekend trip. The hotel bar is also a very good spot to relax. We had been sightseeing during the days we were there, so we wanted a relaxed environment to enjoy a few drinks, have bite to eat and chill out. We could do all of this in the hotel bar, fantastic addition to the hotel. I would also like to recommend the bar staff, all very courteous and my wife tried a few of the cocktails and said they were all superb. Also, I would like to say thanks to reception as although we were not due to check-in until 3pm, a room was made available to us at 12-30.
So all in all, thanks to the Fitzwilliam hotel for a great weekend and I would definitely recommend this hotel and we will stay here the next time we return to the city.",5,2012,08,06
226,It Fitz the bill,"Our second stay at the Fitz in 3 years. Into an unchanged reception area, smiles and speedy, efficient check in. To the fifth floor and a lovely, spacious, comfortable room with a decent view of the Jury's opposite and the city beyond. The bathroom had both bath and a large raindrop shower. No need for an engineering degree to operate this equipment. A nice touch was the smallish area of the mirror that didn't mist up after the shower was used. We appreciate that this can't be cheap but could it be a little larger to accommodate all heights rather than the average as we found it?

Downstairs again - in the seating area the FT & local papers were readily available and a range of books was displayed. Outside, the Grand Opera House was next door and across the road  the institution that is the Crown Liquor Saloon or Bar. A visit here is mandatory; the place is a throwback to the 1930s. The beer was good and the clientele friendly. Sadly, they'd stopped selling baseball caps & t-shirts. Shame on them!

10 minutes to the City Centre and on to the Cathedral Quarter. Back in the Fitzwilliam and the welcoming bar; they served good snack food and decent wine & cocktails at acceptable prices.
The only poor piece of service happened here on Monday (30 July); two barmen on duty and the experienced guy went to make love to the bar computer leaving the 3 day man to cope with several orders including our Rusty Nail. We passed on some advice to the older guy as we left the bar!

There were lots of bars and reataurants in the immediate area; we tried South James Street but but were told we needed reservations as it was fully booked. This was disproved about 90 minutes later when a glance through the window revealed more empty seats than at the Olympics. Avoid! 

So it was over the road to Irene & Nan's. We were not put off by our first impression; a little attention was needed. The food, wine and service were all impeccable and represented very good value for money.

Our Fitzwilliam room had more than sufficient wardrobe space, a good TV, iron & ironing board, safe, CD player and a mini bar. The aircon was discreet and although some street noise reached us, it was not intrusive.

Our final morning and under the door was a fully itemised - and totally accurate - bill. Checkout was smooth and our luggage was stored for us via the Concierge who later handled our taxi transfer with professional aplomb.

We're happy to recommend the Fitzwilliam as a good base for enjoying Belfast. We will be back, soon.",4,2012,08,05
226,Fabulous - thank you!,"The Fitzwilliam is similar to some of the high-end contemporary / boutiquey versions of well known 4-5 star hotels that have sprung up in London over the last few years; only the Fitz has way more character and doesn't make you haemorrhage money.

Everything was top knotch; friendly greeting at reception, large comfortable room, huge bed, free wi-fi, great housekeeping.  The location is great too.  I can't remember exactly how much we paid, but it was a fairly modest amount and the Fitz definately over-delivered against expectations.

The highlight for us was the (family friendly) cocktail bar.  We came to Belfast mainly for the Titanic exhibition but if anything's going to make us return, it's what mixologist Jonathan has up his sleeve for Manhattans / old fashioneds!",5,2012,08,02
226,"Hot & Small, but very friendly !","Nice new Hotel in central Belfast, but I found the room was very small and despite their best efforts, they couldn't get the Air Conditioning to work (well they could, but only blowing out hot air!).
Decor was nice, but shower and bath arrangements were let down by poor water pressure (half hour run time for a bath).
Staff were very friendly and helpful though.",3,2012,08,01
226,New kid on the block - definitely worth a try,"I arrived at half past midnight after a long hard day, an obligatory work dinner and probably one too many glasses of red wine. There was no booking for me as the travel agency had messed up. The staff on the counter were immensely helpful and after some bustling around (I wasn't sure they were 100% sure how to resolve the situation - they seemed very young and a bit green to be on the counter at nearly 1am), they managed to get me into the last room. Thanks chaps. 

The room was really lovely and I am sorry I wasn't staying longer to enjoy it. I was up at 6am, enjoyed the lovely coffee in my room (very decent quality), ironed my clothes (didnt need to ask for an iron), blow dried my hair (at last a hairdryer in a hotel that wasnt designed for a baldie with a combover). I then went to the 1st floor and had a great breakfast. I found the waiting staff to be attentive without being annoying (especially at that time of the morning!) and the range of food on offer as part of the continental deal was varied, fresh and delicious.",5,2012,07,31
226,Bed big enough to get lost in!,"Standard room booked. 

Good points:-
Comfortable bed, 
Spacious bathroom with walk in shower with seperate bath,
Clean and well maintained room,
Quiet room with little or no road noise (might have to request this on booking),
Bathrobes (on request),
Good selection of tea, instant coffee and ground coffee in room tray. 

Bad points:-
Bathrobes - one size fits all!  
Don't think so, unless you are under 5'5"" and thin (mental note - now I know why the receptionist smiled when I requested a set). 

Overall a lovely hotel in a central location providing much needed rest and luxury.",5,2012,07,31
226,Lovely room and huuuuuge bed!,"I was lucky enough to be taken away on a long weekend to NI by my boyfriend and we stayed on our first and last nights at the Fitzwilliam. On arriving at 10.30am on the first occasion, we asked if we could leave our bags at the hotel while we went out to get some lunch. However, we didn't need to do this in the end as our room was ready! Great service. The lady on check in (who was there for check in and check out on each occasion) was lovely and very friendly. Both rooms we had (608 and 710) were large, nicely decorated, air conditioned, and very very clean. The bathrooms were spotless and both the shower and bath were large with nice touches, such as the lovely toiletries and the candle with matches. But the best bit had to be the beds! They were absolutely enormous and very very comfortable. At one point my boyfriend rang down to obtain a steam iron (as the one in the room wasn't) and, when it arrived, we got the impression that they'd gone out to buy one! Again, great service. The only slight niggle was that robes and slippers had to be requested, they weren't in the rooms on arrival. Whilst the slippers were the standard ones that you get in 5 star hotels, the robes felt a little cheap and one of mine, in particular, had a large hole in it. This is really a minor complaint though. We had a wonderful stay at the Fitzwilliam and cannot wait to return!",5,2012,07,31
226,"Location is good, but the little things let it down.","We booked a 1 night stay with groupon inc breakfast for ¬£99. If u spend over ¬£60 in the restaurant u get a bottle of wine free. However, closer to the time they r offering better offers on there own site, inc the free wine. We stayed here before and couldn't complain. This time r room was a lot smaller, assuming because it was a groupon booking. We would have liked breakfast in the room but wud hav had nowhere to eat it as there wasnt a table. One of the cups in the room had a stained crack and had to phone for extra towels as they had only left 2. I know this is being v picky but we had such a good experience the last time that we were a bit disappointed. Wudnt book with an offer again.",3,2012,07,31
226,Fantastic Hotel,"Just back from a 1 night stay at the Fitzwilliam Hotel. Loved every second of my stay. Check-in was efficient and friendly. Room was fantastic, (we were upgraded to a Suite WOW) spacious, clean and well equipped and the view from the huge floor to ceiling window was amazing. The bed was extremely comfy and I had the best nights sleep I have ever had in a Hotel.
They have a fantastic cocktail list in the bar and, along with the excellent ambient lighting and helpful staff, we were able to escape for a few hours.
We had breakfast in the restaurant - all the food was fresh - and the cooked breakfast was excellent (and served on a warm plate) and once again the staff were brilliant.
This Hotel looks fantastic and thanks to wonderful staff and attention to detail is FANTASTIC.",5,2012,07,31
226,Thank You... A Most Memorable Stay,"I just wanted to drop you a quick review to thank The Fitzwilliam Team for a most memorable stay last weekend.  My boys were beyond excited staying in a FIVE star hotel for the weekend and their expectations were certainly met by your hotel.  A special shout out to Gerard and Kris who are always stand out ""stars"" when I stay with you.  Again many thanks, keep up the great work and I very much look forward to staying with you guys again in the future.",5,2012,07,30
226,Who let the thugs out?,"Whilst this is a nice modern hotel, our stay was ruined by the thuggish behaviour of the Concierge. Returning back to the hotel at 2.30 am, hotel residents were required to queue at the glass door to gain entry. I waited for 2 minutes whilst the Concierge shot me intimidating glances. When he eventually troubled himself to open the door, I was required to produce my room card, name and room number before being allowed in. Other members of our party were not so fortunate, having been denied admission and forced to wait outside, whilst others were marched to their rooms and told to find ID. At all times this mans conduct was thuggish, aggressive and menacing. At no time did he give the impression he was here to help us.

Things got worse when we were later told the Bar was closing and we should move to the lobby area. The Concierge first opened the doors to let a draft in and when this didn't work told us we told were no longer welcome in the Hotel and that if we didn't go to bed, the he would throw us onto the street. 

This mans conduct was astonishing and ruined the stay of a civilised and well behaved group of people. Before booking the Fitzwilliam, please consider whether you might want to return to the Hotel after midnight and whether you really want to stay at a Hotel that feels the need to handpick Belfasts most unsavoury nightclub doorman to employ as a Concierge.",1,2012,07,29
226,Putting on the Fitz!!!,"We stayed in the Fitzwilliam for a weekend city break (Fri 20/07/12 - Mon 23/07/12). The location was ideal, right in the centre of Belfast though you wouldn't know it once you got to your room. The hotel is next door to the Grand Opera House and just a short walk to numerous restaurants, bars, shops etc. The hotel is about five minutes walk from the bus station and the bus to Belfast Int'l airport takes about 45 mins. We booked a couple of tours with Odessey Tours (Jim is the man to speak to) they were very accommodating by picking us up from our hotel as part of the service - second to none. Again great location to be.

We arrived early but were able to store our luggage by the concierge til our rooms were ready. When we did get into our rooms - wow. Very often you see pictures of hotels on websites and they look good, but when you get there, you're a bit disappointed. Not so at the Fitzwilliam. The rooms were of a good size and very clean. The beds were a pleasure to sleep in - I almost couldn't wait to get in from our trips to enjoy the comfort! The staff were very accommodating - nothing ever seemed to be a problem for them, from making recommendations on places to visit to ensuring everything was to our satisfaction. I can't fault them at all. The only thing we didn't do was try the spa facilities - we were too busy out.

Overall, it's a great place to stay - I would recommend you book early to get a good deal. I would definitely stay there again if I visit Belfast again.",4,2012,07,29
226,"On the fence about this hotel, great staff let down by poor training","Were do I start, when making the reservation i requested a double room away from the elevators, and called the hotel to make sure this was ok, On checkin i had to wait for the room which is fair as i was early' however i then reconfirmed Double away from elevator
So they took my phone num and said would call me when ready, an hour and a half shoping later i went back to the hotel, the room had been ready a while yet i got no call, I went to the room and cou,d not belive it was a twin 507 right next to the elevator. I called down and was told towait in room and concierge would come with a new key to move me, 15 minutes later i just went down, nothing done and had to wait another ten mins in reception. Got in the lift' this is 2.30pm and there is a half empty wine glass sitting the corner and the carpet neede hovered badly

The bedrooms are very good, great size and with fantastic lighting the tv is perched precariously on a small shelf and they never put the movies on despite my call, so i gave up and there are very ltd tv channels about 20 only, the room was very clean. I loved the bathrooms and the candle and match's were a nice touch, great two man bath aand walk shower and again great lighting ,cheap OR old towels though, The bed and pillows are so comfy I had a great sleep, so that is a major major plus

I went out for a late night coming back to be then greeted by three bouncers checking my details, not pleasant and not done in any other hotel i have ever stayed in.

Ok let me say here that all the staff are very friendly and helpfull in the Fitzwilliam, but they do seem to lack training

Breakfast then, I waited the door wait to be seted sign for about 10 minutes without any aknowledgement from staff, but the guy was very nice and appologised for the delay when i was eventually seated and it was very busy to be fair. Breakfast is buffet continental with cooked served to table. VERY underwhelming, palad cheap bacon slice,cheap sausauge,burnt potato bread, the orange juice was cheap, the glass,s were hot. The continental was ok nothing major.

Again the staff were so nice though so it was pity",3,2012,07,29
226,Good hotel in the centre of town,"Had been to S ireland and wanted a stopover in belfast before heading home. Central location and had everything we could ask for. Took advantage of the pillow selection and was glad as the selection was more comfortable than the ones provided. Lovely big shower, but the floor was very slippery and another grab handle for coming out would be good. A word of caution if you are visiting the Titanic exhibition, if you do not book in advance there is a long wait.",4,2012,07,29
226,Avoid Room 214!,Unless you happen to be a family you should request another room. Our night away was completely ruined by the television noise that leaked into this room from room 216 through a poorly constructed interconnecting door. It didn't help that our fellow guest ran the TV all night until 5am and then obviously short of his TV fix tuned it in again at 7:15am. Additionally this a standard room set up for disabled guests so the bathroom doesn't have a bath and feels like a public shower room at your local gym.,2,2012,07,29
226,Only at the Fitz!,"My family and I went to the Fitzwilliam for afternoon tea. Excellent value for money, delicious tasty little treats and impeccable service. Staff were very attentive and we were made to feel special from the moment we walked through the door. Outstanding hotel. Currently finding an excuse to return!",5,2012,07,27
226,nice hotel,"we stayed here for a night in early july and found it an enjoyable experience,we arrived about nine thirty am and our room was ready,we didnt think we would get access to the room at that time so a nice touch,we had booked a suite on the eighth floor which was expensive but well worth the extra,a well set out and presented room with lovely views over belfast to the hills,we ate in the restaurant at night but we did not think the food was up to the standards the hotel claimed but we had two three course meals with wine for fifty five pounds which we thought was excellent value,The staff were very helpful whenever you needed any help or advice about anything and are a great advert for this hotel,With its central position We shall certainly return when ever in belfast",4,2012,07,27
226,Great Hotel very friendly and helpful staff and fantastic breakfasts,"We stayed at this hotel 21/7/12 to 24/7/12.  The hotel is in a great location.  Beside the train/bus station so easiy to get from and to the Airport.  Also very easy to get around Belfast. The reason for the visit to Belfast was to visit the Titanic Experience.  

The room was lovely and a really good size and the bed was soooooo comfortable.  We went to the hotel restaurant on the Saturday night, it was ok.  Food flattered to decieve.  I ordered steak and Pepper cream, steak was nice but could have been seasoned better to bring out taste as the ""pepper cream"" was limited!  However the cooked breakfast was the best I have ever had.  Such great quality and taste.  I dont as a rule like fried food but this was  DELICIOUS!!!  Well done to the chef.  We had a bit of a ""lost in translation"" each day as i ordered the food as there is a selection; glaswegian is hard to follow.  But we got there in the end.  

The front of house staff were very friendly and helpful.  Any requests were met with a smile and  the issue sorted for example we did not have an option to buy film on our TV.  However once this was highlighted to the staff it was sorted.  The Concierge were great.  Very helpful and charming.  If we were going to visit Belfast again this would be our hotel of choice.  Fantastic.",4,2012,07,25
226,Lovely modern hotel,"My partner and I stayed here early july. Our room was really nice. It had mini bar, for which there was a charge, a safe, digital radio, tea/coffee making facilities etc. The bathroom had anti mist shaving mirror and a wonderful shower. We didnt eat here in the evening so cannot comment on the food although breakfast was really nice and the dining room where it was served was beautifully decorated. The bar had an extensive cocktail list. the hotel is within walking distance of the city centre shops, bars and restaurants and next to the bus station. Parking is across the street, hotel charge ¬£17 to valet park your car, we did it ourselves and it was around ¬£10.",5,2012,07,24
226,Stylish hotel in a great location,We stayed at this hotel with our 2 kids when visiting the Titanic Museum.  We had adjoining rooms and just loved the whole feel of the place.  Beds were extremely comfortable but our room was a bit warm while the kids air-conditioning was a bit loud - not loud enough to bother the kids though.  Decor is very up-to-the-minute with luxe finishes.  I had a delicious meal at the restaurant - best of our whole trip. Would highly recommend this hotel as it was also very reasonably priced.,4,2012,07,20
226,"Great location, clean and spacious rooms.","Overall very good. Staff were great. The service in the restaurant left a bit to be desired and some details show the signs of cost cutting, like the tiny thin bathrobes. 
But all in all a pleasant stay.",4,2012,07,19
226,Poor nights sleep,"Stayed here overnight for myself & my boyfriend's anniversary. Everything about this hotel is excellent, got the room for a bargain ¬£80, however when it reached 2am and I was trying to get to sleep I just couldn't. The bed was the most uncomfortable thing ever and the mattress was far too hard for me, I tossed and turned all night and had an aching back as a result. Got about 2 hours of fitful sleep and boyfriend didn't sleep well either. Weird thudding noise from pipes or something in the walls all throughout the night too. Based on the fact that you'll only ever need a hotel as somewhere to sleep - avoid the fitzwilliam. unless you like really firm mattresses..",3,2012,07,15
226,Great Hotel & Location.....but just not good enough.,"Stayed here in June after seeing a play about the Titanic in the Mac Theatre.
I had booked in with another couple in 2 suites.
On checking in, my wife's jacket was stolen. this either happened in reception after the bags were taken from the car, or from the room. 
The hotel went to check and we had to chase them up to see if it was found. There was no CCTV footage to help.
Also we had to ask two times for the mini bar in the room to be opened from reception as its locked from there. I still wasnt opened and I didnt ask a third time.
The room was a suite on the 8th floor and whilst the rooms were very nice, the stolen jacket issue dampened the stay.
I has stayed at this hotel before (their records will show this), taking suites each time and its usually fine, but this issue means I will be hesitant to rebook.

226,If you want nasal problems go here,"Very disappointed in this hotel considering it is a 5 star the room itself was nicely decorated but the rooms temperature was terrible and we stayed in colder months you couldn't breath no windows to open so it was so sticky especially after a bath, we woke up in the morning had a terrible nights sleep our tongues were stuck to the top of our mouths and when we asked for water they gave us it in a silver jug that smelt like something from school!! And it was warm!!!
They completely messed up our breakfast order no sauces no milk for tea or coffee and warm orange juice.
We didn't eat just drank and the cocktails took forever to make 15/20 minutes if someone offered me this for half price I,d not even stay again we had he nasal congestion for two days after,
Also walls paper thin and you could here everything maybe we got a dodgy room but I doubt it get it sorted !!!!!
I've stayed in 3 star hotels that are far nicer don't waste your money.",2,2012,07,15
226,Overnight in Belfast,Stayed bed and breakfast on an overnight. the location of the hotel is ideal for centre of the city with only short walks to mostly any shops and malls. Only a couple of hundred yards around the corner from the europa bus station.,5,2012,07,15
226,Needs attention..,"Stayed for 1 night with a wedding party. Mix up in the room bookings, but this was not the fault of the hotel. We needed two twins and two doubles, but ended up with all doubles. Rather than move rooms after checking in, we just asked the reception for some separate bedding. This request was never fulfilled.
Rooms are clean and of a generous size. Iron and board in our room which you don't often come accross. Proper hairdryer instead of a wall mounted one. Aircon worked well. Very comfortable bed.Choice of pillows noted in the welcome book. Chipped mosaic tiles in the bathroom which need replacing. Nice walk in shower + bath . Candle on the bathtub for those romantics amongst us. Complimentary toiletries- if you are going to use refillable soap/shampoo bottles, they should at least be cleaned of the previous guests residue !
The bar: We waited 40 minutes for a selection of drinks.The bar was reasonably busy, but the intensely annoying part was watching 3 or 4 other couples entering the bar and being served drinks before we received our order. A complaint to the bar manager was both fruitless and without any apology. Bungled orders followed and one waiter returned 3 times to confirm. We did however, receive one free cocktail, but the waiter informed us it was made by mistake so it was complimentary. Still no apology. The Guinness served was poor to say the least.
Breakfast was average and certainly not the standard or variety you would expect for a 4 star (apparently pushing for a fifth star). Hand dryer not working in the restaurant toilet, but when the waiter was informed, he told us the maintenance team knew about it the night before. If the hand dryer in the toilet is broken and everyone knows about it, you would think they would at least put some paper hand towels in temporarily.
Spoke with the duty manager on the morning of checkout regarding some of the above issues and received an apology.We suggested the 2 cooked breakfast charges were removed from the bride and grooms bill which was duly honoured. Reception staff were pleasant and helpful-shame the separate sheets request wasn't followed up.",3,2012,07,15
226,Got on discount website,"Its never a good sign when a 5 star is on a discount website. The property was nice, food at bar was excellent. Bar tender was nice guy. Front desk staff was a bit pretentious. Rooms were nice and suited just fine. If it is discounted; stay here!",3,2012,07,14
226,nice hotel but not 5 star!,"Nice hotel, ¬£17 to park which was crazy! Nice double room with lighting that flickered the whole time we were there! Asked for bath robes which we did not get for 4 hours later and at that stage we were on our way out! Good sleep but no way a 5 star",3,2012,07,14
226,Can't wait to go back,"Love this place. Perfect location, great staff, and I'm going back next week can't wait.",5,2012,07,12
226,Pretty good!,We only slept in this hotel - no meals.  Valet parking at ¬£17 (to give someone else the privilege of driving your pride and joy) would probably prevent me from returning.  It would be useful if the address included next to the Opera House or the name of the side road which the hotel actually fronts on to.,4,2012,07,11
226,Will be first choice for next trip!,"A friend booked accommodation for this trip and chose the fitzwilliam- a hotel I had never heard of. 
I was blown away by the helpful concierge- they went above and beyond the call of duty with their care and attention to any request or question we had. The rooms were amazing- stylish, clean and with everything we needed. Great views to the hills too. 
Breakfast was great- poached eggs cooked to perfection - I could not have asked for more. 
Def will be back to this hotel!",5,2012,07,09
226,Stay in Belfast-fitzwilliam,"As an ex pat I knew my way around Belfast.  Location is great close to EVERYTHING bus terminal for flights out of Dublin is a three minute walk away. 
I loved having a bath in the soaking stand alOne tub. 
FitzwilliamI is a classy fine hotel I will be staying there next time upon my return home. 
I booked through Expedia, Expedia offered hotel w free Internet and option for breakfast. I suggest paying for the breakfast. 12$ Canadian vs 16 pound at hotel. 
Have fun, trust me it's a great hotel.",4,2012,07,08
226,great atmosphere,"my mother and I stayed in the fitzwilliam in early June for the weekend. On arrival we were checked in quickly by the two lovely receptionists. It was great as our bags were dropped up to our room and we were able to head out to the shops, all of which were on our doorstep. Later we came back and relaxed by the fire with drinks from the bar. The following morning breakfast was great, we were served by Lauren and then Chris in the evening time. Both were so attentive and really looked after us well. Our evening meal was great, I would highly recommend the lamb..cooked to perfection. We had such a fab weekend and cant wait to return!",5,2012,07,03
226,The Staff Makes It Superior,"This hotel is trendy; very nice. It's the friendly staff that really makes it someplace special. We booked a suite and it was very nice with a great shower! The front desk staff & concierge (especially Declan) went out of their way to help us with directions, our luggage & extra room keys. Our room had a great view, and the included breakfast was excellent. The service is quick & the people are really nice.",5,2012,07,02
226,"Very, very average","I paid 350 pounds for a two night stay and feel very short-changed.
This is the first trip advisor review I have ever posted but the hotel is so average that I had to write about it. The room was fine but there were no robes or slippers as advertised in the information booklet. I rang reception to order some and had to call again two hours later because they never came. The tv only had a few stations and was hard to use and there was no pen with the writing paper. Little things like this make a difference, especially in a five star hotel. It was the bar and restaurant that really drove me mad. We had to queue ten minutes for breakfast the first morning and were not even approached by any staff member to apologize or tell us they were busy. We ordered poached eggs which came out on a plate with no garnish and obviously had been re-heated because they were so overdone. The staff were very poor and you were expected to make your own toast in an area with no plates. So you had to walk to your table with your toast in your hand. Hardly a five star feature. We ate in the hotel and had to wait fifteen minutes for a pint because it had to come from the downstairs bar. When we ordered wine it was kept in an ice bucket three tables away eventhough nobody was in the place. Instead of the staff automatically topping you up we had to keep asking in between courses. We ordered chowder and when we weren't given a spoon and asked the girl who brought it, the look of panic on her face. She asked a colleague for one instead of getting it herself which took about five minutes. Staff obviously have specific functions (one took drink order, another food, another delivered it etc), and when they are asked for something outside of this they panic. I could go on and on. I stayed here three years ago and loved it. It has gone unbelievably downhill since then. I jaw stayed in five star hotels around the world but this was one of my worst-ever experiences. I will not be back.",2,2012,07,01
226,Excellent service in a great hotel. Well worth a visit,"Belfast is well worth a visit. Everyone is so friendly and nothing is too much trouble. This hotel is centrally located and great for shops and all the sites. If you're coming to see the Titantic exhibition, booking is a must. Great weekend in a great and friendly city. Highly recommended.",5,2012,06,30
226,"Large rooms, well located","We were able to walk to the hotel from the train station and found it central to all we needed in Belfast. The rooms are good size, very modern with good facilities like stereo & tea/coffee...it's possible your view will be of another wall.   We did find the rooms extremely warm and while the bathroom was huge, the shower was very hazardous, the surface of the floor extremely slippery  - a few grip strips on the bottom needed.   
The staff were friendly, concierge helpful with taxis.  Breakfast was ok.  It was very busy and they kept running out of bowls, juice, bread  causing an impatient queue of people building up around the buffet. The breakfast room is all orange & bright lights, while the rooms are black, white & green...all very modern but not to everyone's taste.  Our stay was fine...I would stay again but would easily consider an alternative too as I have the feeling there might be more unique options out there.",4,2012,06,28
226,Brilliant Service,"On a Hen party in belfast. We did not stay in the Fitzwilliam but spent the evening there. 
From booking I had dealt with both Stephanie & Charlene in Sales and they were always so helpful and made the booking very easy and it was never a problem to amend the reservations.
The hotel itself has fabulous decor and a welcoming reception.  We were met in reception with the biggest smile by Johnny who was to be our host for the evening for our cocktail masterclass.
We were brought to the 9th floor, where we had our intimate room for the evening with a fabulous view of Belfast.
Johnny was a fantastic host!Welcoming, Personal, Knowledgable & Professional. We had such a fabulous time,great fun and of course learned a little cocktail making!!
We also had Canapes & a Four course Meal in the hotel that evening and all of the twelve girls agreed that the food & service was brilliant.
10/10 all round.",5,2012,06,28
226,Enjoyed every minute,"My friends and i stayed here and it exceeded our expections. Our boutique room was quirky, comfy and relaxing.Modern and spacious. The hotel had a clean fresh feeling. We attended cocktail making classes in the bar which was a great laugh. We experienced a keycard problem which was very efficently dealt with an apologies given. Had a great nights sleep in a comfortable bed, no noise problems. Breakfast the next day was suberb also. Location convenient to shopping , shows, pubs and resturants.",5,2012,06,27
226,"Average, nothing more","Although this is listed as a five star hotel, it didn't seem to be anything above a three.  We stayed for two nights.  Room was clean with large bathroom and comfortable bed.  Modern decor.  Free wifi.  On second night of a two night stay, the keycard to the room was shut down preventing us to access our room - mistake by the person checking us in but rather a hastle to have to trek down to the lobby in the middle of the night to gain access to the room.",3,2012,06,26
226,avoid!!!!,"Stayed for one night after my sister's wedding. Afraid we'll never be back! Staff were rude and unhelpful. Initially reception told my sister they didn't have a reservation for her even though her luggage had been left in that morning. Mother of the bride was left in tears after being told she didn't have a reservation either. Bar staff rudely informed us he was closing the bar, even though we were residents, because he was working again the next morning! The hotel emailed me to ask my view of my stay. I did email the manager, however, I never received a reply. Plenty of other good hotels in Belfast, anywhere rather than Fitzwilliam! Certainly not what I have come to expect from an apparently 4 star hotel.",1,2012,06,25
226,Not expensive for the quality provided,"Excellent hotel in a great location.
Staff were very helpful 
Superb rooms with very comfortable beds 
Not expensive for the quality provided",5,2012,06,25
226,Modern hotel. Good location,"Stayed in this hotel for 3 nights. Chose this hotel due to its location. Also we thought it was a good idea to try a modern hotel for a change.
We arrived at  the hotel in a rental car and it took us 3 rounds to find the right approach to the hotel entrance as it was not very well marked.
The decor is modern. The lobby has a lounge area that has a fire place with fire going  which gives it a homely feel. 
Once we were in the  hotel corridors to our room, we found the lightings were quite dim. That inadequate lighting extended even to the bathroom in our room.
I found the geometric pattern and the bold yellow colour coordination in the room worked well. We had a delightful room partly because of that visual feel. The room is roomy with a sofa to sit on. The TV displayed a message to welcome us which was a nice touch.
Our rate included breakfast. The breakfast room has very modern and well designed tables and chairs. The selection of food was not extensive but was adequate.
On the second day of our stay, a baby cot appeared mysteriously in our room. We rang the front desk to collect it but it was not actioned. As the room was big enough, we just left it there. We had a good chuckle over this unexpected item in our room.
The front desk staff are very friendly. The concierge was very helpful in directions and suggestions.
This hotel is right next to the Opera House and is central to everything. 
We would be happy to return to stay at this hotel again..",4,2012,06,25
226,A 3 star hotel at best,"This is a 3 star hotel at best. Why it's classed as a 5 star, I don't know. No pool. A dusty bedroom. Used tissues in a tissue box. Minimal staff. There are better cheaper hotels in Belfast. Big room and nice enough bathroom, free wifi too. But, No flannel, or herbal tea, hot chocolate and no complementary biscuits. These might seem trivial criticisms but it's classed as a 5 star hotel. ",3,2012,06,25
226,Lovely and modern,Stayed for one night. Hotel lovely modern and very comfortable. A little bit overpriced though even though it is a nice play to stay but was 130pnd for the night. Did not try the restaurant so cannot comment. Also I left something behind and when I rang hotel they said nothing was found so i take it the maids took it home with them! Which ws a let down but all in all a nice night away.,4,2012,06,24
226,Excellent hotel,"We stayed only one night unfortunately. This is a beautiful hotel and the bar is fabulous. Great food and drinks. Stylish, great location and friendly staff. Would definitely recommend.",5,2012,06,23
226,Quick Bar Lunch pre Theatre,"My Wife and I popped in here for a Bar Lunch before the Matinee at GOH,next door and were looked after by a delightful young lady from Venezuela.
The service was good and our lunch just what we needed to fill the gap till Dinner.We had soup,sandwich and thick chips followed by coffee.Nice quiet atmosphere.We will call again",4,2012,06,16
226,Just lacking something extra,"I booked this hotel from Australia as I was travelling to be at a conference and to spend time with my Irish partner. We stayed here for 7 nights and had mixed experiences. Some days service was great others not so. We had ordered drinks to our room before we headed out, we were told that the tray charge was 10 pound considering our drinks came to 9.50 it didn't quite sit right with us, I questioned this charge another night when I ordered dinner and wasn't charged so I think it depends on who is on that day/night.
The room was ""ok"" but nothing that the description from the hotel website had described, oh and by the way watch out for the shower floor incredibly slippery and quite dangerous, I suggested to management that these surfaces need to be changed, being a health care provider I could see some really nasty accidents that could happen!
This hotel is also quite expensive I believe for belfast, to compare Im Australian and could stay in a 5* hotel in Sydney or Melbourne for 3/4 of the price I paid here, but look I have to say the concierge were fabulous, always smiling and very helpful and at the end of the day, it was the people of Belfast that made my trip an experience not a hotel",3,2012,06,15
226,our stay,"On arrival we where warmly greeted and throughout our stay it was like this all through the hotel my only complaint would be that although our room was lovely we could not get any sleep due to the heat in the room, we had air con on then opened windows but nothing worked. Other than that a warm friendly hotel.",3,2012,06,10
226,An excellent hotel,"My wife and I stayed at this hotel in early June, and really enjoyed our stay.

Good points
- very stylish room with big bathroom
- great location with plenty of restaurants nearby
- lovely cocktail bar in hotel
- large comfortable bed, air conditioning, 'black out' curtains

Bad points
- Tea and coffee facilities a little tight. No biscuits or bottled water included!
- our room key needed to be reset every day, which became a little tedious
- staff sometimes a little slow, though it was a busy weekend over the jubilee bank holiday

I would definitely return, and think the hotel was good value for money. I would be happy to recommend the Fitzwilliam to family and friends.",4,2012,06,09
226,Super!! Check your bill though.,"We recently stayed for 5 days here. Fabulous room, great service, wonderful friendly staff. Good food. Very comfortable indeed. 2 negatives though - the standard ¬£10 charge for room service is a nerve, and this disincentive must be losing the hotel a fortune! We just bought sandwiches at the local Tesco instead! Also when you check out, your bill will be automatically debited with a pound sponsoring some obscure deep African eye-care charity!! I don't like others spending my money without at least asking me!",5,2012,06,08
226,WOW WOW WOW,"The photos' that have been posted don't do this lovely hotel any justice AT ALL...reality is much better than the photos

 In typical Irish form, we were greeted warmly when we arrived, check-in quickly and our room was ready despite our being 5 hours early.

The room was amazing, and that was just the Executive Superior..wonder how long i'd have to save to stay in the Penthouse!!

I LOVE a bathroom and was seriously impressed with the size of it.

The Hotel is in the perfect part of the City and everywhere is just 10 minutes away

My husband and I had our evening meal in the restaurant which was amazing - service could do withi a little TWEAKING but overall the attention we received was friendly and warm.

My only gripe is having to pay for Breakfast - considering how much a room costs paying seems quite shocking

Would I stay there again ABSOLUTELY and i would recommend everyone did too",4,2012,06,06
226,Well worth a visit,"Myself and my husband took a trip to Belfast for our wedding anniversary and stayed in the Fitzwilliam. We could not have chosen a better venue - the staff were superb, particularly the manager Cian, who went out of his way to welcome us and make sure we enjoyed our anniversary celebrations. The location of the hotel was excellent, within walking distance of the city centre, and our room was very modern, bright and airy. We dined in the hotel restaurant on the second night - the food was excellent, and as a surprise the staff brought out a dessert slate with Happy Anniversary written on it in chocolate icing! Overall a wonderful hotel, with warm staff and great amenities. Well worth a visit.",5,2012,06,04
226,utter luxury,"Stayed here for three nights in february. on arrival we were met by valet who collected and parked our car (still to this day have no idea where the car was for the duration of our stay) we were assisted with out luggage, staff where very friendly helpful and full of information. We arrived to our room and it was amazing!! beautifully and modernly designed with everything you could need i.e dressgown slippers toiletries mini bar music system. it had it all and then some. on our final night we sampled some of the bars cocktails which are a must, they take a little while to make but worth it and we ate at the bar also, the food was fab! could not fault this hotel on anything. booked it for a reasonable price considering the luxury we got and this was through booking.com! We plan to return again soon.",5,2012,06,01
226,not quite 5 star,"Stayed for one night weekend late june 2012 overall the staff were very good as is the location of the hotel Most of my concerns although they may seem trivial revolve around what makes a good hotel , very good things like no complimentary water in the room, dressing gowns having to be ordered from recption ,tea making facilities pretty basic, room decor showing signs of wear ,problems with the door keys etc.The breakfast fruit and breads had no tongs so some people simply used their hands to lift them,also the buffet choice was not very extensive",3,2012,05,28
226,"Perfect location, amazing staff, absolutely brilliant.","We got a great deal for our 2 nights stay from Booking.com and were not disappointed. We've stayed at hotels in the city in the past but this was by far the best.

We called ahead and reserved a parking space. The valet collects your car from outside the hotel and parks it for you after bringing your bags into the lobby and up to your room. Check in took less than 3 minutes and the staff were attentive and friendly. 

The public areas of the hotel are well furnished, chic and modern. We didn't use the bar or restaurant, but both looked lovely. The former had a selection of cosy looking booths.

Our room was large and bright with views of the mountains. We had called ahead and asked for a bucket of ice, which was waiting for us in the room. The bathroom is spacious with one huge mirror covering one wall. The shower and bath are separate, the former is huge with a rain shower head. One excellent little touch which I've never seen in any hotel, ever, was a candle and some matches next to the bath.

There was oodles of storage and a huge sofa in the room too. For the bog standard ""Executive"" room, this was a great addition. There was also a well stocked minibar - which we didn't use - but we did use the selection of wine glasses (both red and wine) and tumblers that were provided as standard in the cupboard. Similarly, we called down for buckets of ice several times and they arrived within minutes.

Overall I would recommend this hotel 100% to everyone. Philip the concierge we dealt with via mail, phone and throughout our stay was professional, attentive and friendly.",5,2012,05,28
226,Enjoyable stay,We stayed for 2 nights in mid May and have a lovely break that was incredibly good value.  (Check out the Sunday night prices on the website.)  All the staff were very helpful. Our only criticism is that breakfast was disappointing - there was a poor choice on the buffet and indifferent quality compared to the high standard of everything else.  We didnt eat there in the evening because of this so cant review dinner.  In any case it didnt impact on our enjoyment and we'll definitely return.,4,2012,05,27
226,Great hotel in good location,"Stayed for one night in a Superior Twin room. Room was spacious and comfortable and the staff was friendly. Breakfast was included in the hotel stay. Hot breakfast was not expensive if you want something more substantial than croissant/cereal/etc. The hotel is a few doors across from The Crown Bar which was convenient after a daylong Giants Causeway tour. There is a Spar convenience store and a Tesco supermarket across the hotel. If you don't want to pay Europa Hotel's prices, stay here. We took a bus from Dublin to Belfast and the bus station is less than a 5 minute walk around the corner. Very convenient. They have an arrangement with McComb's Executive Travel and Day Tour so McComb's picked us up from our hotel for the Giants Causeway tour.",5,2012,05,26
226,The place to stay in Belfast,"From the moment of arrival until our departure we found every member of staff to be welcoming, friendly and efficient. The decor of the hotel and rooms were of a very high standard as was the breakfast buffet. In fact, the entire package would leave you quite happy to spend the entirety of your stay in Belfast within the hotel itself. Although, when you do want to see the sights, the staff are expert guides to suggest the best parts of the city. 

In short, in this reviewers experience the Fitzwilliam Belfast has set the new standard of quality and service which I have no doubt it will only continue to improve upon, no matter how difficult a task that will be",5,2012,05,24
226,very friendly staff,My daughter and I stayed in the hotel for 3 nights.Rooms are very spacious and comfortable.The hotel is in a great location .Everyone from the reception to concierge were very helpful and friendly .Restaurant food was delicious and service great . will stay here again on my next visit,5,2012,05,24
226,Wonderful concierge services,"We stayed in the hotel for a long weekend of 3 nights.
Rooms are comfortable and nicely decorated.
But what stood out were the concierge services, in booking restaurants, parking our car, handling luggage etc.",4,2012,05,23
226,second visit.,"This was my second visit to the lovely Fitzwilliam Hotel. This time with my hubby and friends. The Hotel is modern and sophisticated. The rooms are decorated in modern furnishings with a great colour scheme of yellow with Black/white. very chic. Beds are a bit hard but I did not notice the ""pillow menu"" until we were due to go home! The bar area is very relaxed with background music and lots of candles. Great choice of drinks. Very central, close to shops and attractions. Great hotel, we got a great price online too. I will certainly stay there again.",5,2012,05,19
226,Standards have nosedived - disappointing.,"On the face of it the Fitzwilliam Hotel, Belfast, is a nice hotel. Its located in the city centre on Great Victoria Street and has a entrance, reception and bar area. Unfortunately this is where the good points end... I recently stayed here for 7 nights with my australian partner and would like to inform you of our experiences.

This hotel is located on a corner of a busy street, getting into and out of a taxi outside this hotel, on one of belfast's busy roads is not a pleasant experience. 

Service in the hotel is adequate at best. Trying to get served food or drinks at the bar lasts a lifetime. When one of the guys serves you, their attitude is one of disinterest - some even have their shirts hanging down over their trousers, hardly a good look for an alleged 'good hotel'. In one instance, I asked to order a bottle of still water from a guy (gregorz, i think his name was), but he informed me that they had run out of still water. When I went to try to pay my bill, I stood for 15 minutes at the bar until an employee served me. 

The next evening, I wanted to make a drinks order from my room... the two drinks came to ¬£9.50, BUT the charge for delivering the drinks was ¬£10.... (when I queried this at reception, I was told that this was set by the General Manager, and that it was hotel policy.... fair enough, but I would suggest you look into this charge as its a bit of a joke!) You are a small hotel, the journey from bar to room lasts 2 minutes at best. Remember, your customer should always come first - we should not be taken advantage of.

Breakfasts at this place are mediocre - the food is dry and the service is again, slow.

Dinner in the restaurant was 'ok'. Pity they dont sell much local produce... I asked where the salmon came from and the reply was 'Sri Lanka'.... LAUGH OUT LOUD - Ireland has the finest salmon in the world.

I could go on... (clean your lifts - they are very dirty).

I liked this place when it first opened. We moved to the Europa on day 8 - and it was a better experience. 

Guys, improve your services. My stay was not a good one, due to slipping standards.",3,2012,05,19
226,great city centre location,"this hotel has a fantastic location for touring belfast or for a great city break.  On arrival the concierge was lovely and helpful and the receptionist was polite, well mannered and again helpful.  The guinness is delicious in the bar lol (according to my husband) so that was a good starter. I do not think this hotel should be a 5* i would say 3*+/4*. It is very expensive really overpriced but the decor and ambience is great. I would stay here again and do reccommend it to couples or to a group of friends but definitely not children as there is no facilities for them.",4,2012,05,17
226,Good Irish hospitality,"Stayed for a night last week, great location, had breakfast , lunch and dinner in the hotel. The food was perfect and the service attentive. The bar is a little devoid of personality, relative to the surrounding pubs. The hotel is directly across from the Crown Pub. which is amazing. I would stay in the hotel again . Got a great deal on the rooms on onhotel. Less than 100 pounds per room bed and breakfast.",5,2012,05,15
226,Beautiful Hotel,I booked the Fitzwilliam on hotels.com and got a great deal. The hotel itself is fabulously decorated and our bed was so comfortable. The staff were very friendly and welcoming. Theres a lovely foyer which had a beautiful fire while we were there and it was lovely just to chill out and have a drink down there that evening. The hotel is very central and I woudl recommend it to anyone.,5,2012,05,12
226,"Great hotel, great location","We stayed in this hotel for one night only, but wished we could have extended our stay!  The hotel is situated about 3 minutes walk from the train / bus station on Victoria Street.  Perfect location.  When we arrived, our room wasn't ready, so we went off on an open top tour bus of Belfast City for the afternoon.  Reception said they would phone us when the room was ready, but they never did.  It didn't matter anyway, as we were off sightseeing, but it's just a good thing we weren't waiting!

We stayed in a fabulous superior king room.  Very spacious, lovely big corner window with a sofa in tucked into the window (perfect for sitting with a glass of wine!), huge bed, stereo, mini-bar and tea / coffee making facilities tucked away in a wardrobe. Very, very stylish.  Our bag was taken to our room but the concierge, Kris, who was really friendly and helpful - couldn't do enough for us. The room had air con / heating in it.  Get to grips with this before you attempt to sleep, as we were awake at 3 am kicking the covers off because it was too warm. Once we sorted this, it was much more comfortable, but either way, we were tired the next day.  The bathroom is quite big.  Consists of a bath and a huge separate shower.  I think some form of non-slip mat should be put in the showers, as I slipped a few times while I was in there.

Our intention was to have dinner in the hotel and then head out into Belfast for a few drinks, but upon reading the menu, we changed our plans! It didn't interest me at all. We ended up going to Chiquitos in the Victoria Mall - nicest Mexican restaurant I have ever been to!  

Breakfast was the full works. Usual contintental with hot food buffet.  There was pretty much anything we wanted.  Our waiter also advised that he could have something from the breakfast menu made for us, so we ordered omelette and poached eggs. The waiter, himself, was very attentive.  Made sure we were looked after with tea and coffee etc. 

When we were checking out, we were able to leave our bag with the concierge and go off into Belfast to the Titanic Museum.  A taxi was ordered for us and arrived quite quickly to bring us to our destination.  Again, we were dealing with Kris and he couldn't have been more helpful. 

One thing this hotel is lacking is leisure facilities.  A nice pool and spa area would fit in perfectly here and it's a shame there are none. It doesn't change the fact that the hotel is lovely and in a great location.",4,2012,05,11
226,Nice but not 5 star...,"Great location and very nice hotel, but like another reviewer there were small things that a 5 star hotel should do better. We were there at the weekend and there was no ketchup (just a bowl that had been scraped clean) available at breakfast and the waiter just shrugged when I asked was there any more. Now for a 5 star hotel and given that there is a Tesco right across the road, I'd have expected someone to be sent over to buy a few bottles, but the next morning there was still none. But no complaints about the breakfast itself - it was very good and the hot food was hot.

The bathroom looked great but there wasn't really space to keep a toiletries bag beside the sink.

I was also surprised at the size of the hotel - I wouldn't expect a boutique hotel to have 9 floors. But it was a nice break, the cocktail bar was great and the rain stayed away til Monday!",4,2012,05,10
226,Great hotel,"This hotel is excellent. The rooms are beautiful, with everything you could possibly need. The staff are very helpful and the quality and presentation of food of a high standard.
The location is central, whch precludes taking transport to the town centre.",5,2012,05,10
226,modern hotel great stay,"have stayed in the fitzwilliam a few times, great hotel within walking distance of bars and shops in belfast.  On one of our stays we were given a free upgrade from an executive room to a deluxe room that had a glass corner window looking out over the city, have also stayed in one of the suites on the higher floors, although the price is quite dear we have found that if you book direct with the hotel by phoning them they often give a good deal on a nights stay as well as evening meal and breakfast.  the bar is great for a few drinks or else sitting on till closing, can be hard to get a seat if down late. if you're not worried about spending alot or if you are to get away and not leave the room definiately a great stay",4,2012,05,09
226,Nice place and location,"Great hotel, stayed their twice ... very clean, free internet, and in a great location in Great Victoria .... Highly recommended",5,2012,05,09
226,Excellent Service & great location.,"I stayed in the hotel over the weekend and I have to say it was an amazing stay! The room was a lot nicer than I imagined it would be and the bathroom was huge. 

We decided to go for dinner and were served my a guy called Chris, he was a very pleasant and helpful waiter, he couldn't do enough for us, checked to make sure if everything was ok and made sure we had everything we wanted through the night. To finish our night we ordered a cheese board, it was lovely and it was presented and explained well by Amy. 

Our whole stay was brilliant and would definitely stay again A++ service!",5,2012,05,08
226,Good rooms good location but could do better,"This is a city centre Average 4* hotel front desk staff are very good can't do enough for you big rooms 
The bar is not really a family place at all and very pricey as is the restaurant, 
the reception area is nice 
big rooms 
breakfast was hard work ran out stuff they could not handle any crowd at all on the saturday where there was a total melt down at one point no glasses or eggs at all. 
There is better in Belfast and better value.",3,2012,05,07
226,disappointing,"The reviews we read were generally excellent. We arrived early due to morning flight so didn't expect the room to be ready Only when we got to our room later that day , unpacked and prepared for an evening out did we see just how 4 star this hotel was..
Water dribbled out of the bathroom sink tap...not great when shaving or brushing teeth.  No face cloths. No body lotions, no tissues,no bottle of water ( just one for ¬£3 in the fridge ), dirty table in the small lounge area, ripped duvet cover, carpet that was not vacuumed properly,,,,,just all a bit grubby and in need of some TLC.
These things may seem minor,,,and for a 3/4 star hotel costing under ¬£100 you might be right, but this is a '5 star luxury hotel'!! 
Ours was only a one night stay...leaving pre breakfast the following morning, so no chance to experience the food.....I assume that were we to have stayed another night , our complaints would have been addressed......
Good position in the city, but thats about it.",2,2012,05,06
226,Wonderful Titanic Festival Break!,"Me and my boyfriend stayed here for one night last week during the Titanic Festival. On arrival we were greeted by a friendly reception team who was only to happy to assist us with the many questions that we had. We arrived a bit early for check-in (2pm with a 12 noon check-out) which we felt was a little late, we had to wait some time for our room to be ready but it gave us some time to explore the city before settling down. 

We stayed in an executive double room on the 4th floor, which at first glance looked very grand and stylish, however on closer inspection had a few minor flaws. There was chipped paint on the skirting boards, and on the corners of the walls, with the odd small stain on the carpet - all minor things that could be taken care of with some TLC. The view it has to be said was awful, directly across the side of the Jury Inn, which really overlooked us (we could see people walking about in their rooms), to the side of this there was a very ugly carpark with road works infront of it. That said, the was room was clean, very comfortable and we certainly enjoyed our night their. 

Many people on here have commented about the dark corridors, which during the day were perfectly lit, however in the evening/nightime is was very dark and if I'm honest a little scary - luckily our room was right by the lift so we didn't far to go. 

Before dinner we had cocktails in the bar, which was very stylish but relaxed - loved it! There was a great selection, although a little pricey, and the waiters were very friendly and couldn't do enough for us. 

We ate dinner in the restaurant, which was a little quiet (we were the only people in there) but we had a fantastic evening never-the-less. The food was amazing and the staff very attentive without being overbearing. The only slight flaw (and it is slight) was the poor selection of 'old world' red wines, being a 5 star hotel I would expected more. The only downer of the evening was when we wanted to have a night-cap in the beautiful hotel lobby, which seemed to have been taken over by a large group of very loud women, who dressed in jeans and sports wear were not doing the hotel any favours at all.

We ate brealfast in the restaurant to, we had read several negative reviews about the breakfasts so we were unsure what to expect - we need not have worried. The breakfast was fantastic, a great choice of hot food and continental. It was self service for food, with table service for hot drinks - again the staff were very friendly and could not do enough for you. 

All-in-all it was a very enjoyable stay with only a few minor issues. To maintain its' 5 staff status and reputation The Fitzwilliam Hotel does have to be on the ball with the maintainance of the rooms and maybe supervise (lets just say) loud guests that might be comprimising other guests stays.",4,2012,04,27
226,"Comfort, Excellent Location, Great Values","Together with my wife and two close friends, we booked two rooms at the Fitzwilliam Hotel Belfast over the Easter holidays staying for two nights arriving on a Friday and leaving on Easter Sunday. We certainly didn't regret it. The staff was very friendly and helpful, 
The great thing about the Fitzwilliam is its excellent location.  It was only two blocks away from the City Hall where they had this excellent exhibit about the Titanic.  The Titanic was built in Belfast and being the 100th anniversary of the Titanic, it is such a big thing in Belfast this year. The hotel is just a block away from the Crown Bar, one of the most famous Irish pubs (and restaurant) in Belfast. It is only a couple of blocks away from the City Center where there is a lot of shopping and a lot of sights to see including the leaning tower of Belfast. 
We found the Fitzwilliam to be very modern and comfortable.  Considering it was the Easter weekend, we got a very good deal from the hotel. Really great value for money. We liked the fact that our room was quite spacious. It even had a very comfortable sofa in it.  The bathroom was modern and of good quality. One thing though, we found it strange that for a five star hotel, they only offered shampoo and body soap.  They didn't have any body lotion.
On our first night, being quite tired, we ordered from room service. We found it strange too that they were charging ten pounds for the service.  We thought this should really be part of the price and not an extra charge.  
Anyway, the gas fireplace at the lobby was a great comfort as it was raining strongly during that weekend in Northern Ireland.  On our last day, after winding down from all our walking tours and after checking out, we had quite a few hours to burn since our flight back to London wasn't till 9:30 in the evening. We just hung out at the lobby in the fireplace and chose some interesting coffee table books from their library in the lobby. All in all it was a really enjoyable stay at the Fitzwilliam.",5,2012,04,15
226,Delightful hotel,Stayed here for 2 nights at the beginning of April. What a lovely modern hotel. Comfortable and tasteful bedrooms which were spotless. Breakfast was good. Staff were very friendly. Very close to the waterfront hall etc. Only negative thing which has been highlighted before is the very dark corridors. Would go back again.,4,2012,04,14
226,Great find in the centre of Belfast,Beautiful boutique comfortable rooms.  Really tasty dinner of mainly local produce. Very convenient to shops and hop on hop off bus! Suitable for business travellers or tourists. I was proud to bring visitors here! ,5,2012,04,14
226,Lovely hotel,"Booked last minute & got a great deal for 1 night with b&b in a double room.

Bedroom was lovely, bed huuuuuuge, modern furnishings, bathroom similar. Shower looked like it would be a monsoon style experience - really wasn't.  Also complimentary toiletries were naff for a 5 star hotel.
Room was extremely warm during the night yet a/c very noisy.

Breakfast - selection of fruit/cereals/fried food. I'm not a lover of fried food so opted for toast & bacon. Bacon resembled cardboard!

I would stay at the hotel again but would not pay for breakfast - there are plenty of coffee shops 2 minutes away from the hotel.",4,2012,04,13
226,Not a patch on the merchant hotel!!,Myself and my husband have stayed in the fitzwilliam many times. We were there for valentines and for the first time noticed standards had slipped-we were v disappointed with the breakfast set up.....buffet now and used to all be table service which is really what should be provided in a five star hotel! We decided to take our 6 year old with us this time and rang the hotel before hand to enquire about an extra bed and which room would accommodate this best. We were advised to book a superior king room which is a little more expensive but were looking forward to seeing the room as we have always stayed in a king executive room. The room had 2 twin beds NOT a king size bed! The room we got was def not a superior room as it was no different to any other room we seen before! It did not have the Corner seating area as on website with floor to ceiling windows nor did it have an extra large bathroom!! We enquired at reception and were told it was a superior room despite us sayin we know it wasn't! And the staff were uninterested! The breakfast was pathetic!! No cooked breakfast available for nearly 15-20 mins-they had run out and said it was due to amount of people needing room service! This was at 8.30am!! This resulted in a lot of frustrated people queuing up for hot food....it was like a school canteen! This is def not a five star hotel any longer!! We were at a wedding here when the place opened and thought it was amazin....hence the many visits since.We have stayed in the merchant hotel recently and it was an unbelievable experience....a proper five star hotel. The management in the fitzwilliam should go over there to learn a few tips!! We'll not be back unless things improve!!,2,2012,04,11
226,A good hotel with a few minor flaws,"My wife and I stayed at this hotel for 4 nights from 2nd April. It has a good central location in Great Victoria Street. Our room on the 6th floor was a good size with a large bed and decent air conditioning. The double glazing to the windows does not keep out the sound of the traffic passing below. We had to report to reception that a rail in the bathroom shower was loose and that the metal chain strip on the entry door to the room had been screwwed on the wrong way -such criticism can be leveled at many hotels these days - the room attendants should be told to report such problems or management should carry out occasional checks on rooms.

The bath was quite deep and I found it difficult to get out given hand grips were not conveniently placed; other people, I accept, may have no problem.  

At the time of writing, the hotel's restaurant is listed in The Good Food Guide and in our opinion, at dinner, deservedly so. Breakfast was fine if, at times, a little difficult to convey what one wanted to the young serving staff; in truth the staff were always pleasant.

I would recommend this hotel albeit that it is  somewhat pricey. Is there any hotel without some imperfections?

What is true is that this hotel is the perfect place to start exploring the vibrant and yes attrractive  city of Belfast and other regions such as the Giants Causeway.  The people are friendly and times have thankfully changed. Go see it now!.  We really enjoyed our visit!selves",4,2012,04,09
226,Very Nice,"Decided last minute to head to Belfast for a night. Having stayed at Ten Square a few months back, we tried to get a room there but it was booked out so we went for the Fitzwilliam. Location great, quite central. The rooms in this hotel are very nice, spacious and extremely clean. Didn't have dinner in the hotel but had a few drinks in the bar.....good atmosphere and great cocktails. Def come back to this hotel when next staying in Belfast.",4,2012,04,08
226,Excellent Hotel,A really nice hotel near the centre of Belfast. A very chic bedroom with a fantastic bathroom. Free Wifi which is now the way it should be these days!,5,2012,04,05
226,Little bit of luxury in the heart of Belfast,"Booked this hotel as a bit of  atreat for my wife and myself. Got what seemed like a decent deal for a Sunday night stay, as this was a 5 star hotel. Hotel really has a gem of a location, right next door to the stunning Grand Opera House on the hustle and bustle of Great Victoria Street. Right across the street is the historic Crown Bar (a must for any visitor) and if you are there on a Sunday nigth as we were, there is a traditional Irish music session in Fibber Magee's next door.

As for the hotel itslef, well, it lived up to our expectations. I think its the first time we have ever stayed in a 5 star hotel, and the room really was something special. Lovely contemporary decor, huge comfy bed, and the bathroom was out of this world with trendy black tiles. Its a bit of a pity that more of the rooms dont look out onto Great Victoria Street itself as that is the best but the hotel has only a small frontage, and then stretches down the side street of Grovsner road which isnt as nice, and this is where the majority of the rooms look out onto. But views aside, the hotel was fabulous. Staff very friendly and efficient, lobby was very classy. In some hotels, all you hear all night long is dors banging etc, but in this hotel you would have thought you were the only one staying in it such was the wonderful peace and tranquility. Perfect",5,2012,04,02
226,"Would never stay again, over rated and definitely not a 5 star hotel","Stayed here with my mum a few months back.  Upon arrival check in was fine, we had several bags with us to carry, and there was a concierge who stood beside us doing nothing and didn't offer to help carry any of our bags or even help us with the lift.  I also overheard a group of men ask him to help them with their bags, which i felt for a supposed 5 star hotel is unacceptable to have to ask for help, they should show initiative, especially when they are standing there doing nothing!  The room was small, but fine.  I would warn anyone to be extremely careful when stepping in and out of the shower as it is extremely slippery as I slipped on 2 occasions.  I asked at reception about bath mats or something to stop from slipping and they said they didn't have anything for hygiene reasons.  When returning to our hotel that night there was no turn down service, which you would expect from a 5 star hotel,  I also phoned reception to ask about getting a few pillows that night but they said that they should really be ordered by a certain time that afternoon, which was after we even checked in!  However we did eventually get some pillows.  Another aspect of the hotel which was not good was the breakfast, there's a buffet, but its not great for a ""5 star hotel"" they had tiers of cheese and ham placed under low ceiling lights, which obviously got quite hot after a while, so the cheese began to curl up under the heat and did not look appetising! Some common sense wouldn't have gone a miss... Also on check out they tried to bill us for the room twice, even though we only stayed one night, and they also tried to charge us extra for the mini bar.       I have stayed in better 3 star hotels.  I would not recommend this hotel to others and I would never stay here again.",1,2012,03,23
226,"Great location, beautiful rooms, friendly staff.","This hotel is easy to find from the M1. First impressions were really good. The staff were friendly and the lobby looks very inviting & chic. We stayed in a superior room on the 5th floor which was spacious and comfortable. The bathroom was also big and had a separate bath & shower. We really enjoyed our stay here (2 nights), however I feel that it did not always live up to a 5 star hotel. Here is the sequence of events that make me think this: 1.The dimmer switch in the room was broken and you had to fiddle around with it to function/ not turn off the lights 2.Breakfast was ok, buffet style, nothing extraordinary-tasteless fry, I would have expected more on offer 3. On returning to the room, the cleaners were inside. We had to stand outside the room in the hall for 15 mins waiting for them to finish (despite them knowing we were there waiting), all the while they were having a full blown conversation in our room! 4. Later on that evening on returning to the room our key cards would not open the door (this meant a trip back to reception) as they had only been programmed for 24hrs instead of 48hrs. 5. The hotel website boasts ""bespoke toiletries"" in the bathroom, however the truth was shower gel, soap and shampoo which is the same crap/cheap brand you find in any hotel. 6. Finally, the 17GBP charge per day to park the car just cannot be justified! It may seem that this review is more about the negative, however I Just want to highlight that in isolation any one of these events probably would not matter, but these all happened within 1 day staying here and really took away the special feeling of treating oneself to 5 star ""luxury"" . Again the staff were all very friendly and we really enjoyed the trip, however my advice would be if you are looking for that really special hotel that you are willing to splash out on just the once... maybe look somewhere else!",4,2012,03,20
226,Great night's stay,"My husband booked a suite for our stay to go to Madame Butterfly at the Opera House last week. Our room was 801. Very clean, spacious and had everything you could want.
Double sinks and showers. 
As we were going to the opera, we ate in the Opera House but had drinks in the bar afterwards when we came back.  Great friendly staff. Air conditioning in the room, used it while we were getting ready to go out. Personally i felt a little too warm at night to get to sleep but my husband did not find it a problem.
Would def. go back.",5,2012,03,19
226,"Excellent bed, breakfast.","Brilliant stay here. Extra large comfy beds and very clean. 

Breakfast was good (though no beans) definitely try the potato bread (northern Ireland thing!). 

Room service was one of the best ive had.

One criticism would be ¬£10 tray charge for room service. ",5,2012,03,14
226,Location & Style - Ask for Kris!,"The location was terrific.  The room was even better!  I spent a week in Belfast and couldn't have been happier.  The hotel was an easy walk to any major location.  The room and bathroom were large, spacious and tasteful.  The very large bed was very comfortable.  Kris, one of the Concierges, had great dining suggestions, arranged a personal tour, and was extraordinarily friendly and helpful.  Everyone else was equally as heplful.  Although relatively small, th fitness room was well equipped and comfortable.  My only complaint was the 10 pound surcharge for room service.",5,2012,03,11
226,Fantastic,"Lovely clean hotel with stylish decor.Very friendly staff.
Cocktails in the bar is a must.
Only one complaint my husband was trying to surprise me with Champagne and strawberries on arrival but had to contact reception to request it again to be sent to the room and it kind of spoilt the surprise :-(
but other than that fantastic stay.Will be back!!!",4,2012,03,09
226,Overall a nice hotel,"We stayed here in dec for my wifes birthday.It is a nice hotel and the valet parking is very handy.The interior is nice although the bar is quite closed in.I just prefer a bit of a view with my drink.The lobby is nice and the rooms are large,modern and clean.The staff are very friendly and the hotel is literally city center.
Our only problem was with the food.My wife is vegetarian and the choice of meal was non existant.Even the chips were cooked in beef dripping! Her birthday tea ended up being a side salad,Even when we explained our dilemma to the waitress there was no alternative offered.
Breakfast I have to say was a farce! The continental side of it seemed ok but the hot food was just unbelievable.Five round tins with no food in them.People were sitting,plate in hand in a line waiting for them to be refilled.Even when they were there was a good 5 min wait between items,ie the sausages where brought out but that was all.They were cold before perhaps bacon was next.As for eggs ,we just didnt wait any longer but they hadnt arrived after 15mins.
Also the 4 pieces of soda and potatoes bread left had been put in the same tin as the left over black pudding.which was sitting on top of it, so again this wasnt an option for my wife.
If it hadnt been for the food it would have been great!
I still would return but just eat in one of the many restaurants nearby.",4,2012,03,08
226,Heart of belfast,The Fitzwilliam Hotel is right in the heart of Belfast on one of the main streets and right next to the Opera House. The design and decor is stylish throughout. The staff at the reception and check in were welcomimg and helpful. The bar servrd great cocktails of the day and was quite chilled to hang out in the evening. The corridors were rather dark ( very subduded lighting ) and the carpets were plush and deep. The room was of a reasonable size with ample seating area. All was spotlessly clean. The bathroom had a bath and a shower and all the toiletries you'd expect although the advertised robe was not there.The beds and bedding was very comfortable. The buffet breakfast was fine. The city tour buses practically stopped outside.A good hotel I would certainly go back to.,4,2012,02,28
226,"Highly overrated, highly over priced-dishonest, go elsewhere","We booked 2 nights at this hotel with an offer as accomodation and dinner.  Where to start?
It's in a good location....the rest...it's something between a 3 star and 4 star max., highly overrated and highly over priced for what it offers. The PR and marketing for this hotel is highly dishonest, even using the photo of City Hall instead of the actual hotel building on their handout sheets, and on other websites with various advertised offers beside the hotel name!!  Firstly, the dark decor (halways and black tiled bathrooms) it's not everyone's taste and certainly not mine, it resembles a shabby night club, very impersonal and distant, surely designed by a man, laughing all the way to the bank now!! On their website they advertise 'crisp Egyptian linen' but actually it looked more like low budget linen with split duvet cover (I will attach a photo later). The towels were supposed to be white but actually were a light grey from overuse (some 3 star hotels we used before had better quality linen and towels). The sofa and headboard tapestry were in need of a good clean, otherwise good size room! Very dissapointed as we expected more from a 5 star hotel! The most dissapointing thing is the way they are trying to deceive the potential customers with the advertising and the 'great deals' offered. The set menu included with our deal was a 2 course dinner. A small starter, then the main course only consists of the meat of choice, you need to pay extra for your potatoes/vegetables (side orders) and for 3.50 pounds you get a small portion of oily potatoes! Have never experienced this before, again, we got much nicer meals at some 3 star hotels that we used before. Very small portions and ripp off choices, (2 pounds for 2 slices of bread) food was nothing special so stay away from the restaurant, surely you can get better value meals elsewhere. The set up and design of the restaurant resembles a side of the road American diner, it doesnt have a great ambiance. All in all very dissapointed, wouldnt recommend",2,2012,02,28
226,"Gorgeous hotel, great location",We spent the weekend here recently and stayed in a corner deluxe room.  We stayed in one of their junior suites last year which was absolutely gorgeous and spacious so this room did feel smaller but had quirky touches such as folding doors between the bath and the rest of the room.  There are large floor to ceiling windows which give a great view but it also means that the noisy traffic from down below is very audible.  The junior suites were definitely quieter.  The air-con is also quite noisy but thank goodness we didn't have to use it much.  The service is very professional and helpful.  The breakfast buffet is not extensive but adequate.  I would have thought that this hotel is a good 4-star with gorgeous decor and nice touches in the room.,4,2012,02,27
226,Great location to explore Belfast,"We have stayed in this hotel several times in recent years, and have always been impressed with the quality of customer service and standard of accomodation. The public areas are bright with contemporary seating. The bar is friendly , although the boothes can be a tight squeeze. The rooms are spacious and well equipped with all you need for a comfortable stay. The hotel is situated next door to the Grand Opera House, which is always a good for a night out. A great selection of quality restaurants are all within 10 mins walk from the hotel...ie. Deanes, Cayenne, James Street South, Made in Belfast. Coco and Ginger. Atmospheric pubs like the iconic Crown Bar and Robinsons are directly across the road. The main shopping areas are only about 5 mins walk away. The hotel is 2 minutes from Great Victoria St train station and Europa bus station, which is convenient for either arrivals or exploring outside Belfast. If you have a car, the hotel charges ¬£17 per night for valet parking. However, McCausland car park beside the hotel charges ¬£5 overnight and resonable hourly charges. A multistorey car park is beside the nearby bus station.",5,2012,02,27
226,Complete and utter rip off,Booked with groupon voucher that was said to be worth ¬£240! What a lie! The room to book on their website as normal was 109 so they were basically saying for our two evening meals it would of been 131??? In the small print it also said price based on most expensive meal! Yet when we were seated we got a different menu from everyone else and it had not even half as many choices! Then when we asked to upgrade to the standard menu we were told the groupon menu was only worth 7.50 each? I don't think they sell a main meal at that price!!! Completely ripped us off! We only came here as we thought we were getting a real special deal! Instead they've taken us for mugs! Also waited ages for our wine only to be told it would take 15 mins to get a bottle of wine from downstairs to the restaurant? Even though we had been served our food already! Then our really expensive steak we upgraded too was cooked completly different that what we asked! The room doesn't seem to executive.....not any nicer than basic holiday inn! Which I think we'll book from now on as at least what you see is what you get! I don't know whether this mistake is with groupon or the fitzwilliam but all in all such a disappointment! ,3,2012,02,25
226,"Beautiful hotel, will def be back!","I stayed here recently with my boyfriend for his birthday! The staff were v friendly and the room was beautiful! We got a deluxe room with great views and a brill bathroom! Everything was v clean, we didnt eat here but thought we would try some cocktails in the bar that night! The bar was very crowded but the bar man gave us a sample drink for having to wait! The cocktails were amazing and not over priced! All the ingredients were fresh, only draw back was I thought breakfast sounded very overpriced! 
Will def try this hotel again! Excellent location and it should be the number one hotel in Belfast! ",5,2012,02,24
226,Sauna room led to sleepless night.. rude receptionist!,"my boyfriend and I had missed
our train so shortly after 12am we went to the fitzwilliam.
We had been excited to go in as we had planned to go here on our anniversary but after that experience we wont be back. Most hotels offer a discounted price when u check in so late but no... ¬£109 for a basic small viewless room and no breakfast. The receptionist was not a bit friendly she actually appeared
to look down on us! not 5* service!

I have to say i love the decor of this hotel and the dark corridors but this is the only thing i loved. the room was like a sauna.. we couldnt even sit in it never mind sleep. 
Of course when we phoned reception about this and the internet not working she said nothing could be done til morning... which was useless considering we were only staying one night. God
forbid she would have to get up off
her seat for 5mins.

i ended up lying awake on the sofa the whole night while my boyfriend tossed and turned.
On checkout we brought the issue up with the receptionist but she didn't even acknowledge the fact that we spoke.
There is no exaggeration in this story as i am sure you will find out. 
Whoever rated this hotel must have had a put on show for the night as it is not 5*

We ended up at the malmaison for our anniversary! ",1,2012,02,21
226,My kind of hotel,"Surprised at the poor reviews....I loved this hotel. Room was clean, bed was super-comfy, decent iron in the room, well laid-out, spacious, nice bathroom (although agree about the lack of toiletry space!), wifi was straightforward. Very happy would definitely return.",4,2012,02,20
226,Great for a treat!,"Very grand entrance and reception.  Check-in was fine.  Our room was on the 8th floor, so suffured no noise problems.   Bar staff were fantastic!!  The bar is really popular all day long.

Really nice rooms, good to have a bath and a shower, plenty of towels and hangers.

Our only gripes were, 
1 -  (although, prob our own fault)   it advertises that there is an i-pod player, I presumed that ment you could charge it also.  But there was no charger,  I asked the concierge, and he said they only had one, and they didnt know when it was coming back, and maybe it was best to buy one.

2  -  I wanted to get my wife a balloon taken to the restaurant we were going to celebrate her 40th birthday, but wanted to do it in secret, so asket the concierge for help orgainising the getting and delivering  of the balloon, again, no help.  If it had nothing to do with the hotel directly, he cant do anything???????????

3 --  I know mini-bars are known to be expensive, but that one takes the mick!

Apart from that it was fine.   There are other hotels just as good at a better rate though I thought.",4,2012,02,20
226,Just lovely!,"Good location for city hotel, easy walking to all amenities. Reception was busy upon arrival, though staff were very efficient. Bedrooms just perfect and very well designed. Great friendly staff both in restaurant and bar, food excellent, best food quality breakfast we have experienced in a long time. Well done to Gareth the Restaurant Manager and his team. We will be back!",4,2012,02,20
226,"Good Location, but would not return.","Review for Fitzwilliam Hotel Belfast -- 4th Floor Room.  

Pros:
- Good Location for walking around Central Belfast 

Cons: 
- Check-in was slow and inefficient -- too many people checking in/checking out and not enough front desk staff
- Bathroom Shower had black mold around the base and on the walls.  
- Bathroom wall was missing a couple tiles.
- Very limited counter space for bath toiletries.    
- Room had stained carpet in a number of different areas.  
- Thin walls -- could hear the TV in the adjacent room.  
- No clock in the room.  
- Business Center printer did not work until I fixed it, and then it was out of ink.  
- We checked our luggage with the Concierge, and upon return were asked to identify and retrieve it ourselves.   

 
Conclusion:
- Would not stay here again.",2,2012,02,19
226,classy,"I liked this hotel, it gives a very good feeling, friendly staff.  Bar looks trendy but closes ""rather early"".  lovely breakfast. no criticism to give actually",4,2012,02,19
226,"well-equipped, comfortable hotel","We stayed overnight and ate in the restaurant. Parking in the area is restricted so we used the hotel valet parking service (¬£17, or ¬£15 prebooked). our king-size bed was very comfortable, the room well appointed, and tea and coffee making facilities were most welcome.The bathroom was large, and included both large bath and separate shower. The location is perfect for a city break, being just a short stroll to City Hall and central Belfast, an area rich in excellent cafes and restaurants.
We ate dinner in the hotel. We thought that the food was expensive, bread, side dishes etc were separately priced, and not particularly memorable. Desserts sounded better on the menu than they actually delivered.
We had planned to eat breakfast on the next morning, but because we felt dinner had been over-priced, we decided to find breakfast in a nearby cafe. We both had superb coffee, croissants and freshly made pancakes for much less than the price of one breakfast in the hotel.
I would stay in the Fitzwilliam Hotel again, but probably on a room only basis.There is a plethora of eating places of all prices and ethnicity within an easy walk of the hotel, which I think would be more fun and better value than the hotel dining room.",3,2012,02,17
226,excellent hotel,"excellent hotel ,great location,within walking distance of top resturants and bars",5,2012,02,16
226,"Nice decor, great location","Stylish rooms with contemporary decor. We were very comfortable and I considered it reasonably priced. My only complaint would be that in the bathroom practicality has been overlooked in favour of style. There are no surfaces to put anything on, which was irritating (and resulted in  me dropping a favourite compact which smashed to smithereens on the floor). Clearly designed by a man! Apart from that it's in a great city centre location which gives a perfect base for exploring Belfast. We didn't dine.",4,2012,02,15
226,horrible food,"After staying in the hotel not only have i left out of pocket but very disappointed at the service in which i received during my stay.
I dinned in the restaurant were the food was bland, presented poorly and portions were dreadful, unless you want to spend even more money and add on a side to a ¬£18 dish that consists of very little. the staff looked as though they never sleep, is this due to being over worked?? , staff well-being is very important and this seemed to be non existent in this hotel.
I did have a drink in the bar were the staff are very relaxed but friendly and professional which is great although they did look as though they were very under staffed which resulted in delays which was a shame..",1,2012,02,14
226,Lovely Stylish Hotel in a Good Location,"Very nice stylish hotel. As you can see from the pictures, the rooms and lobby are smart and classy.

The location of the hotel is excellent, very close to the centre of Belfast.

All in all a very good option for a short stay in Belfast. 

One thing to note, there is no free parking.",4,2012,02,12
226,Too many niggling faults for a 5 Star Hotel,"Rooms and decor beautiful. Food luke warm at breakfast both days, cold plates. Dinner food v good but total mix up with what was included in price, a mess.  Service mediocre overall.",3,2012,02,11
226,Lovely hotel in great location,"Great room with view across Belfast, staff friendly and helpful.",4,2012,02,11
226,Nice Hotel,Ver nice hotel right in the centre of Belfast. The bedrooms are very modern and comfortable with a great bathroom. Valet parking was ¬£17 and easy to use and efficient. Staff were very attentive at breakfast.,5,2012,02,09
226,Superb Hotel,"This is a smart, modern hotel with more than a hint of luxury. 

We got a very warm welcome from the receptionist who could not have been more helpful. 

Passing along the dimly lit corridor that led to our fifth-floor room, we wondered if we were on the correct floor. Inside, however, the room was spacious and brightly lit, with great views over Belfast, enticing you to head out in to the city.

The room's decor is on the clinical side of trendy but definitely is comfortable. Huge comfy bed, flat screen TV, stereo, a walk-in shower, and candle lit bath tub.",5,2012,02,09
226,dont read negative reviews!!,"After reading a previous comment saying that groupon deals were not honoured at this hotel i was a bit worried! however i shouldnt have been. Everything about this hotel was fantastic from start to finish.

1- stopped at the hotel so my wife could ask where we could park the car, she came back to tell me that if i just parked it up on the kerb around the side some one from consierge would take my keys and park it for me. Excellent and for ¬£17 for a safe overnight stay i thought this was resonable.

2- got to reception (very fast ) and not a problem about groupon deal.

3- got to out room on the second floor (very impressed) good size room, good view, tea and coffee facilities and a brilliant bathroom with walk-in shower also!! spotlessly clean!

4-dinner at night was included, not a massive menu but there was a meat, chicken, fish and vegeterian option. Very nice indeed and very attentive service.

5- had a couple of drinks in the bar (wide variety and cocktails at reasonable prices)

6-check out fast and efficient

all in all an excellent stay at the fitzwilliam belfast!!",5,2012,02,06
226,Victory for Victoria,"My wife and I spent a night in the Fitzwilliam as part of our christmas present from our son, this included taking in a musical in Belfast. The room had been booked in December for 28th January, booking in time being from 2pm. On arrival at 3-20pm I was in formed at reception that there was no room available as they were running a little late with preparing the rooms, although others checking in were being allocated rooms. I was asked to come back around 4pm and a room may be available. No advice on where to spend our time nor the offer of a cup of tea. On returning to the hotel I approached another receptionist to check in and on giving my name the first receptionist stated that she didn't think there was a room ready for me. As this wasn't the case I was given the key to my room. I went to the concierge to collect my bag only to be told that it could not be found but it would be brought to my room. On arrival at the room I opened the door to be met by a strong smell of sewage. I drew this to the attention of staff who were in the corridor and one sprayed the room with air freshener. As this was being done the concierge arrived with my bag and informed me that the drains had been worked on during the day but had been fixed and opening the window would clear the smell. The smell did clear up during the short time we were in the room. We went to dine in the restaurant which was very nice and spacious, although service was a little slow the food was good. Having paid ¬£17 to park my car at the hotel and running a little late for the show I went to the concierge to have the car brought from the car park only to be told it would take about 15 mins as it was blocked in not knowing that I was going to use it before morning.  On arrival back to the room the stench was still there. I contacted the reception, Victoria, who arranged for the night concierge to come up to the room. On his arrival he entered the bathroom and had to cover his mouth and nose because of the stench, he then informed me that we should not have been put in the room and he would see about getting us moved. This was done and 5mins later the concierge arrived back with a complimentary bottle of wine and a note of apology from Victoria. Thank you Victoria and Killian (sorry if spelt wrongly). After a good nights sleep breakfast was welcomed and very good. Good selection of food and well presented. Restaurant staff were very polite and helpful.",3,2012,02,05
226,"Good deal, good value, nice posh place","Spent last weekend at the FitzWm.  Nice place, helpful people, nice room.  Good to have books to read at reception.  Didn't eat there.  Bar was OK.  Handy location.

We had a corner room with 2 glass walls, which was nice for looking out but after we turned the heating off (by taking the key card out of the power slot) the room got cold & stayed that way.  Not really a problem as it was our last morning.  The room has a CD player & a sign saying they have a selection of CDs at reception. When I asked at reception they didn't have any!  The TV picture was poor - many of us are used to sharp digital pictures but most channels were fuzzy old analogue.  

Lovely to have real coffee & a cafetiere in the room.  The bath was big & very nice for 2.

Overall, we had a v. nice time and we'd happily go back.",4,2012,02,04
226,Won't honour groupon voucher,"I recently purchased a voucher for this hotel and when I tried to book my stay on my preferred date,I was told that there was no availability,despite my friend booking a room ten minutes before. This is a disgrace - I even offered to forfeit the evening meal included in the deal and pay the surplus to upgrade but I was still refused a booking. This was not mentioned in the terms and conditions of the original offer. The hotel was not willing to help at all - very poor service.",1,2012,02,03
226,Superb Hotel,"This hotel is so elegant and modern that when I entered the lobby - for a split second - I wondered whether the staff might be a bit snooty.  Instead, I was greeted warmly and enjoyed excellent service from friendly, personable staff throughout my stay.  My room was especially comfortable and the hotel so generally nice that I almost hated to leave.  A very high quality establishment.  I quite enjoyed my stay.",5,2012,02,01
226,The Service cannot be beat!  They never told me no!,"I can't say enough about the service at this hotel.  It was very clean, beautiful updated facility with a warm and inviting lobby.  Their best feature was their concierge staff and the front desk team.  They made arrangements for several trips for me and advised what was safe for a single woman alone.  They sent me shopping when I had a wardrobe emergency and repaired my shoes when I had that problem.  Declan deserves special mention - he is amazing and heard us discussing my forgotten blackberry cord and he went and got one for me without being asked.  He called people he knew to make arrangements for things we went to do and met my schedule to the minute for taxis and trains.  Thanks so much to the staff at this facility and I will be back Declan!  

If you travel to Belfast you should realize that in older buildings don't regulate the heat like the US and so wear short sleeves but be ready to layer.  That will save you a wardrobe shopping emergency.",5,2012,01,28
226,What star is this hotel???,"Having used the room to dress for our wedding and staying two nights, i though value for money it was okay. Been waiting for my complaint to be replied to before i wrote but no response as of yet. Everything was good, nice room, upgraded to a superior, fine bathroom, friendly staff....but the goodness seemed too vanise upon check out.
Our groupon deal on checkout was not honoured and the lady on reception refused to budge, saying we has upgraded our menu - which we didn't. Waiting to see the manager who works as a concierge, he was too busy to talk, (but a very nice man). I have emailed and await an explaination .....
Over priced room tray service of ¬£10 a timme plus your order, rediculous mini bar prices....but 5 star i guess and city centre....... much better value for money elsewhere.........or next hotel the Manor House Enniskillen blows them out of the water.",3,2012,01,27
226,Reasonable hotel,"I stay in this hotel on business. Its in a convenient location, its clean and well maintained. It has tried a little too hard to be cool - coridoors furnished with black carpets, dark wall coverings and very low lighting (finding your room is interesting in the dark). Having said this, the rooms are large and comfortable with big bathrooms. Staff are all very efficient and friendly.

The food isn't great - a little too heavy, rich and meat oriented. If you want something lighter, walk down the road to a nearby restaurant like Deane's.",3,2012,01,25
226,Fantastic customer service - stylish but comfortable hotel,"I arrived while on business and had the flu. To make things worse there was no record of my booking as there was a mix up from my company. The checkin staff were very friendly and professional and quickly had me in a really comfortable room. I didn't get to experience the restaurant, but the room service menu was excellent. 

Is absolutely the first hotel I will look up when I next return to Belfast.",5,2012,01,23
226,Styles itself as equiv to the merchant,"Hmmm nice hotel, good room, snazzy decor but not a patch on the merchant.
Although to be fair much cheaper.
Dinner very disappointing, 

Its a nice hotel for the city centre",4,2012,01,23
226,Welcoming hotel,"Very nice hotel with friendly staff. The rooms were big, had comfy beds and I actually liked the darker decor. The staff at breakfast seemed a bit stressed out though and forgot some of our orders, but that is a minor complaint. Situated close to restaurants, shopping and bars.",4,2012,01,23
226,short and sweet,"stayed here for one night, lovely ambience, liked the decor in the rooms, really central for whats going on in belfast, had a deal including dinner, pretty posh food, served really well, but a wee bit shy on the portions!! But probably better for the figure!",4,2012,01,23
226,Nice modern hotel,Nice modern hotel with comfy rooms. Great location. Parking should be complementry.,4,2012,01,23
226,not worth money.,We purchased this overnight stay with groupon at a cost of ¬£110 for 2 people. not cheap as no breakfast included. it stated an evening meal but it was in fact a main course off a very basic menu. we asked 4 the usual menu and it wasnt much better. a very limited choice and something we could cook ourselves. no prizes for restaurant. have stayed in better cheaper hotels & had better food from subway. would not recommend this hotel. better value at premier inn. Sorry.,2,2012,01,22
226,Good trendy hotel.,Eight of us stayed for a friends 30th and we were all impressed. The hotel is in a good location with helpful staff. Rooms were of a good size with modern and very well done decor. Lighting in the corridors was however a little dark. Good bar downstairs and they didn't seem to mind making multiple Old Fashioned drink's. ,4,2012,01,22
226,Fitzwilliam suite,"Greeted at reception by a very kind knowledgable young lady. The room was so much more than my wife and I were expecting. The lay out was so perfect, seperate wc and shower, two rose shower heads in a huge wet room. The bed was enormous and very confortable. The room was very clean and tea and coffee facilities were at hand. We ate in the bar and were again pleasently surprised at the meal which was beautiful and provided excellent value for money. Breakfast was a bit disappointing, self service exposed a shortage of fried eggs!! We survived and overall the breakfast hit the spot. Parking comes at a price for a 1 night stay ¬£17. The staff were fantastic, strongly recommended.",5,2012,01,22
226,Would go back again,Really enjoyed my stay and would recommend it for a short city break,4,2012,01,19
226,What sort of a hotel does not honour vouchers?,"I today purchased a groupon voucher for this hotel, which had an expiry date of feb 29 2012. When I rang the hotel to make a reservation for Saturday fornight, there was no problem until I informed them I would be using a voucher, at which point they informed me they had no weekend vacancy until after the voucher had expired. Now I am stuck with a ‚Ç¨125 groupon credit. Thanks for nothing Fitzwilliam - good to see rip-off Ireland is alive and well!",1,2012,01,19
226,Stylish hotel ‚Äì¬†but with room for improvement,"The hotel is modern and stylish. There‚Äôs a lovely lobby where you can sit by the fire by the day. The rooms are tastefully decorated. We stayed in a deluxe double room. I‚Äôd really recommend paying a bit extra to get one of these rooms. It had an excellent view with windows across two sides of the room. Both reception and housekeeping staff were friendly and professional.

The only thing that bought the hotel down was the room service. We‚Äôre vegetarians ‚Äì so we were a disappointed when we called up room service to find out that the only vegetarian option on the Christmas Eve menu was a parmesan and salad sandwich. These worked out at about ¬£14 each once you include tray charge‚Ä¶ so we were even more disappointed when they arrived and they had NO cheese in them! They were essentially two bits of bread with some salad in the middle ‚Äì a bit of a let down‚Ä¶

Still on the subject of room service ‚Äì we only had one cup in our room and there were two of us, so my boyfriend ended up drinking his coffee in the morning out of a glass. I called up twice on two different days to ask if we could get second cup. Both times the guy I spoke to said ‚Äòyes, no problem‚Äô‚Ä¶ but both times no cup arrived‚Ä¶

However I should stress that these room service niggles are small compared with the overall stylishness and comfort of the hotel. I‚Äôm from Belfast originally, and when I next go back I will stay in the Fitzwilliam again as the pluspoints definitely win out.",4,2012,01,16
226,Christmas treat,"This was a Christmas present from my husband which we both immensely enjoyed. We only live 30 minutes from Belfast but staying in the Fitzwilliam felt like we could have been in any city in the world. It is modern and chic with fabulous foyer with fireplace. Our room was an executive double which had a huge bed, sofa, bathroom with shower and separate bath. Tea and coffee making facilities even had a cafetiere for two.

Like a previous comment has said the corridors are extremely dark and the hotel does seem to lack natural light throughout. There were also no windows in the restaurant either.

Breakfast, however, was a feast. Presentation was excellent and there was an abundance of fresh fruit, cereal, juices, croissants, cooked breakfasts and also omelettes, eggs benedict, pancakes etc. The americano was one of the best I've had.

The hotel do charge ¬£17 for use of their car park which is expensive so we used McCausland car park 1 minutes walk away on the Grosvenor Rd which was only ¬£5 from 5pm Saturday to 12 noon Sunday.

I would definitely stay here again and recommend it. Street noise was minimal.",5,2012,01,15
226,Great hotel; highly recommended,"A few coworkers and I recently stayed a the Fitzwilliam and I have to say things started on the right foot.  We took a red eye into Dublin, then a 2 hour bus ride to Belfast so suffice to say we were exhausted when we showed up to the Fitzwilliam at 8:30 AM and were worried it was too early to check in, however they were able to get us rooms right away.

The hotel is super modern, and not very large which i prefer.  A recent reviewer complained about noise and i have to say I did not have the same experience.  Things were super quiet apart from the occasional street noise but that will happen at any hotel in that area of Belfast.

The rooms are ultra modern and super clean which is an expectation of mine when i travel.

The breakfast was pretty good.  It was a typical continental breakfast however with the breakfast plan you can order hot items off of the menu which is nice.  The pancakes are really good.

The concierge was awesome.  He was so helpful from providing Blackberry charges, power converters, making reservations and setting up tours.  He was there to please and to be helpful.

The hotel is in a good location right next to the Opera House and a 5 minute walk to the City Center/City Hall.

The next time Im in Belfast  i will stay at the the Fitzwilliam.",5,2012,01,13
226,A bedroom which doesn't allow you to sleep,"After what is now 26 hours awake, I'm writing this review from a noisy bedroom with the sound of wind tearing through the bedroom and the garbage bins outside banging together.

Having been moved ones from a 'road' facing room, I was hoping room 2 would be quieter. No - 'the quieter side' is infact twice as noisy.

Yes, I understand you can't control the weather, however the hotel could invest in windows without gaps at the top in and perhaps a secure place to keep their rubbish bins.

Rooms are gorgeous to look at, however 'bedroom' is not a good word as the main function does not serve its purpose! If you want to sleep, I'd recommend spending your money elsewhere.

Not impressed at all! Bring on the next 12 hours so I can attempt sleeping again - nothing like a 38 waking hour day!!!! ",2,2012,01,12
226,Very nice hotel,"My husband and I stayed here for a couple of nights for our wedding anniversary earlier this year.  We were very impressed upon arrival and the staff couldn't do enough for you.  Room was beautiful and modern, just our taste.  Really comfy bed and the bathroom was out of this world.  As far as quality of the room goes couldn't fault it at all.  Probably one of the best rooms we've stayed in.  We are guest house owners and we expect a high standard.

There are only 2 things I would say that could be looked at, first of all the lighting in the corridors between the lift and the rooms is extremely low and hard to see.  The second thing and to be honest the incident that spoiled our stay was housekeeping knocking on our door at 8am to service the room and waking us up, when we were staying another night.  We very rarely get a lie in and we were very disappointed by this.  Surely housekeeping should be notified if guests are staying more than 1 night.  

Other than that, an excellent stay and we enjoyed breakfast and also dinner in the restaurant.  Food was to a high standard as was the staff.  Will definately stay at the Fitzwilliam again for a special treat.  We love Belfast.",4,2012,01,07
226,Very comfortable hotel,"I had a pleasant stay here, check-in staff were very friendly & concierge efficient. The room was suprisingly large, with a stunning bathroom, very comfortable king bed and good work station. The location is quite good with many good restaurants & pubs nearby - I highly recommend staying at The Fitzwilliam.",4,2012,01,06
226,Would definately call again!,"As we were going to a show in the grand opera house, I decided to treat my other half to a night in the Fitzwilliam hotel so we could relax and have a few drinks rather than decide who was driving.
I booked an executive room, but when we arrived we were upgraded to a Suite - a nice surprise to arrive to! The suite was fantastic, with spacious living area, bathroom and a large wet room as opposed to a shower. The only thing would be that it is all very open plan - which didn't bother us, but if you prefer your privacy in the morning, it may not be ideal.

We went to the bar before hitting the Opera House, I ordered a strawberry dacquiri while the other half had a beer of some sort. The cocktail was beautiful, and we sat at the bar watching the barman concoct other cocktails - very interesting to watch! Before we knew it, it was time to go to the Opera House, but we returned to the bar when the show was over. 

Unfortunately, when we returned, we were informed that there would be no more cocktails, as they had run out of ingredients. From talking to the waiting staff, this wasn't a regular occurance, but it was the Christmas holidays, and they had been serving cocktails all day. 
I ordered a Bailey's coffee instead, but my luck must have ran out completely - after one, the cream was locked in the kitchen fridge and that was the end of my coffees! But, I should compliment the barman on his manners - he was very apologetic about this.

After a few more drinks we returned to our suite. The suite was full of little extras, which we wouldn't be used to, as we usually just book a standard double room. Fully stocked mini bar, reading material, slippers, bathrobes, shoe shine etc etc.

The only complaint we had about the suite was the temperature. We couldn't pull the quilt over us, as the heat was shocking. There is a air conditioning unit, but a) I couldn't figure it out, being a complete technophobic, and b) it was very noisy when running, so we couldn't sleep with it on. 

Breakfast the next morning was tasty, with full continental, full fry up, and selection of fruits, yoghurts available. Also at the table was a full menu so we could pick what we liked. I had cereal, then homemade pancakes, toast and fruit (set myself up for the day!) The other half had the same, except had a full fry instead of the pancakes.  The one thing that annoyed us slightly was that after bringing tea to our table, the waitress disappeared, and I had to go looking for her to order my panccakes, and to ask her to take my other half's order. Although the fried food was usually self service, there was absolutely nothing there, so we had to wait on this being made, and then go up to the self service. This resulted in my fiance watching me eat pancakes, and then me watching him eat a fry.

We also availed of the concierge parking, which was ¬£15. Although we researched this before booking, and thought it a bit excessive, in hindsight, we think it was actually a good idea. We parked the car beside the hotel door, it was parked in a secure car park for the night, instead of the street, and when  we checked out in the morning and decided to go shopping, we asked if we could leave the car there for a few hours, which the hotel agreed to. So we parked for the best part of a day for ¬£15. 

All in all, although there were a few prickly points, mainly the temperature in the room, we will be back again, we thoroughly enjoyed the stay. (The temperature is the only reason i have marked the sleeping quality as average - the bed was extremely comfy!)",4,2012,01,05
226,"Nearly 'very good', but not quite.","Stayed here for one night last week. Lovely hotel, well-situated and very contemporary in finish. However....
I had searched online for best deals, and also phoned the hotel to enquire about rates, having taken onboard a hint from a friend in the hospitality industry to always speak directly with the hotel. The operator on the phone couldn't match the online rate, and said that there are mostly better deals online. Check-in was fine, and even though we arrived earlier than the stated time, a room was ready for us. I had stated during booking online that the overnight stay was for our wedding anniversary, and had perhaps hoped that it might be noted by the hotel, but it wasn't mentioned - whether this was the booking agent's or the hotel's fault, I cannot say, but I was a little disappointed that it was not acknowledged.
The room was clean, spacious and well-finished, but the lighting was a little dodgy, in that when we left it on for longer than about 10minutes, the lights flickered on and off intermittently. This was quite annoying. The heating was over-efficient, and unfortunately the air-con was not adequate to bring the room to a comfortable temperature - I believe the heating is 'under-floor'. This was to prove unbearable during the night, when we had to leave open the window AND bedroom door to encourage a through-breeze - not really conducive to a restful or peaceful night's sleep. We heard a lot of road noise throughout the night - emergency vehicles etc.. I ended up sleeping on the couch in front of the window to get as close as possible to the little waft of air, and my husband dozed on the chair. The breakfast room suffered from the same overheated condition, and really put me off my food. We felt par-boiled. 
The breakfast selection was sufficient, but not magnificent, as you would expect. The breakfast room is beautifully-set, and is clean and well-maintained. There were lots of staff, but a little friendliness would have warmed the atmosphere.
In the bedroom, there were nice little touches, like the candle in the bathroom, and a cafetiere with the tea/coffee tray. Another good point was the availability of umbrellas in the foyer. Since it rained constantly the whole time we were there, we made very good use of one, and it was much appreciated. 
We were disappointed with the hotel to be completely honest, and I really don't think we would stay again. There is a proliferation of very good hotels in the area, and so we have booked one of these for Valentine's Day next month. Had the room been a comfortable temperature, I don't think the other niggles would necessarily have prompted an 'average' response, and we would have returned. I acknowledge however that we did not give the hotel a chance to fix this, since it was after midnight when we discovered the air-con would not cool us down, and we were reluctant to move room or have someone call at that stage of the night. I read previously that someone else had a sauna-experience - perhaps it is something the Fitzwilliam management would like to take on board, maybe even saving some money in the process!!!",3,2012,01,05
226,All round fab hotel!,"Just returned from a superb 2 night stay in the Fitzwilliam Belfast..From the moment we arrived the staff really went out of their way to make our stay as confortable and enjoyable as they could..Check in was excellent and hassle free, Concierge was very helpful in recommending nearby restaurants. The hotel also offer a valet car parking service, It cost ¬£17 per night which I thought was a little bit expensive..However at least we knew our car was safe... Our room was on the fifth floor, and it was excellent..beautifully decorated and everything that you would expect from 5star hotel, bathroom was also nicely finished, with rain shower and big bath tub...room also had nice t.v. and had funky lighting throughout..We did not have dinner in the restaurant so cant comment on that, we did however have breakfast and have to say it was not that good, they kept running out of bacon etc..it was the only negative I could say about the hotel...The bar was also great, again thoughtfully decorated and funky in sytle.. a little bit pricey for cocktails etc but then again you get what you pay for...Quality and 5 Star service...Would defo recommend this hotel to a friend and hopefully we will back soon...Thanks to all the staff for a wonderful experience...Paul",5,2011,12,30
226,Not bad but not 5 star!,"Five star? Who gave this hotel such a rating? At best it is a good four star hotel but is a million miles from being a top notch establishment.

Good efficient reception but once in the room we discovered that numerous things were lacking. The safe did not work, no bathrobes, poor towel quality and room lighting that was designed for its good looks rather than being purposeful. Early mornings we were disturbed by staff bringing the cleaning trolleys from a service door opposite our room, no care or attention to guests sleep.

Breakfast was good but service is slow. The Bar is similar, with good food and wine list but the service could be better.

If pushed we would go back but I wouldn't rush.",3,2011,12,30
226,Main Resteraunt Good but not Great,"Had dinner in the main resteraunt on arrival reception desk lacked a smile and eye contact, all a bit to quick and felt rushed when we booked the table by phone. Why is it that hotel owners miss the finer detail regarding customer service, what happened to ""Good evening sir, welcome to the Fitzwilliam hotel Belfast, how may I help you? Instead of a blank stare, such a shame, lack of attension to detail I am afraid. Main course good but deserts uninspiring, because of above slow to return",3,2011,12,29
226,"Great Hotel, brilliant stay","Currently in Fitzwilliam Hotel staying over Christmas to visit family. Can't fault the place, it's beautifully decorated and the staff are friendly. Breakfast is lovely too! 
Will definitely stay here again. 
PS bring conditioner for your hair, that's the only thing missing.",5,2011,12,25
226,"Great hotel, excellent location",My husband and I spent our wedding anniversary in a delux room at the Fitzwilliam and it was a really great experience. We walked in and the fact that it was on the front corner of the hotel with floor to ceiling glass windows was something else. We had a package with champagne and strawberries. The one negative was that they had placed the champagne and strawberries in the room whilst we were out meaning it was flat and everything was warm by the time we arrived back into the room. Apart from that we were really impressed with our stay and would definitely stay again,5,2011,12,24
226,Festive Afternoon Tea @ The Fitzwilliam,"Me and my mother booked the festive afternoon tea here which we found advertised on their website.  The afternoon tea is served in the lobby with a lovely big fire.  The afternoon tea includes a pot of tea with re fills, a glass of mulled wine each which was lovely, sandwiches which were delicious, I had the vegetarian option which was cheese and tomato and salad. Then came a plate of mini festive treats, including chocolates, scones with your cream and jams, tarts, mince pies and a few other festive nibbles.  We thought the food was lovely, and a great deal for ¬£25 for 2 people, as we were stuffed afterwards!  I would highly recommend to others.",4,2011,12,23
226,Great Hotel. Superb Location,"Have stayed in quite a few good hotels in Belfast and surrounding areas such as The Culloden; Ten Square and The Stormont - all good hotels. The Fitzwilliam has been a real find. Close to all the main shopping streets yet far enough way for some peace and quiet. Great reception area. Lovely , tastefully furnished bedrooms and friendly welcoming staff. If that was not enough a first class restaurant serving excellent food. Now my hotel of choice in Belfast.",5,2011,12,23
226,Very Disappointing,"We wiil not return to this hotel, poor mananagment,be careful of shower tray which is slippery/dangerous",2,2011,12,21
226,Don't go for the food!!!,"Had my first experience of this place at a work Christmas do last Friday and expected good things only to be disappointed.  
We paid ¬£38 for a 4 course meal and entertainment, only problem was it was 3 very average courses and no entertainment.  I got Fois Gras for starter, the Pate tasted nice but I got 2 small soggy bits of bread so I couldn't even eat all the Pate.  Some people got the pigeon which took 2 mouthfuls to finish.
Then the main, I got the steak which I had no choice to how it was cooked, I just got it as did other people, cooked medium rare.  It was just ok, had a very oily taste, like it has been dipped in a fryer and wasn't great.  The veg was a joke, dark carrots and no sauce, just a tiny bit of gravy and a couple of baby potatoes.
The dessert was the best bit with the chocolate mousse but I had to eat someone elses to get filled up.
I was then expecting tea and coffee but never came and no entertainment, that was the bar downstairs which wasn't even that good.
Overall I was disappointed again at my work xmas do, last year was a complete let down as well at one of these fancy places.  I would not go back here for food and it has put me off staying here for a night if food is like that.  I understand they were busy but I felt no effort was made at all.
If you are going for a Christmas do again, DO NOT go to these fancy hotels and restaurants, they all disappoint greatly.",2,2011,12,20
226,Nice,"We stayed here for my hen party this summer and were greeted by very friendly staff that were very helpful. Its great that they park your car - though not sure where the car park is. The rooms were nice but quite small overall (we booked about 6 rooms) and they were snug for 2 people.. Food in the rest' wasnt great at all however, so dont think we'd eat there again (not many of our party ate much of it..) but again, staff were very helpful. The massive downside was that the air con in the room was broken (in a few rooms also) and the windows couldnt be opened, so we were boiling all night. They did give us fans and apologised when we complained (a good few times!!) but they didnt fix the issue. I would have been annoyed if I wasnt at my hen party but had i been there for a whole weekend, it woulnd have been acceptable to be fair..

Location wise, its about a 10min walk into the shops (Victoria sqaure) its near Jurys also.",3,2011,12,19
226,Great hotel!!!!,"Stayed for one night in a mini suite which is on the eighth floor. The room was excellent as was the view.

Unusually I did not read about the hotel on trip advisor before my stay. Based on various negative comments I may not have booked it however that would have been a mistake.

This is an excellent hotel with a relaxing ambience contributed to by the staff and decor. I dined out so cannot comment on the restaurant however the bar was excellent.

Breakfast was as good as I have experienced in some other 'better' hotels. Well worth a visit and I will be back!",4,2011,12,14
226,early christmas gift,"i recently booked this hotel for my mother and father in law.having previously lived in belfast,i had heard nothing but good comments about this hotel with regards to staying and meals so i was well chuffed when a deal came up.they stayed in the hotel for one night only to do some early xmas shopping.i had booked the hotel through bookings.com.having done this i contacted the hotel a week prior to their arrival to book parking and to make sure that they would not need my card for verification on arrival.i was read back my credit card details and told that because i had rang in in advance that they could use these details once they had checked in.,this was not the case.they were asked to pay ¬£50 deposit on arrival and charged this plus the stay in the hotel.i was then charged as well on my card.it wasnt until the following day that this was noticed when they handed my mother in law a breakdown of the prices.once the error was seen they credited my credit card but not my mother in law.i contacted the hotel and explained the situation.they were helpful to a point and quite apologetic to begin with.i had previously explained on my initial phone cal that this was a gift so i couldnt understand why they had been given a breakdown of the prices,i explained that the goodness had been taken out of the gift by all the stress and hassle that this had caused.they were also not able to verify exactly who they had credited back the overcharge so in the meantime we had to wait to be refunded/.they also wanted credit card statements and bank statements showing this,even though in the itemised bill it was clear to see that both had been charged.i wasnt at all impressed with how it was dealt with after this and i dont feel that they even cared that it had been their error.5 star,i think not.i wont be recommending it to friends or family in the future-no matter how good the deal.a total disaster",3,2011,12,13
226,Christmas Party with stay over,"We where part of an office Christmas party here, both staying over night and eating in the hotel.

In relation to location the hotel is ideally located in the heart of the city close to the railway Station and during this month a stones throw from the Belfast Christams Markets (19th November to 19th December).

The hotel staff were friendly, the rooms are big and bright and he bathrooms a good size.

The food was average for me and nothing special. Also we had to que for 20 minutes for breakfast so I would advise getting down early.

The door staff instructed some of our members not to dance in the bar?!.....don't know what this was about or why!

",4,2011,12,10
226,"Excellent hotel, only let down by breakfast","Myself and my partner stayed here last week along with another couple, the hotel is beautiful, modern and in a great location. Staff are very friendly and even the guests seemed to be all in great form and friendly.
Only reason for not giving 5 stars is that the buffet breakfast let it down slightly. This is certainly no reflection on the food which was second to none, but due to the fact that they were very slow to refill the various hot trays containing the hot food. When we arrived there were mushrooms available but by the time i reached them they were finished and they were not refilled. That said, i did not ask the waiter to bring them to me, but you shouldn't have to. Even the other main items like bacon were allowed to run out before they were re stocked.
this was the only let down, otherwise everything was faultless",4,2011,12,10
226,Cant Wait To Go Back !,"This was my 1st time staying in The Fitzwilliam Hotel. The room was fantastic...beautifully laid out.....the restaurant was fab and the evening meal also.The bar was great, well set out and was buzzin with people.......the reception staff were very polite and very very helpful. The hotel is very well located to the city centre with loads of shops....bars.....restaurants etc.....my stay was very very pleasant and will be returning to this hotel at some stage in the near future.",5,2011,12,10
226,Can't wait to go back!,"This was my 4th time staying in The Fitzwilliam Hotel, I love everything about it. The rooms are luxurious and I always have a good nights sleep.  The staff are lovely,they think of everything - the hand written notes welcoming you to the hotel with chocolates is a great touch, I have recommended it to so many people and they all love it too!  Can't wait to go back!",5,2011,12,09
226,Lovely corner room,"Although I was born in Belfast, I hadn't been back for several years, and I was looking forward to staying at one of the many new hotels in the city.  The Fitzwilliam cannot be faulted for comfort and service.  My room was on the corner of Great Victoria Street and Grosvenor Road, with a view of the City Hall - I was nervous that it would be noisy, being on a busy intersection, but six floors up I was undisturbed.  The room itself was excellently fitted out, with a full-sized bath and huge walk-in shower.  A small niggle - I would have liked a bigger shelf above the wash-basin.   There was a good work area as well as one of the most comfortable beds I've ever slept in.  The wardrobe was well-provided with proper hangers and decent drawer space.

I had breakfast both mornings of my stay, and found the selection good, with the possibility of ordering special items as well as eating from the buffet.  Even though the hotel was very busy, I was seated for breakfast right away and was able to serve myself without having to queue.  I also had dinner on Saturday night with some relatives - I was glad that I'd prebooked the table, as the restaurant was very busy.  The meal was delicious, with a good choice of well-priced wines, and the service was efficient.  After the meal, we sat in the lobby lounge drinking until around midnight, rather than the bar, which was too noisy for us.

Overall, a very pleasant stay in a centrally located hotel.",5,2011,12,07
226,"Went for business trip, but felt like spa trip!","Loved it - a real treat. The staff were helpful and courteous - and not OTT. Rooms were fantastic - loved the bathrooms and simple touches like a little candle besides the bath. Meeting room overlooking the hills was great - and very relaxing view. Will definately be going back there. 5 star in terms of service.

(only downside if I was being picky was the low bed base which sticks out beyond mattress. When the bed is dressed with its duvet etc - you cant see the sharp low corners - so I am still wearing a beautiful purple bruise on my shin)!",5,2011,12,07
226,Great hotel in belfast,"This is probably one of the best hotels in Belfast. Comfortable rooms, nice staff, excellent bar, decent location. I prefer this to the Europa.

I stay here a few times every year and it serves me well - I will be back.",5,2011,12,06
226,"Delightful stay at the ""Fitz""","We arrived at the hotel early knowing that we wouldn't be able to have our room until 2pm. Our intention was to leave our suitcase at the hotel and go for breakfast/lunch until the room was ready. The receptionist took one look at me and could see I have a problem walking and immeadiately offered to see if a room was available(it was around 10am). There wasn't ,but she said we would have the first available room. We went off and came back to the hotel arounf 11.30am, decided to have coffee in the front lounge and wait by the lovely fire until our room was ready. They did'nt let us down and just after 11am we were escorted to our room by the Concierge . The room was beautiful. It was spacious, clean and very comfy. Kingsize bed, Flat screen TV, 4 seater sofa,Fridge(Everything in there was a bit pricey) Music system, Hairdrier, iron and i/board, double wardrobe with plenty of hangers and a bathroom to die for with lovely fluffy soft towels toiletries etc. The shower was big enough for 4 people if your into that and the bath even had candles to help you relax . All in all a lovely stay, all the staff were very friendly, not pushy or abrupt and made you feel that you no matter what you asked it was no trouble for them to sort out. Well done to everyone at ""The Fitzwilliam""",5,2011,12,06
226,City chic with issues,"A two night trip to Belfast staying in a first class hotel. 

Good location, only 10/15 mins from City Airport and same walk from the City Hall. Rooms spacious and well laid out once you get the hang of what's what. Well furnished and equipped.

Breakfast good quality as was nearly all of the service, particularly front of house.

Let down? The bar. First night waited for 35 mins before cocktails arrived and second night we walked out after waiting 40 mins. Not good enough fro an establishment like this. Told in the morning it was due to an evening of ""cocktail tasting"". They were lucky, we didn't taste any.

Won't put us off coming back but we won't bother trying to spend any money there next time. Not a problem as plenty of choice available elsewhere.",4,2011,12,05
226,Disapointment for first stay in Belfast @ Europa,"Arrived at 2 p.m. (pre booked at least 2 months in advance) then kept waiting in foyer for two hours because room was not ready.  Their excuse?  They had been full the night before and room cleaning was running behind (isn't the general idea when running a successful hotel to be full??!!)

Finally got room keys at 4.30 p.m.  Room OK (executive) however the next day at breadkfast we ending queueing for 30 minutes from 9.00 a.m. Their excuse this time?  Well everybody came down together (Urghhh!!! have they ever run a hotel before?!).

When we did get a table (dirty and not cleared - we were ignored by 3 members of staff before another grudgingly cleared the plates - this happened again later when we had finished our cereal!)

It got worse - queue to make yourt own toast, no butter, no glasses for juice and the 'buffet' breakfast looked minging, so we stuck to fruit and cereal.

Never again, such a shame Belfast and the people there were fabulous!!",2,2011,12,05
226,Disappointing!,"Myself and partner booked this deal through Groupon (1 night stay/evening meal) for ¬£109 which seemed like good value. The hotel and room is very modern and boutique looking in appearance, good location. We had our main course meal (not warm) but all the side orders were extra which appeared a little bit deceptive. The car parking was also ¬£17 per night (car park across road (¬£14). We went for breakfast the next morning which cost ¬£25 which in my mind is ridiculous when there are numerous cafes nearby where you could have a much better breakfast/service for half the price - very disappointing. People were standing around waiting for the canopes to be filled, poor service. A glass of house wine was ¬£5.50 which again i think is a little bit pricey. Overall we ended up spending ¬£180 with all the hidden charges i.e. car parking, side orders, breakfast etc. Ohh and be careful with using TV, press the wrong button and you'll get charged for using it, which we did - twice. Almost forgot, if you order room service, which again we did on two occcasions, it cost ¬£5 each time. There are much better places to stay in Belfast with no hidden charges, shop around, very disappointed customers, not happy!!",2,2011,12,05
226,Great location,"The Fitzwilliam provides the perfect base from which to explore Belfast city - handy to all the amenities and easy walking distance to pubs, shops and restaurants. Clean, large rooms and friendly staff. Great food. Reception staff weren't on top of all aspects of the booking - the hotel was prepaid so they didn't take a credit card swipe which meant we couldn't access the minibar or telephone - had to go down to reception on two occasions to get these things sorted. But these minor issues didn't spoil the otherwise good service.",4,2011,12,05
226,A beacon of shining light,"Love the hotel, amazing location, clean and beautiful interior. Staff is really helpfull and food is off the hook. Breakfast buffet has plenty of choice plus a la carte options. Can only recommend this hotel.",5,2011,11,28
226,Honest review,"Stayed here last night after my 40th birthday party. Location perfect, rooms fairly standard. 4 star hotel at best",3,2011,11,27
226,"""All fur & no knickers""...","
This is the second time I've stayed at The Fitzwilliam Hotel... My last stay was a train crash of Faulty Tower style disasters but every establishment can have an off day. This weekend I had a city-centre party to attend so I decided to give this hotel a second chance. It's location and rooms are excellent but yet again it's service let me down.¬†

After calling ahead to check if the hotel had car parking facilities, I was told yes. When I check-in the car park was full and was told I should have booked my car in, It would have been nice if someone had mentioned this when I called! I finished up parking my car in an overnight multi story¬†on the Dublin Road. (only ¬£4). FYI... I later read the hotel would have charged me ¬£17 so it worked out for the best.

Next morning when I went down for breakfast I and 4 other rather unhappy couples had to wait 15 minutes to get tables!... When we got seated, the hot buffet breakfast had not been re-stocked, there was almost nothing left. The staff and manager were running all over the place but no one had check to see if there was enough food. We complained and had to wait another 10 minutes... When it eventually arrived, the food was excellent.¬†

To summarise, this 4 star hotel and its location is excellent but it continues to offer a 2 star service. The management are arrogant if they¬†believe this is expectable!... The hotel is very overpriced for what it offers. Two other neighbouring hotels I frequently use offer a MUCH better level of service. Unless I'm stuck, I'll probably not be back. We have a saying in Northern Ireland...""All fur and no knickers""... This describes the Fitzwilliam Hotel to a tee.",3,2011,11,27
226,Nice Hotel - Careful of T&C's,"We stayed in this hotel recently, great location, staff friendly & rooms spotless. It's ¬£17 to park your car on a daily basis which is overpriced, if you just intend to take in a bit of shopping & Belfast's social seen take the train!! Like most 5* hotels upon check-in they pre authorise a sum on your credit card, however the Fitzwilliam charge double the room price & ¬£100 for extras if any items are charged to your room. We were not advised this on check-in & got a nasty surprise when we checked our bank account as we'd been charged double!!! (problem with our system was the term used i recall). Still awaiting full reimbursement. As i said this hotel has a lot going for it but a few (nasty) hidden surprises.",4,2011,11,24
226,Nice City Centre Hotel,"Spent one Friday night at the hotel while attending a show in the city with my partner.  Check in was quick and staff polite, rooms were well apportioned and comfortable, only negative comment I would have was the temperature in the room was very high even when air conditioning was on.  We had breakfast included during our stay, not a great selection of hot food items available and pricey for what was on offer.",3,2011,11,23
226,City Centre 5 Star Gem,"Stayed for two nights in this lovely hotel in November.  We waited until a room on the 7th floor was available and it didn't disappoint.  Our bed was very comfortable and our room had all the amenities you would expect from a 5 star.  The lift was directly across from our door and we didn't hear it.  We didn't use the restaurant so cannot comment.  The hotel is very central to shopping and the train station.  Staff were very friendly especially the bar staff who were very attentive. A lovely touch were the candles in our room and lovely large bath to relax in. Enjoyed a walk to the continental christmas market which was an experience! We travelled by train as we thought ¬£17 per night was just too expensive to park our car. Some outside noise (sirens) but you would expect this in a city, room absolutely spotless, will return.",5,2011,11,22
226,a jewel of a hotel in belfast,"WOW - what a luxurious and top notch hotel. it was a last minute business trip and I booked the room through Travel Republic so I didn‚Äôt know what to expect, what I didn‚Äôt expect was a doorman to take my luggage all the way to my room, or the very polite and professional front desk team. The surprises continued - I had a room on the 4th floor and it was magnificent, huge bathroom with a large tub and a wonderful power shower, fully equipped with candles and soft fluffy towels.
I ate in the bar from the Bar menu and the food was fresh and 5*. I had the confit of duck with noodles and it was delicious.
Breakfast was superb with traditional Irish locally sourced sausages and bacon and Irish breads. It was a great surprise to see smoothies made to order and they were fab.
I wish I could have relaxed over breakfast as it was very special but I had to go to work!!
A truly wonderful, high class hotel with impeccable staff, service and the best hotel food I have eaten in a very long time.  Well done Belfast",5,2011,11,21
226,Nice but noisy.,"We had an Executive Room on the sixth floor.
The room was nice but not amazing.
We had to ask for bathrobes and the minibar was empty.

We did not sleep long that night...",2,2011,11,21
226,Wonderful Stay,"The amenities offered at the hotel were very good. When I stayed, the rooms were very well cleaned and supplied. I was taken back by the bathroom as I had a choice of a bathtub or just take a shower. The staff was very helpful as well.  I did not use the pool.",4,2011,11,19
226,Nice looking hotel but thats it!,"Booked to stay at this hotel for my partners birthday for a relaxing night.  Hotel room lovely.  Until water started dripping from the ceiling, we called reception, they said they would be up.  Noone came up, we had to ring down again, the guy said he forgot???  So he came up had a look and wasnt sure.  Left it at that.  The next morning leaking again at 9.00am in morning again rang down came up and said they werent sure what it was.  We were asked on leaving how was your stay we mentioned the leak and she said oh yes!  Not once were we asked if we wanted to move rooms, i think providing that type of service is not 5 star and for the price of the rooms I would expect a lot more than what I got.  Not to mention that I was woke at 5am by nosiy air con that wasnt even from our room.  I will defo not be staying there again.  Very disappointed.",1,2011,11,18
226,Lovely hotel,"Had a lovely overnight stay at the Fitzwilliam and would definately stay again.  The room was tastefully decorated and very comfortable and had everything we needed (including an umbrella which was a bonus as it was pouring outside).

We didn't eat in the restaurant for our evening meal (although I have eaten here before and loved it).  Breakfast was delicious, made to order, fresh and hot.

The only negative is that they were having problems with the in-house movie system, so we couldn't take advantage of an offer they were doing (I think it was movie, chips and beer) but it really wasn't a big deal as we weren't planning on staying in all evening.",5,2011,11,17
226,Has Ryanair Take over Fitzwilliam Belfast II,"I seen someone else had written a review with this title and I couldnt more agree.  I have just got back from a girlie shopping weekend in Belfast.  Whilst the location was excellent for proximity to shops (5 min walk) and decor of hotel is fab, the service leaves a lot to be desired.  

Before we arrived, each time each member of our group rang to confirm booking, reception said they had no record of our booking.  There appeared to be no communication between reservartions and reception.  We arrived to be advised that there was a fee of ¬£17 per night for car parking.  We ate in the hotel restaurant the second night. The service and menu choice was very poor for a supposed 5 star hotel.  Later found out that they are 5* SELF CERTIFIED.  There was no bread served with our 3 course meal (bread was extra at a charge of ¬£2.50 per peson).   

Ther was no compimentary water in the room, no biscuts with tea making facilities.  We opened the mini bar fridge to find a half empty bottle of stale milk.  Very basic toiletries and towels No bathrope or slippers.  

At breakfast we were served 3 potsof tea which were cold and had to revert to asking for the manager to get us a hot pot of tea on the 4th attempt.

Very disappointing.  Would recommend if staying in Belfats to eat at Victoria Restaurant which is only a 2 minute walk from the hotel.  They do a pre theatre 3 course set menu for ¬£15.  Food is excellent as was service and decor....would highly recommend.",2,2011,11,13
226,Nice food I ever had....,"I had confit of duck, for my starter really nice and tasty... cooked with perfection and nice presentation... good place and fab location.. highly recommended.
Thanks.. I' ll be back soon..",5,2011,11,10
226,The best service I have ever experienced,"I stayed here in oct 2010 a year later writing the review . I have traveled around the world . I have no idea how many hotels I have stayed in . 
I received the best service ever from all staff at this hotel . 
Beautiful hotel fab fab rooms . Great location . Hope to return soon ",5,2011,11,06
226,Nice hotel Great location!!!,"We booked an executive room with a king bed ...very cosy bed an nice warm room.Our bathroom had a large shower an a bath ...only one small bar of soap one small shower gel an one small shampoo...no tissues,no body cream,towels were a bit short as well .We contacted reception an dressing gowns an slippers were delivered,In a hotel of this standard would have expected more !!! Staff at front desk very nice an helpful.If you need to have your car parked make sure you book online as its cheaper.Breakfast was good plenty of variety cooked food an continental a wide choice of teas an coffees available too..We loved this hotel an look forward to using it again..",4,2011,11,05
226,Check room type,"I booked a standard room..... This had a disabled access bathroom, not normally a problem however a nice soak in the bath was out, shower only. Also to wash your face or brush your teeth I had to kneel down due to the low level of the sink. The hand towel rail was right next to the toilet which had no lid so when flushing it could splash onto your face towels. There was no shelf in the shower to put shampoo etc on. When booking I'd advise you ask whether it is a disabled bathroom otherwise upgrade to an executive room if available. My minibar was filthy, it smelt of rotten milk and had left over food in from the previous guest, they did come and re-stock when asked but didn't clean it. Tray charge for room service was a whopping ¬£10 which is the most I have ever been charged. Dinner was delicious apart from my cold vegetables which were uncovered on the trolley. This is 5 star and normally excellent, just not a great experience this time.",4,2011,11,04
226,"Trip to Belfast, 10/16/11","The Fitzwilliam Hotel is in a great location close to City Center.  We were able to walk to most places within the city.  What we couldn't walk to, we were able to easily hail a cab.  The rooms were clean and nicely decorated.  The beds were very, very comfortable and the rooms very quiet (which I like--my sister thought it was too quiet and asked for a fan, which she was  promptly provided with).  The staff at the hotel were very helpful.  Some staff in the bar area could have been a little more outgoing/cordial; however, it was a very busy bar scene and staff were kept on their toes.  The lobby was beautiful and cozy--I particularly liked how you felt you were part of the city when you were in the lobby because of its floor to ceiling windows and the nice seating-gas fireplace which made you feel warm the minute you walked in from the street.  Breakfast was included with our room which consisted of eggs, bacon, ham, muffins, cold cereal, fruits, juices, coffee, tea and a variety of toasts--which was great!  My only disappointment was their restaurant for dinner.  The modern chairs, although interesting to look at, were not that comfortable.  The food was expensive and not that great.  I got lamb for dinner which was good; however, it was just lamb, there was no starch or vegetable---that was all ala carte (of which we were not aware).  For the dinner prices, we expected more.  Additionally, I got an after dinner Port which was a few pounds more expensive than it was, for the same exact Port at another restaurant we visited.  I will review the restaurants for my trip in the appropriate area of Tripadvisor.  As far as hotels go, I would go back to the Fitzwilliam Hotel and I highly recommend it.",4,2011,10,31
226,Average hotel,"Just back from a night in the Fitzwilliam with my husband and I agree with alot of the poor reviews, basic sundries not even a cotton wool pad, I have had more sundries in a basic hotel. None of the extras that you would associate with a hotel of this grade.
 We ordered bread and olives before our main meal and were enjoying these when a waiter arrived with our main course when we were only really started to enjoy the breads.
My main meal had cold potatoes and the rest was very average,it was obvious that I had eaten very little but the waiter did not comment.
Breakfast was also just ok, may I suggest that hotels get back to a cooked breakfast to order?
Again I have stayed at 10 Square and will be returning there in the furture.
location is good and bathroom spacious but cocktails expensive!",3,2011,10,31
226,Another great stay!,"Great hotel: great location: great food:great staff: room decor is ok.

I love this hotel.",5,2011,10,31
226,Has Ryanair taken over the Fitzwilliam?,"¬£10 charge for room service tray and ¬£16.50 for a glass of house chardonnay within the same order. Extortionate! Absolutely basic level of sundries in the room. One bath and one hand towel, no bathrobe, no complimentary water or biscuit with tea tray. One bath gel and one shampoo. No conditioner, no body lotion, no tissues in room. Minimum tv channels and ¬£10 charge for WIFI. I've stayed several times on business but with charges like these I won't be back.There are plenty good alternatives in Belfast.",3,2011,10,30
226,Top class hotel,"Everything you expect from a 5 star. Amazing service from reception, concierge, to the staff over breakfast. Rooms spacious, quiet and comfy. Like the mirrors on the outside of the doors-you can check yourself as you leave! 

Breakfast is incredible. If you have b&b package you can have whatever you want-including things off the menu-like eggs benadict etc. however if you didn't have this package the prices are outrageously expensive, so try to get a b&b package. We did so off alpharooms.com 

One tip-make sure you have a credit card-they take a swipe of this as a deposit & use against damage & mini bar. Concerning the minibar do not take out anything unless you actually plan to consume it. They have automatic sensors that debit your account if you remove anything from it. ",5,2011,10,30
226,A let down of gigantic proportions,"This hotel was recommended by a close friend. The location is excellent but although the service is ok it should be alot better for the price being charged. I dined in the bar and had their express lunch while waiting for my room.  First impressions were not good. The fish and chips tasted soggy and like it was microwaved food. When I complained the apology from the waitress was sincere and raised my hopes for the hotel.  The room while clean was very ok and not much more, I dined in the restaurant as it was the main reason for my visit.  The fennel soup was salty and stringy.  The beef was cold and tough when I got it. I sent it back and the second was no better. After this I left and ate at ten square it is to be recommended the hotel is second rate and there is better food out of a dog can than is available here. ",2,2011,10,28
226,Putting on the Ritz at the fitz!!,"My wife and I were invited to the Fitzwilliam last Friday night courtesy of one of my suppliers, we were going to an awards dinner elsewhere then staying in the Fitz for the night.
  Check in was pleasant (as you would expect) the room was lovely , clean spacious and with some nice little extras (music system,mini bar, sofa etc).
 The kingsize bed was very comfy, and breakfast the next morning was a very satisfying buffet style, with loads of choice ( nice croissants).
 Looking forward to our next visit , it was that nice I will even pay for it!!",5,2011,10,27
226,"Great hotel, perfectly located","We arrived at the hotel at 1000 on a Friday morning. From the moment we arrived we were allowed to relax -  from the reception and the concierge, it was all stress free. 
Comfortable rooms, comfortable bathrooms, great bar. 
We paid for breakfast but never made it - I blame the bar staff for being so good ‚ò∫‚ò∫ üëçüëçüëçüëçüëç
",5,2011,10,25
226,Excellent hotel and Food,"I have stayed here on various occasions 2010-2011 and it has been excellent every time- I have also been upgraded twice which is always an incentive to go back. The room are comfortable and a good size some of them with lovely views of the bustling city. The location is also excellent bring right in the centre and minutes from the shops, restaurants, cinema and the hall. I ate here a few times and it was always excellent and reasonable value for a hotel although there are many other more eateries around which constitute better value for money. Cleanliness is also of a high standard and noise was never a problem (from outside or other rooms) Definitely one of my top two hotels in Belfast (the other being The Merchant)",5,2011,10,25
226,really good location,i stayed here for 2 nights and found the location to be the hotels main attraction. staff were friendly and breakfast was good. bar service was very slow . room was clean . overall i would stay again due to location,4,2011,10,24
226,perfect choice,"i picked this hotel based on tripadvisor reviews and i was very happy with the choice.  it is a modern, pleasant and clean hotel.  And the location - just perfect, right in the city center.   We paid extra for parking, but it was worth it as the hotel has it own secure parkade.",5,2011,10,19
226,Really disappointing,"My partner and I stayed here for two nights, and I'm sorry to say it was not a positive experience. 

This hotel is one of two 5 star establishments in Belfast, and I really don't believe it deserves those five stars. 

The reception area is pleasant, and check-in was swift, friendly and efficient and we were allowed to check in early which was great start. 

The problems began when we got in the lift, which looked like it hadn't been hoovered in over a week. Upon arriving in the room, the decor was ok but the furniture was cheap (and I mean cheap) and covered in chips and marks.The extractor fan in the bathroom was caked in dirt and dust.  Just not good enough for a hotel purporting to be of this quality. 

We complained to the manager, who was really apologetic and very helpful. They changed our room which was better but the furniture was as bad as it was in the last room. It urgently needs updating/replacing (and replacing with better quality stuff). 

Other problems - bar service was just awful. We ordered drinks in the lobby which still hadn't arrived after 40 minutes. Eventually they came, and there was no charge, but there is no excuse for taking this long to prepare a few cocktails. Later that night, we ordered more drinks which didn't show up at all. When we went to get them ourselves, one was served in a glass with a huge chip which was just not acceptable in a 5 star hotel. 

The hotel desperately needs more staff in the bar/lobby. If you're going to trade as a cocktail bar then make sure you have the staff to keep up with demand, or else don't serve cocktails in the first place. A key part of a 5 star experience is service and that was sadly lacking during our stay. 

On a positive note - breakfast was great, fresh and hot with good quality ingredients and a wide variety of items both on the buffet and on the menu. 

Sadly this won't be enough to make us return the next time we're in town.",2,2011,10,19
226,Styaed 7 nights and would stay again for certain,"Yes this hotel is dark but I am told that this is by design as darkened corridors allegedly cause guests to be quiet when walking through as it simulates night time ! It seems to work as I have never stayed in such a quiet room and rarely heard anybody else depite being on the 3rd floor and mid corridor. 
The room was lovely, large and well equipped. Just a few things let it down apart from being quite dark. The plugs were all in the wrong place for any mirrors (being female this meant problems with hair drying), the tea and coffee service was nowhere near any plugs so you had to boil the kettle elsewhere and then carry it. The shelf above the sink in the bathroom was the only shelf and it was tiny. There were no tissues, complimetary water or biscuits which i would expect in a 5 star business hotel.  The bed was lovely, large with loads of pillows !!
Otherwise it was a pleasant experience and I will be returning without any concerns later this year. 
Great location for exploring Belfast too.",4,2011,10,18
226,You have to stay here if you like modern and hip,"Stayed here for work but OMG, it was reasonably priced, so city and chic!!",5,2011,10,16
226,Decor by The Munsters,"This is a boutique hotel. these days, the word ""Boutique"" means quirky, so this hotel has gone for quirky decor. As in BLACK decor. 

Lighting levels in corridors are so low i thought war had broken out and energy was being rationed.As you enter your room, the entrance is BLACK. Admittedly the rest of the room is nicely decorated, but small enough to decapitate the cat as you swing it. Rooms are very clean and beds are very comfortable, so it is not all bad. 

Still, the bathroom is well apointed, with separate batha nd shower, but the decor is (yes, you guessed it) BLACK.

Whoever told the hotel taht guests like their rooms BLACK, was misinformed. Only funeral directors like black, and thy are fairly sick of it.

Anyway, on to other things - Breakfast. The hot food, when it finally arrived, was good. Unfortunately, although breakfast is served from 7am, the hot food only started to appear at 7.20am. By that time there was a large number of people all wanting to get to the food first, so it created a bit of a bun fight. There is no excuse for this - if breakfast starts at 7.00, then get prepared for it in advance. Otherwise, just tell us it's 7.30, but don't keep up hanging about like fools.

Reception staff are very pleasant and efficient. Valet parking is available at EUR17 per night, which is actually very reasonable, as you are right in the middle of Belfast (which, incidentally is a beautiful city and well worth a visit).

In sumary? Well it's a good hotel, but nowhere near as good as it thinks it is.",3,2011,10,10
226,lovely hotel,"Beautiful hotel the decor and ambience is lovely, loads of candles and lights in the lobby at night really nice to sit and have few drinks, french martinis are delicious.  No complaints at all room spotless, lovely breakfast no queues at all.  Staff were really pleasant and when i rang about leaving something in my room was posted out in next couple of days! :) One downside is only one space in front of hotel to pull car in def could do with few more, and also road noise in morning was terrible ended up getting up at 8am.",5,2011,10,10
226,"Nice, hip and central.","The first clues to the Fitzwilliam hip status came as we got off a taxi at the entrance and were greeted by a mob of teenagers asking:  ‚Äúare you with her?‚Äù As it turns out ‚Äúher‚Äù was singer Rihana who was staying also at the hotel during her Belfast concerts.  Good choice. The hotel is certainly hip without been pretentious; the lobby is contemporary but not cold. The rooms are spacious and well appointed. The staff attentive and courteous (they politely rejected to give us any information about their celebrity or any other guests).  The restaurant is trendy and serves nice eclectic fare. Their location is a short walk from most attractions including the troubled West Belfast district where most of the confrontations took place years ago, but where we were greeted by friendly neighbors and children playing outdoors as we walked by taking pictures of the old war murals. Yes, Belfast has come a long way.",4,2011,10,07
226,Beautiful but not five star,"yes this is a beautiful building and you can see that the owners take pride in the appearance both inside and outside. BUT it has some fundamental issues that I would not expect from a 5 Star hotel.
The restaurant staff are far from 5 star standard and quite intrusive during a meal.
Our room was not cleaned properly and we couldn't be sure if the sheets were fresh or just straightened up after the previous guest.... a long hair just under the top of the comforter is what gave rise to this suspicion. I mentioned it on checkout but she just looked at me as if I was just saying it to get discount and dismissed it.
Those few negatives aside, it is a beautiful hotel and could easily achieve the 5 Star perception",4,2011,10,05
226,Beautiful hotel but overpriced,"I stayed for two nights with friends and the staff and decor are fantastic. However, breakfast let them down initially which was then rescued by the staff. On the first morning bread had started to go mouldy, long waits for buffet foods (fresh cooking slowed things down - ? 5 star) eventually delivered to table by friendly waitress which would have further delayed food going to the buffet. 2nd morning even slower and toasters not working. Definitely needs improvement. We had a cocktail session which was fab, let down by very sticky, drink covered marble fronted bar - good clean needed. And, one of the cocktail drinks was ""off"". Rescued by Andy - excellent mixologist!  

Pros - very friendly staff, lovely room, beautiful decor, heart of city, quiet room at back of hotel
Cons - breakfast",3,2011,10,05
226,Nice but noisy,"The hotel is very modern and the rooms are decorated beautifully. They are also spacious and well maintained. The set menu for the two course meal included as part of our stay offered 4 good choices for each course and the food was very nicely cooked. The hotel is centrally located and is an ideal base for exploring the city or shopping.  It also offers concierge parking for ¬£15 p.n. The only negative about the hotel is the noise caused by the constant flow of traffic outside (it is on the junction of 2 main streets and the executive room that we stayed in was on one such side).  Even with the window closed the traffic noise is clearly audible and makes it very difficult to get a good nights sleep. That aside, it is a beautiful hotel with very friendly staff.",4,2011,10,03
226,great location but over priced,"I stayed for two nights. The location is great. The staff were friendly but the prices were off the wall. A pint and a half were over ¬£13, thats mad. The charge for parking is ¬£17 a night and the second night we discovered that our car was on the street and not on secure parking like we had been told and they tried to charge us. We asked for drinks to be brought to our room and were told that they were too busy and we ordered a newspaper to be delievered to our room butit never arrived. I did enjoy my stay but next time I will try another hotel in the same location",3,2011,10,03
226,Beautiful modern hotel in the city centre.. few glitches though..,"I recently spent three nights at the Fitzwilliam for business and the bedroom and bathroom was truly beautiful. Rihanna was staying there in the Penthouse during my visit which gives you an idea of the class of hotel that it is. 

However I will quickly get the couple of negatives out of the way, these took it down form a rating of five to four. I was woken up at 7.30am on Saturday morning by a wake up call when I had asked for 9.45am and more than that, I had double checked when it was for in the system the night before to make sure I wasn't woken up too early on my ""lie in"" morning. Ironically as I was on the phone to reception complaining about this a maid walked into the room without knocking, she almost saw me naked! There were a few cleanliness issues too, a long black hair in the bath and some unidentified gloop stuck in the sink that was only removed after a couple of cleans. In my room 611 someone had obviously spilt a large amount of liquid on the floor at the foot of the bed giving the carpet a cracking strange sound and feel when you walk on it. 

Apart from this I had a fantastic stay, the rooms and hotel is very modern and the bathroom fantastic, with a large wet area and shower and a sepearate bath that came with candles to help a relaxing soak. The staff were all super friendly and chatty and the location could not be faulted, right in the city centre, you could walk to all the bars and restaurants from there. I don't think the qulity of the breakfast was amazing but it was just about okay for the ¬£12. Anyway I will definitely stay at this hotel again.",4,2011,10,03
226,True find,"I honestly can not fault this hotel. Location is great, funky design, good food in the restaurant and the room was big, clean and well maintained. Highly recommend it to anyone visiting, and definitely more charming than your average chain hotel.",5,2011,09,30
226,Nice but not 5-Star,"My wife and I enjoyed our two day stay here in July.  The hotel is very central and everything in Belfast is within walking distance.  Finding parking, on arrival, can be difficult: there is one recessed space available outside the hotel so if that is occupied you might have to park on the path.  (Valet Parking is available, if expensive, at ¬£17 per day.)  We were met by Philip, a very friendly and welcoming concierge who carried our bags to reception and after checking in (receptionist was somewhat jaded and lacked any enthusiasm), to our room.
When we exited the lift we were struck by the darkness of the corridors: don‚Äôt know the reason for this, but it could be difficult for people with sight problems.  Our room was a typical ‚Äúblock‚Äù room ‚Äì an Executive Room on 7th floor - clean, decorated in muted colours with a view of the city skyline. 
There was a safe for valuables (it was locked by the previous occupant but a call to reception quickly had it opened ) and an ironing board (not on holidays thanks). There were no robes, although the information booklet claimed that robes were available.  The bathroom houses separate bath and shower units (shower can be very slippery).  More storage space/shelf at the sink would be helpful.  
Tea and coffee making facilities are provided.  Pay-per-view movies are also available and a CD player/Radio is hidden in a press.
We enjoyed a cocktail and other drinks in the bar where service was professional and friendly.  The foyer was bright and attractive with a warm fire, couches and a library.
We had one dinner in the restaurant, which was ok but nothing memorable: the same setting is used for breakfast too, but with a buffet layout.  We didn‚Äôt expect a breakfast buffet in a 5 star hotel: we visited a 3 Star hotel recently that provided breakfast cooked to order.  With a buffet breakfast food (especially eggs) can continue cooking and can be there for hours.  
The only outstanding memory of the dinner was that the waiter didn‚Äôt know how to pour wine properly: he failed to allow for the drips which ran down the side of the bottle, making it impossible to hold the bottle without getting wine on your hands and there was also a nice red ring left on the table.  I had to use my own tissue to clean the table and the bottle.  The waiter also replaced the top on the bottle, something I had never seen before ‚Äì I thought that wine should be left to breathe.  So some staff training is necessary. There are many very good/great restaurants nearby that should be considered in preference to the hotel restaurant.
At breakfast, a young blonde waitress was exceptionally efficient and friendly.
I would not rate the hotel as 5 Star but many of the staff are very friendly and professional.  We had moved here directly from The Merchant Hotel so maybe that coloured our expectations and experience at the Fitzwilliam.",3,2011,09,29
226,Pretty good value in the heart of Belfast,"We enjoyed a 3 night stay at the Fitzwilliam.  It's location is outstanding and the price we obtained was very good value, indeed.  The room was spacious enough with excellent bathroom facilities, although the shower cubicle surface becomes treacherous when wet.  The bed was very firm but I like that, others might not.  The staff were very good and the young concierge was particularly helpful in doing some detective work re an incorrect phone number I had obtained.  His help was invaluable as it was important to me.
The hotel is within very easy walking distance of everything that lovely Belfast city has to offer.  I would definitely stay again.",4,2011,09,28
226,Fabulous,We stayed in this hotel with our 2 and a half year old daughter....she had a great time and all the staff fussed over her which she loved!! Our room was very comfortable and the bathroom was lovely....I would highly recommend this hotel and will be returning very soon!,5,2011,09,27
226,Very pleasant stay !,I went with my nephew and had a pleasant stay. Friendly staff. It was a  good room that had all and more than I required. The breakfast was delicious maybe a bit too delicious.,5,2011,09,25
226,"horrible hotel, I've slept more comfortably on a sofa.","I was really looking forward to staying in this hotel after reading all the great reviews. Unfortunately, I have to say it was all very disappointing. My bed was rock hard and uncomfortable. At one point I felt tempted to sleep on the sofa in my room there thinking it might be more comfortable. I didn't get ANY sleep there at all. Also, the deco in the room was pretty ghastly, lime green furniture that one might purchase from a junk shop or find abandoned on a street. Also, the lighting in the corridors was so dim the whole time (trying to create an ambience? or save on lighting?) - it eventually just irritated me along with pretty much everything else about this hotel. One positive - the bathroom was nice. Also, the location was fantastic.  but that's all.  the hotel itself, not my cup of tea.",1,2011,09,24
226,Loved it!!!,"My partner and I booked this at last minute one night just for a wee treat to ourselves , the place was spotless and the room was beautiful very much enjoyed our stay and would definately go back",5,2011,09,20
226,"Excellent location, nice hotel, but not the best 5* I've ever seen","Location is excellent, within walking distance to several points of interest, in a safe area during the night. Rooms and bathrooms have a nice decor, and the bed was really comfortable, but the shower was not very powerful. Staff is friendly and helpful.
Breakfast was ok. The food was not outstanding, and it got a little crowded so they were always running out of clean glasses, plates, eggs or anything.
If breakfast left much to be desired, dinner was amazingly good. The restaurant is in the Michelin guide and their food was surprisingly good; it is definitely worth to have dinner that.",4,2011,09,20
226,"Great location, but that's all.","We booked into the Fitzwilliam for a night out in Belfast. Initial impression was of frienfly staff and a pleasantly decorated and welcoming lobby, apart from the tiles in the lift area - 1970's school cloakroom variety. When we went up to our room, we discovered it was really very small (other hotels we have stayed in in Belfast city centre had much better sized rooms - Hilton, Jury's, Radisson, Holiday Inn)  and the decor is grey and unappealing. Our room was a disabled access room (with large open plan bathroom, (shower room really) disabled toilet and shower and a tiny, small cloakroom size sink which was very low down, so,  as we didn't need disabled facilities, we phoned down to reception to enquire were told that all rooms of this category, ""Standard Rooms"", are disabled access. The person we spoke to did nopt ask if we would like to upgrade to another category of room.  The trouble is that we were not told this when booking - there is no mention of it on the Fitzwilliam website room description. 
The size and decor of the room and the dimly lit hallways togather with the fact that it seems to be not possible to fully open the curtains and see out the window (there are the main curtains which open) but also a thin gauze type lining which we couldn't seem to open creates an overall feeling of claustraphobia.
Next morning, we went down to the restaurant for breakfast but discovered that the restaurant has no windows at all and again felt small, hot  and claustraphobic so we decided to check-out and went for breakfast to a little cafe nearby instead.",2,2011,09,18
226,Service,"I have never written a review before, but having just left this hotel I am so annoyed at the disappointing service that I felt the need to reord my considerable disappoitnment at the poor service in this over priced, alleged 5 star hotel.",3,2011,09,17
226,Shaky start but generally a good stay,"check-in time was 2 but when we tried to check in by three we were told it would be a couple of minutes, that the people before had had a late check-out.  We did not get our room until 4.  When I checked out I queried this and I was told they would never have let anyone stay on a busy day and the receptionsist was so shirty.  I believe in a hotel of this level better is necessary.
Overall the room was lovely, the service including room service good.  
We had breakfast in the restaurant on the last day - there were not enough glasses for orange juice and over a period of 30 minutes only one slice of bacon - even though my husband commented at the start of this period.
Concierge service was good though I was told Deane's had two Michellin stars and when I looked it up on via michellin they had lost their star.",4,2011,09,16
226,Probably the worst 5* hotel in the world,"We stayed for 3 sleepless nights in an unbearably noisy room. For what claims to be 5* ,I was amazed that there were holes in the duvet cover. Also dirty cups wre left after cleaning.The shower was seriously under-powered.
As for breakfast, it was the worst we have ever had in Belfast. This was not helped by the staff clearing our table whilst we were getting our food. It then took over 10 mins to get our tea and coffee back.",1,2011,09,16
226,Great location/good value,"The decor of this hotel is what strikes you first,the rooms are decorated fantastically,the only problem is the poorly lit hallways but its not a major problem.the rooms are cleaned daily and the staff are all very helpful.the hotel is close to all amenities victoria square/main shopping area & the opera house is just next door.the rate are very reasonable too.",5,2011,09,13
226,Excellent value in the heart of the city,"We stayed on a room only basis so can only comment on that aspect of the hotel.  For us, the location was excellent and it was well worth paying extra for the valet parking.  The staff were friendly and helpful and the decor great.  The room was large and superbly furnished with an extra comfy bed.  This hotel does what it says on the tin so I could only award a 5 star rating.  Will not look elsewhere when returning to the area as exceptional value at the rate we paid.",5,2011,09,13
226,Superior customer service,"Great location within walking distance of central Dublin. Room was a disabled room (we were asked when booking if we would accept this type of room) - this seems to mean more floor space but only one bed, and a large ""shower room"" style bathroom. While I did not see the regular room, this one definitely was suitable for us. The hotel was very well maintained and had a lovely lobby, with a gas fireplace in a library area. We were able to avail of a third night free option to mkae it more affordable. However, like many five star hotels, the dining seemed pricy so we ate elsewhere (the famous Crown bar is just across the street and had wonderful food at a reasonable cost). The real distincton for me was the concierge service that was provided, in advance of our arrival. Via prompt and informative email correspondance, the concierge was able to assist in our transportation bookings and saved us money on rail fares. We would highly recommend this hotel.",5,2011,09,12
226,Great service and location,"The Fitzwilliam was really lovely and right in Belfast. The staff were attentive and the pre-booked valet service was great. The room was comfortable and the decor was fresh and funky. The cleaning service was wonderful, our room was always immaculate when we returned from our days out. The staff were always willing to offer advice on where to go and things to see. I really enjoyed my visit to Belfast and this hotel played a huge part in that. The biggest plus for this hotel is its location. My pet peeve is when a hotel is ages away from everything, however, The Fitzwilliam is in a great spot, only a short walk away from shopping etc...",5,2011,09,12
226,USED to be best hotel.....,"Having stayed in this hotel on many occassions before, I am utterly appalled at the level of service offered.  This hotel was our fav hotel of all times and had no doubts about returning to it for a night in Belfast.  However, we were extremely disappointed.  To start we had paid ¬£170 for an upgraded superior room for a change....it was worse than the standard rooms at ¬£140 per night.

Our stay went like this:
- No morning papers offered at reception upon check-in.
- No 'welcome back **GUEST**' on TV screen when we entered our room.
- Only 2 pillows on bed - 1 spare in cupboard.
- Complimentary toiletries - 1 tiny bar of soap to share and no conditioner.
- No 'turn-down' service when we arrived back to our room at night.
- No complimentary bottled water in room. 
- Breakfast delivered late apparently due to 'large order' - 2 persons.
- No milk delivered with cereal. 
- No late check-out.

The hotel seriously needs to look at its services offered....there may well be a recession where cutting unnecessary costs is essential but despite this they need to remember that returning guests remember the services previously availed of and expect these when they repeat their visit.",3,2011,09,12
226,"Fantastic staff, Great location, Great hotel","This was our first trip to Belfast and we were lucky to have stayed in such a great hotel. The staff have to rank as the best anyone could wish for, nothing was too much trouble. The receptionists were all welcoming and polite and very helpful; the waiters in the bar and the restaurant did that little ""bit more"" which enhanced our dining experience. Special thanks has to go to the concierge who arranged our very interesting taxi tour of the Falls and Shankill areas. The room was modern and spacious and very comfortable. Great stay.",5,2011,09,10
226,Hotel Great. No sure about automatic Charity Doanation,"The room and service were great, comfy beds, quiet at night, good bathroom. 
Corridors were very, very, dark. But maybe that's to make people be silent as the use them!

Only real issue was the bill that was popped under the door in the morning. Hotel room rate and a ¬£1 charity donation. Then list as Total Balance to Pay.
I went to reception and asked to check out, receptionist asked ""had I got the bill""? ""Yes"" I said. ""Was everything OK"". she said. ""Yes, the room was great"" I said. ""Did you fully read the Bill"" she finally said!

Adding charity donations to an hotel bill, however well meaning is so wrong on so many levels.
No mention of what the charity was, would I even support it? 
I was told it could be removed and it would be ""no problem""

Put a collection box at reception by all means but don't add it to the account.

Other gripe. I rang to get the post code for my sat nav as it wasn't on the e-mail from the Hotel?? I also asked is there parking? I was told there was hotel valet parking. I asked were they any public car parks nearby? No, I was told. 
Tip to receptionist, look out of window across the road there is a secure public car park!",3,2011,09,08
226,fabulous hotel in a fabulous location!,"just back from a 2 night break in belfast and what can I say but wow,contemporary entrance, friendly staff,we arrived at the hotel at 10am,aware that we couldn't check in till 2pm,but the reception staff were friendly and efficient and had a room available so we were able to check in an explore the city minus our luggage! the room was clean and spacious with a huge bed,sitting area and all the amenities that you expect from a 5* hotel. great value for money,the hotel was also ruuning a promotion for evening meal 3 course dinner for 2 with a bottle of wine for ¬£50,and the foof was first class,overall an enjoyable and relaxing experience in a wonderful hotel. we will be back !",5,2011,09,06
226,The best hotel in Belfast.,"I honestly couldn't fault this hotel. We've stayed in about 6 different hotels in Belfast and this is by far the best. The rooms are beautiful. Immaculately clean and have everything you might need- iron, mini bar, tv, cooffe/ tea, stereo. The shower is huge! The staff couldn't do enough for us, very friendly and helpful- they even ordered a Chinese for us and brought it to our room after our night out. Add to all this the great location and you have everything you need for an amazing getaway. Can't wait to go back. ",5,2011,09,05
226,We LOVED IT!,"Our Stay at the Fitzwilliam was one of the highlights of our trip to Ireland!. The Staff was Fantastic!. The Concierge was extremely friendly and attentive.  The Room was out of this world!. We had the most amazing View!!. The Shower was SOO Huge, you could fit 10 people in it.  Truly one of the best hotel experiences EVER!.",5,2011,09,01
226,excellent allround!!,"stayed before a concert,train station right beside,taxis round the corner!excellent executive room,with flat tv,stereo,bath and also a seperate massive shower area,lovely modern day decor,comfotable bed! couch in window, and lovely food in downstairs bar and excellent service.,,would definitely stay again:)",5,2011,08,30
226,"Love this hotel, have stayed here lots of times and will stay again","great location, great staff, welcoming and friendly. rooms are so well equipped, with coffee maker, wine glasses, mini bar, stereo, candles etc etc, everything you need!
The reception area is luxurious with candles lit at night",5,2011,08,30
226,Great anniversary made complete by this hotel!,"we stayed at the hotel on the 22nd August 2011, from the moment we stepped through the hotel doors we were greated by friendly staff, the Concierge (i think his name was phillip) was very welcoming and did all in his power to assist!!  the rooms where fantastic and the dinner was something I have never tasted in my life!!!! it was a delight to behold!! Many thanks for the stay and we will be there again!!!",5,2011,08,30
226,Sooooooo....not 5*,"Arriving @ the hotel we were indeed greeted by friendly staff. But upon entering the room was disappointed. The last occupants magazine was still in the bin. Next morning we found that the mini-bar had not been restocked with still water. For a ""Superior King"" room it was verging on empty , no biscuits on the tea tray ,not even a box of tissues in the bathroom. Even the most basic of hotels have these. When the curtains were pulled next morning I found a hole in the voile covering the window. When you have a 5* rating attention to detail is very important. This time last year we stayed in the ""Merchant Hotel"" for 2 nights, now that is a 5* hotel.. ""Fitzwilliam Hotel"" you need to go there & see how it's done in style @ the moment I wouldn't recommend you too anyone. Very average 3-4*. On a more positive note the staff were indeed very friendly and pleasant.",3,2011,08,30
226,This was a birthday treat for my wife and boy did we enjoy it..worth every penny,"Room was amazing .ideally situated for  evening events such as the opera house,and local well known venues.The views from ourroom were amazing as well.

Check your bill carefully though as we wre charged twice for mini bar and did noy useit,,but this was quickly rectified by receptionist along with apology...apart from this one blip if you want the best of everything then The Fitzwilliam is the place to go.....",5,2011,08,30
226,The air conditioning issue spoilt our stay,"We recently stayed at the Fitzwilliam Hotel for two nights in one of the suites on the eigth floor.  The staff were fantastic, particularly Kris the concierge, and Rachel on reception. Every request was met with a smile, and I haven't experienced such service in a very long time. The hotel was perfectly situated close to the city centre & is immediately adjacent the Belfast Theartre. The one major issue for me was the air-conditioning which was extremely noisy and ineffective, a problem I wouldn't expect to find in a 5 star hotel. A further problem for us on the eigth floor was that they had  installed a supplementary air conditioning generator/compressor above our room which ran from 8 am to 10 pm ( apparently in an attempt to resolve the air conditioning problem ),& which completely spoilt our stay. I was given a 10% reduction on the room rate after complaining, but had I been forewarned of the issue beforehand I would have booked one of the standard rooms on a lower floor, or chose a different hotel.",4,2011,08,29
226,Contemporary Design but not 4 star restaurant,"As a surprise my husband booked a night in The Fitzwilliam.  We stayed previously and were looking forward to relaxation and exploring Belfast from our central location.   We arrived and they could not find our reservation initially.....5+ mins later. Lunch in the bar was very nice, staff were efficient and cordial. Our room was art deco, bright and welcoming and very comfortable, just as we remembered. All normal factilites available apart from the white bath robes and a hairdryer (which I thought were a norm) had to be requested from reception!. (They arrived at our room the next morning with the bath robes at 8.30am!!!) We decided to dine in the restaurant at 8pm but it was busy so it was 8.30pm.   There was a ¬£50 deal for Dinner and Wine p.p but we chose the A la Carte as we did not want all the courses.  We had Garlic & Fennel Veloute (soup) which was tasty and the Asparagus with Hens egg was quite tasteless. The food, well presented but bland, at those prices and with Kevin Thornton's reputation, we had high expectations. We were told we did not need to order a side of potatoes as they would come with the fish, however both of us were nearly finished our main courses when they arrived.  The restaurant was fairly busy but it appeared that waiters moved between all tables.  We stared at our glasses on 2 occasions - they were empty! It is very annoying that the ice bucket is at the entrance of the restaurant, not at the table.   Overall, we found the food service poor and expensive, not 4 star hotel standard.  We decided not to have breakfast as we recalled it was very overpriced for what we received the last time we stayed. We would recommend staying at the hotel for its locaction and contemporary rooms but go to The Europa next door for dinner or Cafe Nero next to bus station for breakfast.",3,2011,08,28
226,Wonderful hotel with friendly staff and lovely rooms,"This is now my ""go-to"" hotel for travel to Belfast.  It benefits from a nicer clientele than the Europa (which is around the corner) and has a lovely bar area where drink-making is an art!  The rooms are very comfortable, with extremely spacious bathrooms as well.  One of the best attributes is the lack of any sound disturbances.  I have had the best nights' sleep at the Fitzwilliam of any hotel I've visited in Belfast.  I have to return frequently for business and the location of this property is also ideal.  Very convenient to the city centre and only about a 15 minute taxi ride from the City airport.  Breakfast buffet is also quite nice, with a wide variety of hot and cold items.  Excellent experience - you won't go wrong here.",5,2011,08,28
226,4*++++ Bloody good deal.,"Great hotel,fantastic location and excellent FOH staff. Bar staff need to be just as attentive to their non cocktail drinking customers. Although saying that the cocktails did look amazing. The main reason for the downgrade from a 5* is mainly due to down to the hotel being a couple of years old and starting to look a bit jaded around the edges. The main corridor on 4th floor smelled a tad musty.It can be a bit noisy due to traffic but to be fair it is on a busy main road. Really handy for the main bus station so getting from and to the airport is really easy. Good bars and restaurants all within walking distance. Also hotel bar reasonably priced if you like drinking pints.",5,2011,08,23
226,Outstanding service and facilities,"Just a quick make sure your car is clean as the conceirge service will have your car off you at the door and a muck filled car can be embarrasing.

The location is perfect for everything in belfast all in walking distance even for women in heels

The staff just simply seem to appear when you need them and i recon if you asked them to bend over backwards and juggle they would do it with a smile on there face outstanding service.

The rooms are second to none and the beds could sleep 12 .

Its a great hotel well priced has all you need and more i took my girlfriend there after her graduation and def got me brownie points.

If you are looking to impress and not break the bank i def would reccommend this hotel after staying in quite a few around belfast

Simply outstanding and breakfast is top notch if you can think of it you can have it . 

Ill be back

",5,2011,08,21
226,Amazing Room,We had the most amazing room at this hotel when we stayed in June.  It was a corner suite with a wrap around window.  The bath opened up to the living room complete with candles for added atmosphere.  Those doors are closable for a more private bath when needed.  The hotel is close to many attractions and was where we wanted to be in Belfast.  The breakfast was fine but nothing adventurous.  The bar seemed busy and fairly noisy (the sign of a happy bar) the one time I was in there.,4,2011,08,21
226,Excellent location and stellar service--really enjoyed our stay!,"From our arrival and cheerful greeting (we welcomed the suggestions on what to do on our first day) by the desk staff, to our checkout, the courteous service was truly five star! The lobby and sitting area are welcoming and attractive. The bar and dining areas are comfortable and well-decorated and the food and service excellent (delicious Irish breakfast, too)! Our accommodation was luxurious, spacious and sparkling clean! Every detail was addressed, including the in-room coffee/tea/hot chocolate provisions. We appreciate the advice and arrangements made by the concierge, Gerrard, who we feel went above and beyond to book our tour to The Giant's Causeway and to suggest how we could get to Donegal by having us met in Derry by Martin McCrossan of Martin McCrossan's Award Winning City Tours, where we enjoyed an informative and entertaining walking tour by John, then driven to Donegal by Dermott, also from Martin McCrossan's Award Winning City Tours, providing background and commentary on the way. Great stay in Belfast, looking forward to returning!",5,2011,08,21
226,"Fantastic stay, and fantastic food in a great location.","We loved this hotel.  The food in the restaurant was fabulous, both dinner and breakfast was delicious.  I travelled with my Son who is a very picky eater and for the first time in his life devoured every course.  That is a compliment in itself! 
The reception staff were very courteous and helpful and the room was lovely and absolutely spotless, with very nice bathroom facilities.  I liked the added touch of the candle on the bath.  
The location is great, right next to the Opera house and Gt Victoria train station. 
I would definitely be back.  We had the Dinner/Bed/Breakfast package for two which was excellent value.",5,2011,08,21
226,Wouldn't rush back,Having stayed at The Merchant Hotel previously which is also a 5 star I was expecting something similar and was really looking forward to my stay at The Fitzwilliam Hotel.  The Merchant Hotel is definately more luxurious and had the wow factor for us.  I have also stayed at a number of other 4 stars hotels in Belfast.  There were a few things which disappointed me about The Fitzwilliam Hotel.  Firstly there were no biscuits provided with tea tray which I thought was a poor reflection for a 5 star hotel.  I contacted reception and was told that biscuits were not provided.  Secondly I found the breakfast disappointing.  It was buffet style.  The potato bread was very soggy and greasy.  Bacon was also cold and sausages were not good quality.  At The Merchant Hotel sausages are sourced from famous NI butchers `McCartneys' and a cooked breakfast is waiter service.  No comment cards were available at The Fitzwilliam.  The en suite  shower had quite poor water pressure.  On a positive note I found the staff friendly and room spotless.  For the amount we paid to stay at The Fitzwilliam I believe there is better value in Belfast City Centre.,3,2011,08,21
226,"Enormous rooms, great breakfast","I got a good deal on this hotel by booking early on the hotel's website (225 pounds for 3 nights, including breakfast).  The room was very comfortable and everything worked well.  The front desk people were very polite and helpful.  The hotel does everything they can to get you to go their bar and restaurant (which like most hotels, are way overpriced).  For instance, there are no sports channels available in the rooms--you have to go to the bar and buy a drink or two if you want to watch football.  Still, all in all this hotel was great.  Its close to all things of historical and cultural interest.  Furthermore, there are two mini grocery stores across the street (which is where I bought most of my food during my short stay in Belfast).  Its also in front of the famous Crown Liquor Saloon, a watering hole that dates from the mid-1800s!",5,2011,08,20
226,Excellent!,"Perfect for a night  away with friends. Well situated , close to all amenities. Friendly , efficient service. Rooms  were  cosy  with a retro feel. Only thing missing was some bottled water but we asked  for  a jug of iced water  from reception and it was no bother at all. Definately  return.",5,2011,08,20
226,Very Clean hotel with helpful staff,"This is a very nice hotel, checkin was very easy, staff were helpful and friendly, Room was spotless and very large , Shower hot and clean. All I would say is it is rather clinical and modern not particularly cosy .it is centrally located so easy to get around and not to far from Belfast City airport. We were on a deal that included breakfast and dinner. I was a little disapointed with the evening meal. Food was ok nothing special and menu is quite small. Breakfast was good though.",4,2011,08,18
226,A lovely stay with lovely staff- very happy!,"I don't normally leave reviews; however, we had such an amazing time when we stayed! The thing that stood out the most was the friendliness of the staff. The girls on reception are very polite, always smiling and are more than willing to help with all any requests that we had which creates a really personal touch. The concierge are very helpful with great tips about the city, the taxi tours etc... Overall a lovely stay with lovely staff- very happy!",5,2011,08,16
226,Great choice...no regrets!,"We had a wonderful stay in Belfast.  The Fitz was a great choice and we were exceptionally pleased.  Staff are extremely helpful and always pleasant and personable.  Continental Breakfast buffet was quite good and totally satisfying.  Hot Bar was okay, but not exciting.  We ate dinner frequently in the bar and were very satisfied with the quality of both food and service.  A little difficulty with temperature control, especially at night.  Overall, it was great and we will definitely consider returning to the Fitz!",5,2011,08,16
226,Gorgeous hotel,"Fabulous staff, fabulous rooms, fabulous food - fabulous stay!
Did i say that the Fitzwilliam was fabulous?  Seriously I loved it!",5,2011,08,16
226,Belfast's Best?,"Having spent a couple of nights in this hotel, I really can't fault it. Perfect sized rooms, with quality furnishings, excellent breakfast, and excellent lobby and bar. However, the most stand-out thing about this hotel was the friendliness of the staff who went out of their way to help, even a few days later when I needed their help. I've stayed in a few hotels in Belfast, and this one blows the others out of the water.",5,2011,08,15
226,Belfast. A great hotel option,"1 LOCATION: The hotel is very well located. It's right in the City centre. If you don't want to drive, take taxis, this is a good option. 2 BUILDING: Very nice ""modern"" building... 3 WELCOME: The staff is well trained. The welcome, service, etc...is very good! 4 ROOMS: Great decoration... very modern too! 5 BATHROOM: Same as for the room 6: DINNER: very good food.  7 OVERALL: This is a great hotel. I can't put 5 stars as I only keep it for the best hotels....",4,2011,08,15
226,"Great location, friendly staff, very clean","Located adjacent to the Opera house, a minute's walk from shopping and pubs, modern and clean. The friendly and professional concierge arranged a private mural tour for us and gave us advice on local pubs. The room was modern and spotlessly clean; An extra bed was provided for our child. We had a warm welcome, a great sleep and the best shower so it was perfect. We only stayed one night and did not dine in the hotel, but I suspect it would have been lovely.",5,2011,08,09
226,"Will def be back, loved every minute of it!!!!","The service from the staff in this hotel was above and beyond any expectations one might have, they could not have been any more helpful or attentive!  Our evening meal in the hotel was the nicest meal I would say any of us have ever had, and once again the service was excellent.  Lovely relaxing surroundings and a very clean well kept hotel.  There was a party of 16 of us and everyone rated the hotel extremely highly, especially as they were catering for group numbers!  I would also like to add that we felt we really got value for money.  Will def be back at the first chance I can!",5,2011,08,09
226,"Well, not really my expectations","First, after checking in we decided try the upstairs dining. I have to say I was totally dis-appointed. The room was adequate but the food was worse. It lacked any imagination and flavor. It was terribly bland and boring. I could have done better almost anywhere. The next morning we looked at the breakfast menu (maybe give it another try) but opted out and walked down the street a block to the Europa for an excellent breakfast.. I originally was going to book at the Europa but didn't. I wish I had.

However, the folks in the lobby and concierge where excellent. My hat off to them",2,2011,08,08
226,"Beautiful Hotel, great location","Myself and my husband stayed in Belfast for one night. The Fitzwilliam Hotel is a fantastic Hotel, our room was great with a huge bed and large bathroom, beautiful decor. We had a drink in the bar which is absolutely beautiful. The service was excellent and so friendly. The only thing to note is that it is very hard to find as there is no clear sign for the Fitzwilliam Hotel,  it only has the name over the door which is very hard to see as you drive by and you can easily pass it without realising however the valet parking makes up for this. Would definitely return and would definitely recommend it.",5,2011,08,08
226,Not really 5 star,"I think this hotel needs to work on a few things before it can call itself a 5 star hotel. On the positive side the check in was efficient and the girl was very friendly and helpful. The internet in the room was great. On the negative side - the toiletries in the room were poor, the type you get in really old fashioned hotels and scarce with that. I'm sure in the hotels blurb they mention free mineral water and robes/slippers none of which were in the room. The furniture is also looking a bit worn and ragged - think that eighties style black ash. The tv also only has 6 or 7 channels. The shower isn't exactly powerful and smelt very strongly of bleach when I went to use. We also had the joy of getting someone else's wake up call at 5.15 in the morning which was disorienteering to say the least!
Overall this hotel isn't bad but other hotels in Belfast like the Merchant or Malmaison do it much better.",3,2011,08,08
226,Very good hotel that aims to please,"When we got to our deluxe room I found it quite small and dark. I contacted the reception and they very kindly upgraded me. This really made our stay. The suite was beautiful with lovely views of the city and fabulous design. I particularly liked the massive freestanding bath and showers for two. 
        The food in the restaurant was excellent and the staff were flawless. I actually enjoyed the meal there more than Deanes the next night (although I enjoyed that too!!). The breakfast quality and service was also excellent. 
         For the price of our stay we recieved excellent value for money in a great city location.",4,2011,08,07
226,Don't listen to the negatives,"Loved every minute spent in this hotel. From the minute we pulled up we were met at the door by the fabulous concierge who then introduced us to the happiest reception team you will ever meet. The staff in this hotel obviously enjoy working there because they are all genuinely happy and this is almost contagious.

No hotel is perfect but the Fitzwilliam is as close as you will get",5,2011,08,06
226,Superb...!,"We're just back from a night in the ""Fitzwilliam"" and it was such a wonderful stay I had to write a review while it was fresh in my mind. My wife and I are regular visitors to Belfast and we usually stay in either the Hilton or the Radisson; never again. The ""Fitzwilliam"" is a major step up in term of service, decor, ambiance etc. and it  is much more central. 
 We booked a ""Summer in the city "" package which gave us an executive king room with breakfast and dinner for ¬£135. This was incredibly good value considering it is a 5 star hotel in the heart of Belfast. However what really made this an exceptional offer was the incredibly high standard of the food on offer for dinner.
 Generally hotel food leaves me cold and I am not a huge fan of fine dining but I can honestly say that it was one of the best meals I have ever had the pleasure of eating. The ""package"" menu was somewhat limited with 4 options for each of 3 courses but I needn't have worried as everything we ordered was delicious and full of flavours.The ""Brisket""and smoked mash was so devine I was tempted to stay a second night just to have it again! The white chocolate ice cream was heavenly as was my wife's Cappucino creme brulee.We were also fortunate to be served by Tina who was clearly passionate and extremly knowledgable about her job and whose recommendations for both the food and wine, helped to make it a truly memorable experience.One ""caveat"" however is that the offer of bread before your starter comes with a ¬£4charge which spoils an otherwise fantastic culinary experience.
 The breakfast is fine but a little ordinary compared to the dinner experience and would benefit from a wider variety of breads,scones,cheese,fruit etc. and I waited 25 minutes for housekeeping to bring me some towels so I could shower before dinner but they never showed up. A second call to reception and this was sorted but alas too late.
 This however was the only blip in an otherwise fantastic stay and we cant wait to return.",5,2011,08,05
226,Nice hotel good location,We stayed here for one night before touring Northern Ireland. The rooms were quite nice. Good Air conditioning. Great breakfast. The bar area was good. The hotel is located near the city center and city hall which is nice to visit. We would stay here again if we came to Belfast.,5,2011,08,04
226,Highly recommend!  Ticks all the boxes.,We had a single overnight stay on a Saturday night.  We were warmly welcomed and the hotel reception is lovely.  The hotel is situated in the centre of Belfast and ideal for reaching all city centre sights on foot.  It is next to the Grand Opera House.  The room was boutique style and fully equipped.  Breakfast held in the restaurant and included in the room price was excellent.  The hotel was fully booked and breakfast was busy but the buffet was clean and well stocked with a variety of hot and cold food.  I would highly recommend this hotel for a stay in central Belfast.,5,2011,08,04
226,"Amazing, we had the best time","My fianc√© and I stayed on Friday last as a surprise present from my parents on our recent engagement, and we had the most amazing room just beautiful, the staff were fantastic and really helpful it was just the best night and we will definitely be heading back as soon as we can, can‚Äôt recommend it highly enough.",5,2011,08,02
226,Nice contemporary hotel with a great restaurant,"The rooms and furnishings are very modern -- feels almost like a W Hotel.  We had some trouble with the air conditioning, and the staff worked very hard to resolve it as soon as it was brought to their attention.  We also thoroughly enjoyed our meals in the bar -- we had an appetizer one evening and a light dinner the next, and both were among the highlight meals of our trip.  This was very unexpected food from a hotel restaurant for sure!",4,2011,08,01
226,excellent attitude,"We arrived to celebrate my birthday only to discover that the room air conditioning did not appear to be working. I reported this to reception, a member of staff came to the room and agreed that there was a problem. We were offered an electric fan which we declined and asked instead for a change of room. After being informed that this was not possible and listening to apologies, I expressed my disappointment, particularly as this was a special occasion. As a compensatory gesture, we were given pre dinner drinks and a bottle of wine to accompany our meal which was part of our package. All the staff I spoke to were polite, friendly and very apologetic. What really impressed me was the fact that all staff members were informed of the arrangements  and I was wished happy birthday many times! Yes, it would have been great if a room change had been possible but the attitude of the staff at this hotel is why we shall definitely be returning. Good customer policy is rare these days and should therefore be rewarded. By the way, the meal was outstanding!",5,2011,08,01
226,Great boutique hotel in the centre of Belfast,"Originally chose this hotel purely due to cost, the Jury's Inn & Premier Inn were actually more expensive on reservation quotes!

Unbelievably blown away. The hotel is super clean; hotel staff are helpful & friendly; hotel should be listed in Mr & Mrs Smith as it is very contemporary & modern. 

The breakfast was superb, served in a great setting & a lot of variety to choose from. I highly recommend the porridge. 

Ask the concierge for a running map & he will show you a 5km or a 10km route that takes you through a gorgeous park as well as through Belfast central.

Hotel location is excellent, all the major sights are close by within walking distance.

Room was spacious & clean; bed was COMFY! 

I will definitely stay here again.",5,2011,08,01
226,Not 5 star,"Very disappointing; room was ok, but no little things I would expect from 5* hotel, like free mineral water, biscuits etc. Bathroom smelly and shower door broken.

Staff unfriendly and not very helpful. Service poor.",2,2011,08,01
226,Comfortable & friendly 4 star,"If I begin this review at the point of our arrival, unfortunately, I have to begin on a low note. This is a city-centre hotel and so we expect parking to be a problem. In fact we had taken the decision to pay ¬£17 for the valet parking so we could just turn up, empty the luggage and have the car taken away. When you arrive, you will find the hotel surrounded by no parking yellow lines. No problem, I thought, I will wait with the car whilst my wife goes to attract someone's attention. Surely they are used to moving cars quickly, especially when people have paid for the privilege. Unfortunately, it seems she had to fully check in first before someone would come out and move the car from the busy traffic (and potential parking ticket).

From that point forward things looked up. Staff were, in the main, friendly and helpful. The large room had a comfy sofa and was well maintained. The air-con worked well and I could dial the temp down to what we wanted. We found no faults whatsoever with the room.

We were only passing through Belfast and just wanted somewhere to take a break. We decided to eat in the bar (tasty food, usual hotel prices) and spent some time before and after in front of the mesmerising hole in the wall fire sitting on comfortable sofas  next to the lobby reading from some books we selected from the surprisingly good bookshelves (something for everyone, just help yourself).

We had a great night's sleep, which helps when you have another days travel to contend with. Breakfast was a little of a let down. The hotel blurb bigs up the breakfast experience and, let's face it, Ireland is known for its good breakfasts. This featured perhaps the smallest selection of cold varieties and cereals we had over the course of our two week holiday. The main course was served plated and, whilst of good quality, was also the smallest portion of our holiday ( perhaps not a bad thing by this stage, but for comparison purposes, smaller than everyone else's). Staff seemed to hide out of view and I noticed several people had to go looking for someone to bring them more coffee etc. Don't get me wrong, they were friendly and helpful, they just didn't make the connection between themselves and the customer unless prompted.

On balance, this sounds like a very negative review. However, I count our one night stay at the Fitzwilliam as one of the more comfortable and relaxing of our two weeks. Would I stay again? Yes. The staff are a credit to the hotel and took time out to chat and offer us advice on where to go, what to do and generally make us feel welcome. It was comfortable, the evening meal was good and the breakfast was passable (just have a word with the young staff). Only thing that really does need sorting is agreeing some kind of game plan with customers who have paid for valet parking - preferably sharing it with the customer before they arrive.",4,2011,07,31
226,Great Hotel,"Location is excellent, rooms clean and modern and the staff were lovely have recommended to friends and will definitely be back... And not too pricey :-) altho we went room only @ ¬£98 per night - break away from the babies so late mornings were a must!! The only down side is ¬£17 a day/night parking which could be expensive depending on the duration of the stay.",5,2011,07,30
226,Average 4 star,"Look it's fine.  A very modern hotel with a clear ambition to be at the upper end of the four star range.  Unfortunately they don't quite pull it off.  

Positives:  1. Great city centre location right next to the opera house and close enough to the buzzing cathedral quarter for the night life.  2.  Really good advice from reception on where to go for a drink and night on the town.  3.  The place is clean and everything works.  4.  If you're a fan of modern art deco style architecture and design you'll like the rooms and corridors.  The rooms are comfortable and well appointed and the king size bed was brilliant.

Negatives:  1.  Lost our last minute reservation (Double room, parking at a particular price) and then tried to change the room, price and price of the parking when we checked in.  Sorted quickly by the staff but a little irritating.  2.  I know it's a fancy hotel but everybody still accepts debit cards (instead of credit card) why not the Fitzwilliam?  What if I wanted to settle the bill in cash?  The staff really must be trained in how the payment options work  3.  The parking issue.  Parking at Belfast hotels seems to be an issue anyway and all the hotels seems to have some sort of strategy to boost their rates by fleecing guests for parking.  It's irritating and unhelpful.  As far as the Fitzwilliam is concerned; If you're going to have a ""valet service"" for which you expect to get paid and tipped for then get a Valet Person to meet you at the front door at a designated safe area, employ a Porter to take the luggage to the room and a Concierge to welcome you at the door and show you to reception.  This way you provide the service and charge a premium.  DON'T expect paying guests to pull up in the side street, leave the car there to go and look for the reception, then get the concierge to first take you luggage and then leave it unattended in the lobby while he drives your car 20 yards down the road to park it before he rushes back to get your luggage to the room‚Ä¶  And it was of course the wrong room.  You‚Äôll be a long time waiting for tip.   

For a four star hotel the Fitzwilliam is average.",3,2011,07,30
226,Fantastic service,We were very happy with the very pleasant & helpful young staff in this very central hotel . They made recommendations & bookings which really made our stay in Belfast so fantastic.Maybe could have had some extra pillows & face washers but I am sure if I had asked it wouldn't have been a problem.,5,2011,07,29
226,loved it will return,"bed breakfast and evening meal deal was excellent quality and value for money.  rooms are compact but beautifully presented , bathrooms are lovely. As a coffee addict really appreciated the tea and coffee making facilities.  Room was very comfortable, great temperature and totally quiet.   Staff are excellent, very helpful and friendly. Food is excellent quality.  Breakfast is great,  super variety .   Very relaxing restaurant, staff quietly efficient, will be back for a meal.
Would recommend this hotel for a stay or a meal to anyone, thoroughly enjoyed my first time there.  I have stayed in most  hotels in Belfast of similar rating or above and this compares very favourably.  Enjoy!",5,2011,07,29
226,Quirky but I love it,"I've stayed at the Fitz 5 times in the last 6 months and I always insist my Company books me in there when I'm working in Belfast.

It's like an over-sized boutique hotel and I love the quirky green and black decor in the rooms. The black and white tiled bathrooms always look great and the rooms have a regular bath as well as an huge, glass-walled shower.

The corridors have a purple theme and are almost disturbingly dark. But each room door has a full length mirror on the outside that seems to make up for the lighting.

The rooms aren't perfect. Some of the furnishings, such as the desk and bedside tables, are surprisingly cheap. I never seem to master the lighting controls but I love the hanging lights. The beds and bedding are luxurious.

What makes this hotel for me is the staff. They remember me from visit to visit and are genuinely friendly, helpful and professional. The top-hatted doormen offset the expensive parking - nothing is too much trouble to them.

Breakfast had improved on my recent trip. The new buffet approach provides the same good food in much less time. Full table service and menu is still available to those with time to kill. In the evenings the restaurant has a short but impressive menu and excellent service.

If, like me, you're the type of traveler that enjoys la difference and you don't sweat the small stuff then I highly recommend the Fitzwilliam.",4,2011,07,29
226,"large well appointed room, friendly staff","Stayed for business for 3 days, they had a free room and so allowed me to check in and use room from 0900. Large comfortable room. I spent all of day 2 on their excellent internet and used business centre for printing etc.  In the centre of town ""golden Mile "" with restuarants, Tesco experess  etc near by . Happy to recommend it",5,2011,07,29
226,"Good beds, curtains and breakfast","We stayed here for a weekend of relaxing  away and seeing a new city. Loved Belfast, and liked the Hotel a lot. Is very stylish. Beds were really comfortable, and the curtains lovely and dark so we could have a nice lie in. Breakfast was also really delicious. The staff were all friendly, but for the price and star rating one expects a little bit more. (For example the rooms were far too hot and our plug was broken in the bathroom; they tried to mend the plug but were unable to and they tried to explain to us that we could control the room temperature but we couldn't alter it at all. But saying that I would recommend the hotel.",4,2011,07,28
226,"Really fab hotel, really hot rooms though..","We have a brilliant time at this hotel, the bedroom was large and the d√©cor was beautiful.  when we returned to our room in the evening the heat was unreal, so uncomfortable. We called reception who said the air con had broken that day which we understood as these things happen.  As it was so uncomfortable we found it very difficult to sleep and were up at 6.30am giving up our fight for sleep!  Breakfast was beautiful, without a fault. Check out was smooth and we mentioned the air con, which the receptionist informed us had broken last week! This was disappointing, such a lovely hotel ticking all the other boxes should get the air con fixed asap as the windows do not open in the rooms.",4,2011,07,28
226,Disappointed to be disappointed :(,"I had driven past the Fitzwilliam in awe on a fair few occasions. It just hit me as one of those properties I longed to try out for a city break. A trendy hotel, a boutique hotel, a new hotel.. a five star hotel.. RIGHT up my alley!! 

Well, I got my way and recently had a bed & breakfast stay at the Fitzwilliam. I  am disappointed to report I found about three stars during our stay but struggled to find the other two.. and I mean really struggled. I can see what they're aiming for here, a luxury hotel with a twist. Somewhere along the way however a couple of things went astray.

The welcome - No complaints here, The gentleman who checked us in was professional, informative and personable. We were informed of opening times, what was where, offered a wake up call, etc. First impressions were good.

The Room - Hmm, what can I say? I honestly felt I was staying in a Holiday Inn with a fancy bathroom. There is nothing in the room that just made you say.. ""ahh, now that's five star"". The furniture is beginning to wear and it lacked those comforts that one would expect in a basic four star property. There was no bottled water, a primitive channel selection on the TV, no robes, no slippers. Towels were on the skimpy side and for the life of me I couldn't find a facecloth!! Fixtures and fittings in the bathroom were loose and the ""powerful sunflower shower"" described on the website was more like a drizzle. I had a bath during my stay which must be fitted with a flow rate filter as it took an age to fill. Don't expect to fill your bags with the complementary toiletries, these too were few and far between. One small body wash and shampoo was all that was on offer. We ate breakfast in the restaurant but breakfast cards was provided, the room itself dose not offer superb dining facilities, I would be in favour of removing the redundant couch in the room to make way for a small table and chairs.

Public Areas - Probably the best thing about the Fitzwilliam is the lobby, clean, funky and fresh. Candles were lit in the evening time and set the mood nicely. We didn't have dinner, just a couple of cocktails in the bar which were prepared quickly and professionally. We didn't find the bar staff here overly friendly or chatty. A common theme running through the Bar & Restaurant we're these booths.. I wanted to like them, but it has to be noted that they are more suited to a city diner that a five star hotel. 

Breakfast - Again it was only just ok. There seemed to be an army of staff on hand but yet the toasting was left up to the guest (???)   Food was hot but selection was poor, juices were at a minimum and fresh fruit was at a minimum.

The verdict - A cloud of guilt is hanging over me as I'm typing my review but it has to be said. Do not go to the Fitzwilliam expecting a five star experience. It just isn't there. Nothing, and I mean nothing about this property warrants the five star certification. That's not to say it can't be put right. With a bit of hard graft this could be a great hotel in a great central location. I enjoyed my stay here, but I have good company to thank for that.",3,2011,07,27
226,fantastiv hotel,"beautiful hotel, very comfortable room, excellent staff, perfect location. 
I will definately return.",5,2011,07,26
226,Perfect mini honeymoon,"Loved every minute, the staff are very attentive, always wanting to please and make sure you are taken care of.  They do stretch the meals and sometimes you are left waiting so if you are in a rush I wouldn't advise the dinner but if you want to savour each others company then is perfect. 
The room was extremely comfortable and spacious, the bed was amazing. The bathroom was large and well decorated.  ",4,2011,07,24
226,A comfortable and smart looking hotel.,"A very smart modern hotel in central Belfast. Room was bigger than expected and bathroom was fine and very well laid out. I liked the dimmed lighting in the hallways. Friendly staff at reception, bar and restaurant. Bar food was actually very good. Breakfast is overpriced but that's hotels for you. Hotel is excellently located.  I would happily stay here again and probably will.",4,2011,07,24
226,accessable luxury,"my daughter and I stayed in The Fitzwilliam Hotel for one night prior to her graduation, the hotel staff were very helpful and most pleasant. Our room was spotlessly clean however the shower door did not close properly. At night the room became very hot but this is not too much of a complaint as the air conditioning was in excellent working order.
The hotel was very quite and peaceful, hard to imagine we were in the centre of Belfast mid-week.
I would recommend The Fitzwilliam, it's city centre position is such a bonus.",4,2011,07,20
226,"Very smart, modern and impressive hotel in central Belfast... but why provide a bath without salts/creme/bubble bath!?","This hotel is a beautiful place to stay in Belfast although there are a few little things which annoy. They are the sort of items which puzzle at a 5-star hotel. You have to pay ¬£1.50 for a razor kit, there isn't a complimentary paper and there is a limited supply of toiletries. If this was changed it would make a massive difference. 
The hotel itself is fantastic. It is centrally located and offers a real blend of modern and classic in its approach to style and service. 
The rooms are have a feeling of luch about them. There is a CD player in the room, good size flat screen with movies and the beds are simply amazing!
The bathrooms are very clean, luxury and large. Room service and mini-bar in the hotel are exceptionally expensive (¬£3.50 for a small can of cola, ¬£10.00 cover charge on room service on already expensive food).
The door service and reception service is very good. Staff are friendly and very informative. The whole hotel is a pleasure to visit and feels like real quality. I loved the breakfast, too! Check out is 12 noon but for ¬£10 they let you stay until 2pm which is a treat if you are on a later flight.
Location wise, you could not find better. Central to everything. Opera house next door, Crowne pub opposite and everything close by.",5,2011,07,19
226,Fabulous Hotel in great location!!!,"From the moment my friend and I walked through the door, we received a very warm welcome from both reception staff and porters. The room itself has modern decor, very nice and spotlessly clean. The bar has  anice ambience about it. Again bar staff friendly and i would definitley make the hotal my first choice when booking for Belfast again.",5,2011,07,18
226,trying a little to hard to be trendy,"very pleasant overall - good quiet rooms, breakfast fine, staff friendly, dinner uninspiring. Seemed almost empty when we were the - maybe staying on the 12th july was relevant to that.
Pity they didn't think to light the corridors and the the dark colour scheme  in the bedroom was gloomy. The seats in the dining room looked trendy but not that great to sit in.",4,2011,07,17
226,Already planning my next trip,"Absolutley lovely hotel.  The staff went above and beyond in every sort of way.  The front desk reception was warm and kind. Very expedient and freindly.  The concierge service was second to none.  They were promt when a request was made, and the recommedations were fantastic!!!!  I would recommend anyone to stay here to have a feel of being at home!",5,2011,07,16
226,"nice hotel, not so nice employees","the hotel was nice. the first night the food was bad but the second night, the steak was good. the drinks were good but the bartenders..not so much. but i have noticed that there are not many nice people in northern ireland so its not there fault. if i ever decide to go to northern ireland(which i prob wont) i would stay here again. 
its in a good location. with the crown across the street.",3,2011,07,14
226,A REAL TREAT,What a delightful weekend we had. The staff couldn't do enough for us and when we passed by reception the young blonde receptionist even remembered us and addressed us as Mr and Mrs Sharpe. The food in the restaurant was delicious and the relaxed ambience of the Fitzwilliam was so nice. We will be back!,5,2011,07,12
226,"""Friendly staff an asset and made us want to come back""","This hotel is in an excellent central location and our room was excellent with a bed that ensured good night's sleep.
The staff have excellent local knowledge and are more than willing to help, try the black cab tour which Chris (our concierge) organized and proved excellent and memorable.
Reception staff were warm and friendly and a credit to the hotel.
Check out the Crown pub across the road from the hotel,steeped in history and well worth a visit.
Do not miss the Giants causeway tour which picks up next to the hotel.",5,2011,07,12
226,Celebrity Service,"I cannot praise the Fitzwilliam highly enough. The staff were incredibly helpful, it felt like we were celebrities. From the moment we arrived Christopher, the porter, took our bag whilst we checked in. He then took our bag up to our room and showed us around the room. Gerard, another porter, was very helpful in advising what to do on our day in Belfast.

The breakfast food was excellent, it was incredibly fresh. If we had had the chance we would definitely have eaten at the restaurant.

Would highly recommend a stay at The Fitzwilliam.",5,2011,07,08
226,Great place for wedding parties to stay,We recommended the Fitzwilliam to our wedding guests who were travelling from afar.  They were able to offer us rooms at a very reasonable price and everyone was very impressed with the quality of the hotel.  The service was brilliant  and we would definitely stay here again too.,5,2011,07,07
226,Just about 4 star...NOT 5 star!!,"Booked 1 night for our anniversary in a suite with breakfast and dinner.

Reception area nice possibly best feature of hotel.
Reception staff very friendly and welcoming too. Conceirge very friendly and helpful also.

First impressions on stepping out of the lift to our floor (where room was) was the severe lack of light and fresh air...what are they doing here????? Room was good size ..bathroom and sinks lovely feature and large bed was very comfortable. Furniture was showing obvious signs of wear and tear..this was a little too obvious! shower heads were loose on the shower wall...minibar had not been stocked and rug on floor could have done with better cleaning. TV selection was 3 star...pushing at it! - 7 channels!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! for 5 star????? Movies, internet and music available through TV at extra cost...bit of a lame money making tactic...crap tv and promotion of products to buy! Hi-fi system nice extra...bathrobes were very worn looking. Air-conditioning in room was very noisy and this was difficult in the middle of the night as it disturbed our sleep...no windows that open in the room...bad mistake there...no fresh air! However windows did provide an excellent view of belfast.

Restaurant furniture and layout was not great...we were seated in a booth ...more typical of a fast-food restaurant. I did enjoy my meal and I could not fault the staff here.
Breakfast was minimal. Only 1 bowl of mixed fruit and 1 very small platter of cold meat (2 choices here). Had to stand at toaster machine ...5 star service not!, cooked breakfast was a disgrace for a 5 star hotel poor selection and poorly presented. Insufficent condiments / butter / sauces. No chesse and very small selection of yoghurts. I have stayed in many hotels and this breakfast would pale in comparison to the many 3 and 4 star hotels I have stayed. 
The bar was very good and the staff here were excellent. Car park good and we were allowed to leave it there the next day (our departure) until middle of the day at no extra cost. Location of hotel excellent as well.

I think that if you book 5 star you expect 5 star quality and when the hotel doesn't live up to this customers will be diappointed with their overall experience. I wonder who rated this hotel as 5 star as it is very clearly not. The concierge are the only aspect of this hotel that live up to the 5 star experience...I think the manager needs to wave the magic wand and tidy things up  !!!!!!",3,2011,07,04
226,"Excellent lodging: stylish rooms, very amiable and solicitous staff and bargain rates. Highly recommended..","No real suggestions, except why do non-US hotels never provide washcloths?!

More importantly, every member of the staff we dealt with was extremely courteous, amiable and very solicitous without being intrusive. We would highly recommend the FitzWilliam to others and would stay there again.",5,2011,07,04
226,Posh Overnight,"My first time in this relatively new hotel was a pleasant surprise. Its location is perfect. right bang in the middle of the action for shopping, bars and clubs etc.
A good lobby with comfortable seating in front of that unusual as fire, with very modern decor and views out onto the busy Gt Victoria Street. 
A dark but cosy modern bar, tucked in out of sight of the other public areas, where you can drink as long as you want ... if you want.
But the highlights are the bed rooms, or even the beds (which are the most comfortable i've ever slept in). A non standard hotel room layout makes for a fresh feeling.
And the staff are very courteous and efficient. Definitely my choice for my next stay in Belfast",5,2011,07,04
226,Ran out of food at breakfast time !!!,"The Fitzwilliam is pretending to be something it isn't. The rooms are garish, not classy. The furniture looks flash but is uncomfortable and not functional. The service was a wash-out. Until a hotel gets the element of ""customer service"" correct, all the flash in the world doesn't make it comfortable. The buffet breakfast was a joke, all the food disappeared within minutes of being put out and a lot of us waited over 20 minutes for something else to arrive. Doesn't get my vote and I won't be back.",2,2011,07,04
226,Excellent hotel,Stayed recently on second visit. Revamped self service breakfast not great.,4,2011,07,03
226,Fantastic Hotel - excellent service - shame about the breakfasts,"Stayed in the Fitzwilliam for 3 nights when we were in Belfast for a family wedding.   Loved the hotel - really modern, and the service was absolutely excellent - the staff could not have done enough for us.  Disappointing breakfasts - each morning there was food which had run out in particular bacon - we seemed to have to wait for it to appear - not what you would expect from any hotel far less a 5* particularly for the price paid.   Having said that we would still stay in the hotel if visiting Belfast again but possibly on a room only basis.  Parking ¬£17 per night - enclosed area but a bit expensive.",5,2011,06,29
226,Good Hotel!,"Very nice rooms, very clean, convenient location in the centre of the city, friendly staff. The breakfast menu is good but not very good. There is no spa, swimming pool or sauna, one would expect in this hotel category. Parking is available but costs  17 GBP extra per night, what I felt to be a bit expensive. Don't forget to have a swipe of your credit card at the reception before checking in. Otherwise the minibar remains looked!",4,2011,06,28
226,"Modern Hotel, great location","The Fitzwilliam is very centrally located in the heart of Belfast.  The staff were helpful with directions and attractions.  It is a large modern hotel with many amenities.  Our room was clean and the bathroom was large and had both a shower and a tub which was nice for relaxing at night.
WiFi  was available in the lobby.
Not for people that want historical hotels.",4,2011,06,26
226,Nice and new.,"We stayed for 4 nights. It was a convenient location - relatively close to the shops but also easy to navigate to from the motorway.

The service at our first breakfast was a bit hit and miss, but improved every day. On the last day, everyone was so friendly that we were sad to leave. 

We weren't impressed when a junior concierge told us that there was no laundromat in the city. We found ""Quality Speedy Cleaners"" just two blocks away on Queen St to be excellent. A good and inexpensive laundry service is important when traveling on holidays with a baby. 

The food was great and the rooms were nice and we got great friendly service from the concierge 'Phillip'.
",4,2011,06,23
226,Lovely city centre hotel,"We stayed here for 2 nights - a Saturday and Sunday - and paid a total of ¬£195 via Laterooms for room only. The hotel is well placed for all Belfast has to offer and is right by the bus station where the airport bus terminates. Our room (305) was comfortable and quiet. There was a little road noise on the Monday morning reflecting its location in the business part of Belfast, apart from that the only other thing I heard all weekend was a man singing in the street at 1am when Rory McIlroy won the golf!
We didn't take any meals in the hotel although the restaurant looked very nice. The veggie breakfast was ¬£13 but as there were so many pubs and cafes nearby we decided to venture out. We asked the concierge about a city tour by taxi and he recommened one and organised it for us - it was the highlight of our weekend.",5,2011,06,23
226,Unbeatable Service,"From the moment we pulled up to the hotel to the point the valet returned my car keys, the service was impeccable.  

They manage to pull off friendly and helpful in a convincing manner.  It was really refreshing after the more usual stiffness or indifference one experiences these days.

The hotel itself is clean, comfortable,  modern, close to night life and restaurants.  Loved the room.

Overall, the hotel made the trip special.  Would certainly go back.",5,2011,06,20
226,Great place to stay,"Really nice hotel overall. Great decor, very comfortable environment without being overbearing.
Rooms are nicely decorated, but could do with being a bit bigger (I had a basic room so I guess the premium rooms are probably more spatious).
Bed very comfortable and I slept well.
Breakfast good, but definitely recommend eating dinner in the restaurant. The fish I had was perfectly cooked - probably the best I have ever had. Also the pre-theatre menu is great value - but you have to eat before 6.30pm to get good prices.
Only thing that would have made it even better for me would have been decent gym facility. There is a 'gym room' but its small and has minimal equipment. However if you are here for a short stay - its probably good enough.",4,2011,06,19
226,"Highly recommend, loved it","Lovely modern stylish hotel, great location, staff are extremely helpful & friendly, service & food great. Belfast is a brilliant place to visit, will certainly go back.",5,2011,06,17
226,Modern Irish charm,"We were warmly welcomed and our bags delivered to our rooms when we arrived.  The lobby area is very modern and stylish decor with with a lovely fire.  It was quite beautiful.

The rooms looked exactly like the pictures on their website with a rain-type shower and seperate bathtub for relaxing.  Everyone that worked at the hotel was more than friendly and accomadating and seemed to really enjoy working at the hotel.  

Nice little extra: room came with turn down service

Valet was ¬£17

Breakfast: immediate and friendly service with a delicious Irish breakfast (your choice of eggs) worth buying the room/breakfast combo.

The location is perfectly placed between the Cathedral and the Ulster Museum for site seers and only about a 10-15 min walk to the Duke of York and just around the corner from The Crown liquor Saloon and City Hall.

We had a wonderful stay and would definitely recommend it.",5,2011,06,16
226,Great service but a couple of problems,"Stayed in the Fitzwilliam recently for our wedding anniversary.  Lovely hotel, great staff (especially the concierge staff) but were unimpressed at having to pay ¬£17 per night for carparking.  Ate in the bar which was fine but has a very limited menu and wine is very expensive.  We had hoped to eat in the restaurant which according to our room menu was open until 10:00pm.  We arrived at 9:35pm to be told that the kitchen was closed and we would be unable to have a meal.  As we were residents of the hotel I thought this was pretty poor.  We opted instead for room service but were told that hot food was not available after 10:00pm! 
A lovely hotel. clean and well presented, good service but in my opinion needs to sort out the dining arrangements.",4,2011,06,15
226,A great hotel in a great location with great service!,"Booked The Fitzwilliam after many stays in other Belfast Hotels where I had always found the service and rooms very good. I had read some of the bad reviews on here about the Fitzwilliam and was a little nervous as we checked in, however I can safely say that this is the best hotel in Belfast, we had no issues at all. The only thing we found was a great hotel with fantastic service, a proper 5 star hotel! If you stay here you will not be disappointed, we will be back!",5,2011,06,14
226,Great hotel in centre of Belfast!,"Arriving after a long drive from Letterkenny,via Giants Causeway we were delighted to find that we had been upgraded to a suite.The concierge was very helpful organising a black cab tour for us the following day even though it was after 6pm.The room was lovely and very modern,loved the bathroom!!We decided to take advantage of the room,ordering in room service.The food was fantastic,service prompt and staff friendly.Next morning our cab arrived as promised,and even though it was supposed to be a 12pm checkout,the hotel allowed us to stay till 1.30pm no extra charge as the cab tour went over time.Would deinately recommend this hotel",4,2011,06,13
226,Good Hotel - very enjoyable!,"We stayed just 1 night - myself and my teenage girls.  Check in was easy - and staff very nice.  We booked a studio room - and it was lovely.  Nice King sized bed and they had a full single bed set up in the room.  Nice sofa, wonderful 2 head shower - a real treat - we all loved the shower!  We went and had lunch in the bar - which was well presented and very nice.  The hotel is modern - with dark corridors and modern furniture, and bright well lit rooms.  
Only thing that spoiled our experience was the air conditioning.  You cannot open the windows and the room gets very warm - you have to turn on the air conditioning - and it is far too noisy.  You cannot sleep well - as it kicks in even on low fan - it is very noisy! If i was staying there for work - and having to stay a few nights - this would not work.

Breakfast was good - better than many hotels that I have stayed in recently - all cooked food was made to order! 

All in all - we had a blast - with very good rates.  Got to be one of the best in Belfast!",4,2011,06,13
226,"Great Hotel, very Funky, Fab Service, great location, will be back","Stayed in the Fitzwilliam last week for 5 nights whilst in Belfast on Business, and the Hotel is in a great, very central location.  The staff are fantastic, there when you need then, out of sight the rest of the time.  Breakfast was great, fan buffet, fresh fruit salad, great fresh breads, great cooked breakfasts, and while not cheap, it was so as stupidly overpriced as is often the case in Hotels.
My room, their entry level basic room, was anything but, HUGE, big bed, sofa, flat screen TV, funky lamps, enough lighting, great desk workspace area with enough plugs for laptop + various charges.  The coffee making facilities even included a small caffetiere and fresh ground coffee beans - what more could anyone ask for? 
Lovely towels, excellent toiletries - restocked every day.
Only niggle was that I found it much cheaper on lastminute.com than anything the hotel itself could offer, so shop around for prices.
Summing up: Excellent and I will be back next time I'm in Belfast.",5,2011,06,13
226,loved it and will be back,"from the moment we arrived we felt right at home,had to be the warm smile from the girl at reception who greeted us,would recommend you pay that little bit extra to stay here,oh and try the cocktails",5,2011,06,13
226,Great Hotel!,"We stayed here for a weekend away just myself and my partner, i had recently found out i was pregnant and we had already booked our flights and hotel so decided to go ahead with the trip anyway.
I was suffering teribly with 'morning sickness' so spent most of our time in the hotel room which was a shame but i cant complain about a simple thing! The room was spacious and spotless with a contemporary feel and the bed was huge and really comfortable. As for food, we ordered room service on the first night which arrived quickly and was of great quality and on the second night we ate at the restaurant which was equally as tasty, the criossants at breakfast were easily the best i have eaten- highly recommended! my partner had the cooked breakfast which he enjoyed but im afraid i couldnt manage one and i must admit i was jelous as it looked amazing!!

Great location, great hotel, great food, fantastic service- highly recommended!!",5,2011,06,13
226,Only 1 small comment,We stayed for a night with our 1 year old and loved the hotel. Everyone was very helpful and there was a can do attitude which i liked. The only one small issue and it really is small was at dinner as we sat down (before we were given the menus) we were asked if we would like olives and bread. I said yes immediately. Its Ireland doesn‚Äôt bread come with everything as par for the course! When the menus arrived I saw that olives and bread were ‚Ç¨4 and ‚Ç¨3 each. I felt a bit annoyed as I had (maybe stupidly) thought this was a nice touch. Other than that all 3 of us loved it and would stay again. (Our 1 year old slept for 12 hours in the hotel cot which is a great endorsement!!!),5,2011,06,09
226,Excellent getaway!,"Stayed last night in the Fitzwilliam Hotel, Belfast.  Excellent experience all round from check in to leaving.  We had an executive room on the 6th floor, which was well furnished, nice comfortable bed, sofa, desk and lots of nice mood lighting.  The bathroom was lovely, very modern with bath and seperate double shower cubicle with rainfall shower, lovely after a night on the town! Rooms are very clean and have great airconditioning. We ate dinner in the Bar, which was lovely - not massive portions but you are getting quality, not quantity.!We were served by Sean, who was very pleasant and friendly.  Breakfast was very substantial, with a good selection of continental choices followed by a full cooked breakfast and lovely coffee!  The staff were well organised and helpful and all very pleasant, especially Tina.  Enjoyed our stay and will be booking another stay very soon.  A perfect base to explore the city.",5,2011,06,05
226,quite good,"Nice hotel, fresh clean rooms. Breakfast is above average. Rooms have trendy decor which is a bit annoying. A pointless stereo system with no attachment to play from mp3 player was also quite annoying.",4,2011,06,04
226,Cant wait to go back!,We stayed here on a romantic night away and it definetly didnt disappoint. Staff were more than helpful & friendly. Rooms were modern trendy & very spacious with fab bright colours. Breakfast was superb. Wud def recommend this hotel.,4,2011,06,04
226,Not worth the money,"Very dissapointing.  Uncleaned room, air con not working, key didn't work for own room, wi fi not working.  Not what you expect at that price.  Staff very nice to be fair and location is good.  I'm told it used to be really good, but it has gone donehill badly.  What a waste of money.",1,2011,06,04
226,Great hotel,"Stayed 4 nights in may, decided to give the Europa a miss (where we normally stay) what a good idea it was ... beats the Europa hands down

Lovely bedrooms, spacious and clean and friendly staffand concierge

Would DEFF stay again",5,2011,05,31
226,Top-notch Belfast hotel,"Stayed for three nights in May 2011. From the minute we walked through the door we knew this place was special. Concierge staff were always cheerful and could not do enough to help, especially James! Room was spacious, bed comfy, decor v. modern, and although we were facing the road we heard no noise whatsoever. Very good value if you get a promotional rate. The only negative was breakfast - quite pricey for what you get -go down the road to Maggie May's for a proper ulster fry at a fraction of the price!",5,2011,05,31
226,This is a must!,"Excellent friendly and helpful staff, beautiful room very clean and modern, excellent value, great location, gorgeous food",5,2011,05,30
226,how they can call themselves a 5*?????????,"I have stayed in a number of hotels in Belfast but this time we really wanted to have a little bit of luxury.  Well never again from the minute we checked in there was problems.  We were charged an incorrect rate which was actually ¬£100 more than our orginal price, when i questioned this the reply from the unpleasant receptionist was ""Awh rite ok"" no opology or anything i was also quite embarrassed as there was quite a few people at reception also checking in.  Room quite nice but decor really dark and not enough bathroom space also the heat was soo uncomforable that it was really difficult to enjoy staying in it.  On checkout the same receptionist tried to charge us for 2 nights car parking which we did not have and once again the same unpleasant response.  When i checked my account a few days later there was a transaction from my account from the hotel which i didnt know what was for. I contacted the hotel and was told that it was for carparking which i AGAIN told them we didnt use i was told i would have a call back in a few minutes after they checked this out.  Never rec'd a call back had to phone them myself the next day when agaiin i was told the same story.  FInally got it sorted out but when they refunded my account it was ¬£1 less than what they took not the amount but the principle.  So all in all i will never stay in this hotel again as i think the actions and attitude of this hotel are not 5* my bit of advice would to book into the Europa which is just beside it and totally lives up to its reputation.",1,2011,05,30
226,Disaster,"Booked this Hotel,they sent me the confirmation paperwork and everything was set for a great weekend in Belfast City centre.Looking forward to experience life in the City,visit the famous bars and nightclubs,also the continental market was one of the main attractions for us.Then disaster struck as soon as we arrived.When we went to book in they gave us some silly excuse that they had maintnence problems with the room and we would have to go to the Culloden hotel,which is around 6 miles from the City.We were later told in confidence that they had overbooked which is normal for them to do so.Then you cannot have a refund so you have to stay where they put you.It's a nasty tactic they have adopted,seems they are desperate for custom.NEVER AGAIN.",1,2011,05,29
226,Loved this hotel!!!,"Brilliant hotel, situated close to airport transport, day tours, and shopping.",5,2011,05,28
226,Great hotel in Belfast,"Stayed for 3 nights  B&B booked through the hotel website. We stayed in an executive room, which I think is the lowest level room they have, and were very impressed. The room had a huge comfortable bed,flat screen TV,  music player.free safe, iron and board. If you bring your own laptop or similar divice Wifi is free. If I am being picky the sockets were hard to reach as they were behind the desk, but that is my only critisism.The bathroom was clean,and modern with a great shower. Breakfast was of an exceptionally high standard.Recommend the Eggs Benedict. The continental section was also of a very high standard.All staff we spoke to were friendly and efficient. We had asked for a quiet room and were given one on the Opera House side of the hotel which was great no noise at all.The hotel is in a good location within walkin distance of the city centre. 
We had booked tickets to see ""Spamalot"" at the Opera House Theatre next door to the hotel, which was hilarious and one of the most beauitiful theatres I have seen. We had a few drinks at the Crowne Bar nearby which is the oldest bar in belfast and owned by the national trust. It is worth seeing, like going back in time 100 years.
We ate at ""Cayenne"" and ""Mourne Seafood"" both were good and will review these seperately.
On Saturday morning we went to St George market. What a choice of food stuffs. If you go then go hungry as the food on offer looked delicious but we had eaten a huge breakfast and did not manage to try much. The home baking in perticular looked amazing.
After the market we went for some retail therapy at the Victoria Shopping Centre. Great selection of shops, some very upmarket.There are the usual chain restaurants for food or a cocktail or too. There is also a cinema.We took the lift to the top floor into the glass dome where there is a viewing gallery. Really worth doing, need a head for heights which I don't have, but still enjoyed. 
On the Sunday we had booked a bus trip with ""Allens Tours"" to visit the Giants Causway, Carrick Rope Bridge and Bushmills. Had a gread day out and these are all really worth seeing. You will need sensible footwear though as the rope bridge is a 15/20 minute walk from the carpark and a bit of a climb on the way back.At the causway you can pay ¬£1 each way and catch the little bus from the carpark that will take you right to the causeway. If you walked, again I would say 15/20 minutes and uphill on way back. We were dissaspointed to learn that we would not be able to tour Bushmills and were only stopping at the gift shop. The  scottish coach driver was very knowlegable and we learned a lot on the way. Think I would try another tour company on returning.
We had a great weekend and if you are reading this and thinking of visiting Belfast then do. The people are lovely,they are quiet, reserved and gentle , not what I was expecting at all. We will return and will most likely stay at The Fitzwilliam.",5,2011,05,25
226,Second stay at this great spot,"Really enjoyed both stays here - once to go to the Opera House with my mother, who also stayed, and once for a general night out in Belfast. Rooms are lovely- quite spacious with sofa, and beds very comfy,   Bathrooms are class with black/white mosiac tiles and good showers, one room also had bath.
Great location for pubs and restaurants - Crown Bar, Europa, Dean's, Fibber Magee's all steps away with the range of others in Cathedral Quarter not too far away. Great for shops too. 
Breakfast was good, and we also had the pre theatre supper which was excellent quality and superb value. We also enjoyed a bar meal during our first stay.
The lobby area is quite small so you miss a bit of that atmosphere in some hotels where you can sit in lobby and enjoy ambience/people watch. Bar and restaurant are internal rooms with no external aspect.
Parking is expensive through hotel and even drop off can be a little difficult as there is very limited space to stop and unload.
Sfaff are helpful and friendly - all in all a good place to stay.",5,2011,05,24
226,"Fitzwilliam ""fit for a king""","This is the second time I have stayed in the fitzwilliam, having being very impressed on my first occasion- the second certainly did not let my expectations down!

The fitzwilliam is in the perfect location- right in the city centre. Despite this, it has a elegant tranquility and a feeling of peaceful escape and you certainly would not realise you were in the centre of northern irelands capital once inside its doors.

The staff are mannerly, polite and always willing to help and very well presented.  

The hotel itself is impeccable, the rooms are immaculate, the bar was very atmospheric and the concierge was bustling!

My only slight quibble is the expense of the carpark- ¬£17 for one night given the price of the rooms is a bit much to ask.

Overall, definitely the best hotel in Belfast in my humble opinion!",5,2011,05,24
226,"Fabulous hotel with a fantastic, extremely friendly staff","I stayed at the Fitzwilliam on my first visit to Belfast for 3 nights.  From making the booking to check out everything was handled very efficiently and in a very friendly manner.  The hotel staff looked after all my needs and even booked an amazing private political / historical 2 hour tour of Belfast for me, which was brilliant (Billy was amazing).

Thanks very much, I always want to stay at the Fitzwilliam when I come to Belfast.",5,2011,05,23
226,"Amazing hotel, very friendly and helpful staff, superb food by Chef Kevin Thornton.","Going by the photographs of the hotel on the web it looked great and they are a true reflection of the hotel. It‚Äôs situated next to the Grand Opera House and close walking distance the city centre for shopping, pubs, restaurants, not that you would miss the opportunity to dine at the hotel restaurant. For those of you that know the G hotel in Co Galway it like it but better and excellent value, enjoy you stay.",5,2011,05,21
226,Great Location and Value,"Stayed at the Fitzwilliam recently and it is a great base to explore the city from as everything is within walking distance.

We got a very good rate because we went mid week and we found the staff to be very pleasant and helpful. The hotel itself is clean and modern although there are better dining options to be had outside of the hotel. Car parking is expensive so if you can do without a car then don't bring it.

I will definitely stay here on my next visit to Betfast.",4,2011,05,17
226,Well polished!,"This is a new hotel in Belfast, right next door to the opera house, it's a well finished hotel right in the centre of the city. Rooms are cosy and look the part, the bar/restaurant is also very classy, great spot :)",5,2011,05,15
226,"Very nice, great value, great grub and buzzing atmosphere","Got dinner Bed breakfast deal for ¬£150...Beautiful decor, great food in restaurant, great wine selection....yummy malbec...bar v nice but alot of big hen parties...they weren't rowdy but a little overpowering. Cocktails a bit pricey for uk standards. Nice shampoo etc in room. Would stay again if we cone back to Belfast (not v impressed with the city so probably not)",5,2011,05,15
226,Good value in a central location,"We were pleasantly surprised by the compactness of Belfast and the Fitzwilliam is very well placed to provide very easy access to all the main attractions.  Everywhere except Stormont Castle is within a maximum of 10 - 15 minutes on foot.  The Opera House adjoins the hotel so it is a perfect base if you are going to a show.

We found the hotel to be first class.  It is relatively new and all the public areas are attractive and very well maintained.  The room and bathroom were very well appointed and spotless.  If the Fitzwilliam is a five star hotel, the room was smaller than might have been anticipated.  Our room also looked out to a blank, brick wall.  But you don't visit a city to spend too long in your room.

The hotel has a Michelin starred restaurant which we didn't use as the menu wasn't really to our (simple?) taste - so can't comment.  However the breakfasts were absolutely great.

All the staff we encountered were unfailingly helpful and polite.  The concierge even insisted we take a hotel umbrella in case it rained!  In Belfast, surely not!  Thanks to all of them.  

We booked the Fitzwilliam as a result of Tripadvisor reviews and we were not disappointed.  If returning to Belfast we would certainly stay there again.",5,2011,05,12
226,Excellent modern hotel,"Very stylish modern hotel with fantastic staff, a great bar, and an excellent concierge. Our room was very comfortable and spacious as well as tastefully done out. The only criticism was that for the two of us staying in the room there was only one tiny bottle of complimentary water. Given the quality of the cocktails downstairs, having a big bottle of water in the room would've been helpful. But that's a tiny criticism in the context of an excellent all round experience.",5,2011,05,10
226,"Chic, Boutique hotel with extremely friendly staff. Well worth paying a visit too!!","We have just recently stayed in the fitzwilliam hotel for my sisters hen night, there were 26 of us and I have to say we had a fantastic time,  the hotel staff were absolutely fantastic, very friendly, extremely helpful  (especially Grainne in reception).  The hotel itself was beautiful, with its contemporary interiors, candles in the bedroom and a personalised welcome note complete with choc's for the bride to be.!! -  It was these little personal touches that made our experience a more memorable one. The grand opera house is literally a hop, skip and jump a way!!!, not to mention the clubs& bars!!
We all 26 of us would highly recommend this hotel and will most certainly be coming back again to stay.

226,Great service but at a price!,Parking pricey but nice as valet service. Beautiful hotel albeit very dark in the corridors. Staff very friendly and helpful.,5,2011,05,05
226,Fitzwillaim Hotel Belfast,Stayed in the Fitzwillaim Hotel to attend a concert. This hotel is very central and there is a secure car park across the road. The rooms are modern and the bathrooms have a separate shower and bath. We only got one little bottle of water between us must be the cut backs. The food is ok and the dining room is like a cafe long back red chairs and the tables are very close together no privicy. There are plenty of places to eat so room only is fine.,4,2011,05,04
226,fantistic hotel,"had a great time here . staff our great, food is fantistic in resturant,bedrooms our very spacious and clean. we had such a good time we asked to stay an extra night. which was no problem for them. the only complaint was the heat of the room at night.",5,2011,05,04
226,AMAZING !,"The deluxe rooms are like being in heaven. No need to leave the room, the view is so good and definitely no need to venture outside the hotel to eat, as the food is second to none !",5,2011,05,03
226,PERFECTION,"had an amazing stay, luxurious room, lovely staff and great central location. Got a complimentary upgrade and bedroom had gorgeous views of the city. would be back in a heartbeat!",5,2011,05,02
226,Best hotel in centre of Belfast,"This is a relatively new hotel in Belfast, situated next door to the Grand Opera House.  Only 2-3 minutes walk to main shopping area.  Very modern decor, but still with a warm feel to it.  Rooms are of a rather unique design.  Everything about both of our stays here has been just great and I'd highly recommend it.  Breakfast is especially good!",5,2011,05,02
226,fantastic service,"We stayed here after a family celebration in the private dining room. Right from my first ""scouting"" visit to book the dining room to the moment we checked out the service was excellent. Indeed the reason we picked this venue for our party over the other top class hotels in Belfast was the warmth which which I was welcomed and shown around on my initial visit.  The staff were superb in looking after our family - we first of all had a drinks reception, followed by a meal in the private dining room and from start to finish it was fantastic.  The waiters were truly excellent, extremely attentive without being at all ""in your face"" and we were very impressed at how ""simple things"" such as who was drinking still water and who was drinking sparking at the table were remembered and nothing ever had to be asked for twice. We are by no means experienced fine diners but it really felt like proper five star service. The food was excellent, everything was cooked to perfection and tasted amazing, a few people with somewhat conservative tastebuds were taken well out of their usual comfort zone with the available menu choices but the food was so lovely everyone was raving about it at the end. 

After the festivities we stayed in one of the junior suites, the room was lovely and the bed was so unbelievably comfortable we actually pulled back the sheets to find the make of the mattress for the next time we need to buy one at home! We loved the decor and the suspended lighting and the little touches such as the tealights and matches were lovely.  The one thing that we didn't like was the air conditioning - being at the top of the building, the room was oppressively warm and we had to put the aircon on - the unit is almost over the bed and was extremely noisy, even on the lowest fan setting.  It also switched on and off automatically so rather than making a constant noise, it would kick in with a loud ""click"" then whoosh very loudly before scaling back to a less loud (but still very noticable) whirring. Although we slept well we found it difficult to doze in the morning such was the noise. A minor drawback on what was otherwise an excellent stay. Besides the aircon though, we did not hear any other noise, not a peep from any other guests. We had a room service breakfast which was excellent, piping hot and arrived very quickly indeed. We also availed of the valet parking which was great and the car was ready and waiting for us as soon as we had checked out.  Although we are locals, we will definitely be back if we can find any more occasions to celebrate (or else we will simply make up some occasions!)",5,2011,04,30
226,Very well taken care of,"Lots of attention paid to us, well appointed rooms. Excellent price.",4,2011,04,28
226,"Wonderful hotel, great room, great service.","Great city location, very welcoming. Found the room excellent, most comfortable bed I;ve ever slept in. Can't wait to go back!",5,2011,04,26
226,Wonderful!,Had a corner room which was the best!  Could see the city.  They were very helpful from parking car to directions.  I think you really need to pay the extra to park in their garage which is valet parking only. Don't know where you could park.  Great location:  City center only a few blocks away and famous Crown Pub only two blocks.  Have a very small exercise area but didn't seem to be used much.  Only suggest is that I like softer beds and duvets are nice but get hot so sheet would have been great!  Might have been one but I didn't ask.,5,2011,04,26
226,wonderful as always,"There is never a time we come and are dissappointed.The service as usual was impecable ,the staff are always so professional but still friendly and the whole experience recharges a tired weary soul.I espicailly love the tealights,that little touch just makes it very special",5,2011,04,26
226,Excellent,I stayed for one night for wedding anniversary on arrival we received a glass of champagne which I thought was a nice gesture from the hotel and a great start to our stay.both the meal that night and breakfast next morning very nice. Car parking service great..overall great stay..,5,2011,04,26
226,Amazing hotel!!!!,"One of the best hotels I have ever experienced! The food, service, decor was just fantastic I will be staying here on my next trip to Belfast without question.",5,2011,04,25
226,Worth a Visit,"Stayed with my wife to treat ourselves to a relaxing night and we were not disappointed,from the time we stepped into the hotel lobby,we were greeted by very friendly and professional staff,relaxing atmosphere with fresh flowers and candles and suttle lighting that added to our relaxing experience,the bedroom well decorated, fresh orchids and candles around the room with finishing touches of 5 star quality such as the mini bar,our dinner was a treat, we opted for a complete fish dinner to start with Scallops/pork Belly and my wife ordered the  Smoked Salmon and for a main course we both had the Halibut,both courses were cooked and presented perfectly,the service  was impeccable,very friendly and professional staff.",5,2011,04,24
226,Excellent Hotel in great location,"We spent three nights here in April 2011. Two at the start of our holiday and the third, a fortnight later, at the end.
First class location, right in the centre of Belfast, next to the Grand Opera House, a few minutes from the Europa bus station (handy for buses to Belfast City/George Best airport) and for everything that lively city has to offer. Very modern. Excellent service throughout from genuinely friendly, knowledgeable, and helpful staff. Pretty good facilities, comfortable seating area with books and newspapers by the fire just off the lobby, good restaurant and fairly good bar.  Internet via wi-fi, or TV (¬£6.75/hour). Rooms comfortable, standard size, good bathrooms, comfortable  bed. One of those autocharge minibars. Air conditioning a bit noisy on occasions though.
Good value package comprising accommodation, dinner (from set menu, supplement payable for al a carte) and decent breakfast.. Good service in the restaurant. Very good cheeseboard by the way - cheese served by a knowledgeable and enthusiastic waitress the last night we were there. Good wine list too. Good breakfast menu. We found the quality of the food varied - while it was good overall we thought there was scope for improvement. Above all else however, of the three hotels we stayed at during our trip, the Fitzwillian scored highest for service.....and that made it a pleasure to stay there. We have no hesitation in recommending it and will certainly be using it again on a future trip to Belfast.",5,2011,04,23
226,"Great location, comfortable room. I'd stay there again!","I really enjoyed my stay in this hotel. It is very central, the staff is very nice and helpful, the bar is awesome. The restaurant is really good, even though I did not like my dessert. The grand opera house is next door, which makes the location of the hotel even better!",4,2011,04,19

226,absolute perfection,"having arrived in belfast early wednesday morning we came straight to your hotel we had previously booked on the off chance our room would be available at 8.00 am which of course it does not have to be, but on arrival the desk staff gave us our room immediately which was fantastic..we then ordered room service breakfast which was on the small side but nice.the service was second to none from reception to room service. once in our deluxe room our ours lit up at the size and excellant idea of folding doors enabling the bathroom to open into the bedroom.the room was spotless and the corner view out of the floor to ceiling windows was so lovely. even the idea of matches to light the candles round the bath was an excellant touch and much appreciated.  my wife and i are very well travelled all around the world and can honestly say that apart from caesars palace in las vegas yours is the best hotel we have stayed at anywhere in the world and we have visited lots. you gave us a very large problem in our 2 day visit to belfast in the fact that the hotel was so gorgeous we didn‚Äôt want to go out and visit anywhere but that was a nice problem.please congratulate your staff that we came into contact with, desk, concierge, bar and cleaners on their 1st class service, politeness, helpfullness and smiley faces...please feel free to use our comments on your web site , credit where credit is due your hotel made our short trip and we cannot wait to return.

226,Great hotel that needs to go the extra mile if it wants 5 stars!,"Great staff , some good decor, excellent dinners, but....
We used suite 811 for 5 nights,foot stool compensated for poor couch comfort.
Very dark hallway lighting. 
Confusing room light switches.
External fan noise most days clearly heard on the 8th floor.
Noisey and poor room air con, too loud to sleep with it on.
Firm mattress and way to heavy a doona kept us hot.
The shower room window was unlocked , but that led to a very unsafe roof area!
Radio is in a cupboard , not a good position.
TV had few channels.
No one at the restaurant reception ever to meet and greet.
Lets have some good Irish bread, the morning rolls inedible!
Finally why do the staff leave the room lighting on all day,lets save it!",4,2011,04,11
226,Spot on,"We only stayed a night at the Fitzwilliam (en route to a wedding elsewhere) but would happily have stayed longer. We were impressed by the welcome we got from the front desk on arrival, the room was nicely decorated in a contemporary style and was clean and very comfortable. The location is great, very handy for shops, theatre, City Airport etc. We would definitely choose this hotel again when passing through Belfast.",5,2011,04,11
226,"Great combo of style, location and price","We did a lot of research for our trip to Belfast and narrowed it down to either The Merchant or The FItzwilliam. The Merchant was booked, so it was The Fitzwilliam by default!  This was no runner up as we were very pleased with our choice.  Check in was easy and we were given a large room which had a nice view of the city.  Loved the decor of the hotel and rooms and the bed was super comfy.  Bathroom was large with a huge shower, a separate tub, and quality toiletries.  Service was pleasant except for one of the front desk girls-she always had a scowl on her face!  The location was excellent for getting around town as much was within walking distance and buses/taxis were easy to catch.  I'd stay here again!",5,2011,04,10

I travel frequently on business and end up staying at all sorts of places, but the Fitzwilliam in Beflast in definitely my favourite. It's a fairly small hotel, not a huge number of rooms and I think that really helps - the quality of staff is particularly excellent, they're eager to help and the speed and efficiency of the whole experience is a credit to this hotel. It's ideally located for the centre of Belfast, a few mins stroll only to the shops, surrounded by eateries (although Menu at the hotels is well worth a visit). The rooms a spacious, beautifully furnished and the beds are really comfy - I manage a good night's sleep here, which I tend to struggle with away from home. Bathroom's large and luxurious and the candles are a lovely touch. Mostly though, it's the staff - they're a credit to the hotel, a special mention for Gerard on Reception - such a sweetie... Overall, you'd be silly to stay elsewhere on a trip to Belfast.",5,2011,04,04
226,overall a good choice,"This hotel had very good service, which made up for the few small issues.  The rooms were contemporary in design and clean. the bathroom was a decent size.   They brought us fresh cookies the first day we checked in.  The problems were that the temp could not be regulated.  our room was either hot or hotter.  we finally had to sleep with the window open.  I am glad the window would open.  the first evening, the maid knocked on our door at 9:25 pm to do the turndown,  unfortunately we had just arrived in Ireland that day and gone to sleep early so was not happy to be woken up by her.  The only other issue was that this is a member of the Preferred Hotel group which promised extras to its members-- we did not receive any such extras. .  It is in a good location, there is a convenience store right across the street and lots of restaurants nearby.",4,2011,04,03
226,Small rooms let the hotel down,"We were disappointed and did not have a 5* experience.  Myself and my sister had booked a twin room, which in most hotels is fine, however, we found that the twin beds could not be separated by more than a few cms, so although they had separate bedlinen we felt that we were sharing a double bed - not what either of us as women in our 40s would choose to do!  We were only glad that we hadn't been staying with someone we knew less well.  On entering the room, because of the dark furnishings and the fact that the (grey/silver)voile curtains had two tears in them, we felt immediately disappointed and certainly didn't feel we were entering a 5* room.  The table with the TV and stereo could hold very little more and when the tea tray was on it there wasn't an inch ot spare.  The bedside tables were also tiny.  To have a sofa two foot from the end of the bed and virtually no space between one bed and the wall (the only way to access that bed) meant that we constantly had to make appointments with eachother to move around the room!  In general we found the bedroom claustrophobic and no amount of folded pointed ends on the toilet roll could make up for the fact that the bath was too short  to have a bath in and that there was nowhere to place one's toilet bag in the bathroom (never mind two toilet bags!) other than the floor. Overall the size of the room affected everything and meant that we decided to eat out rather than in the restaurant.  Saying that, the breakfast the following morning was gorgeous, so we did regret not having tried the restaurant for dinner the previous evening.  At breakfast the staff were efficient rather than welcoming or warm, which was fine, but again, standard as opposed to exceptional.  As this is a city centre hotel we accept that space can be scarce, but having stayed in city centre hotels in dublin, london and new york, we know it's possible to have both space and luxury in a city centre location.",3,2011,03,31
226,Far exceeds expections even when expectations are high,"Stayed for 2 nights, food was great, service excellant, staff made you feel that your comfort was important to them. If you want a trip to Belfast somewhere central to stay with just a short walk to the shops and sights then the Fitzwilliam is the place, with a pleasent Bar  and restaurant so no need to venture out for your evening entertainment.",5,2011,03,29
226,Absolutely brilliant and outstanding welcome,"My boyfriend was came over from Scotland for the weekend and we wanted to stay somewhere special as we rarely see eachother. I checked in earlier in the day and was given an outstanding welcome by the receptionist Gerard. Genuine, friendly and professional. Absolute gentleman. As I had to go to the airport they ensured my car was looked after outside until I needed it and again were very helpful. 

The only fault was that only 1 TV channel worked but as I didn't mention it I don't feel this is a valid or just negative remark. 

Food and restaurant service was amazing. Cocktails gorgeous and a few celebrities were present so it was great for people watching. Would recommend and stay again. Fantastic.",5,2011,03,29
226,Spoil yourself and stay at the Fitzwilliam Belfast!,"I choose the Fitzwilliam and it's Studio Suite for a romantic get-away and it didn't disappoint!  We had a beautiful and relaxing weekend of leisure in Belfast!  The food, the ambiance, the staff - were all superb! Spoil yourself and stay at the Fitzwilliam Belfast!",5,2011,03,29
226,good quality,"Excellent service, very well equipped room, nice that wi-fi free, as it should be. Bath quite hard to sit in as two curved ends, fry-up as part of inclusive breakfast would be nice though b/f was very good, nice fruit. Decor may look a bit dated in a few years, but nice now. The way the doors sghut can be noisy. All m,inor points in an otherwise very good place.",4,2011,03,26
226,Wonderful Hotel.,"Beautiful hotel, all was very nice, good service.  I would have perhaps left a 5 star review, however there were electrical problems in our room and a problem with a bathroom leak that had to be addressed at 1:30 in the morning as well, both of which were fixed but were still a bit of a pain.  We would have appreciated some gesture or a formal apology for the trouble, but oh well.  Overall, a very good choice in Belfast.",4,2011,03,24
226,Magic - well done Fitzwilliam!,"Had enjoyed an anniversary meal in the restaurant last year, so was going to book a meal again for this year's anniversary. Fitzwilliam had a 'Lazy Sunday' deal - overnight in executive room, full breakfast and 3 course meal for ¬£125 for 2 people. The restaurant is expensive so this is a fab deal. Checked in mid afternoon, had a bite of lunch, went out for some shopping, and back to the bar for some fab cocktails. Fab meal in the restaurant and a nice breakfast this morning.

Great stay, helped by well trained and helpful staff  - will definitely be back to a hotel that's a great ambassador for Belfast - well done Fitzwilliam!",5,2011,03,21
226,One of the Best Hotels Have Stayed In...,"Excellent customer service from beginning to end, from reception to concierge to the staff of other services and restaurant staff. Nothing is a problem and everything is done with a smile. The rooms (ours was a superior double) was beautifully and comfortably furnished. The bathroom has a large shower and separate bath with good quality toiletries. We availed ourselves of the same day laundry service. The concierge was able help us with booking a black cab tour. The rooms are quiet and we had a nice view. It is centrally located, short walk to City Hall and almost across the street from famous Crown Saloon. Would highly recommend this hotel when staying in Belfast.",5,2011,03,21
226,Excellent relaxing stay.,"stayed at the fitzswilliam on the taste of spring offer excellent value for money,food was excellent staff couldn't be more helpfull hope to be back soon for a bit of TLC",5,2011,03,21
226,Best hotel i have ever stayed in to date,"Friendly helpful staff, beautiful decor throughout the hotel, basic room but not basic interior, fabulous, the en-suite had a bath which is unusual, best way to relax after a long day shopping and free candels, pure indulgance. Breakfast was exquisit and the surroundings beautiful.  Excellent location, close to shops. Stayed for a birthday treat and can't wait to got back, spoiled me as i don't want to stay in another hotel in belfast again.",5,2011,03,20
226,St Patrick's Day Massacre!!,We travelled out to Belfast primarily to see how St. Patrick's day took place in the city and to take in the Commitments 20th Anniversary show at the Waterfront. We booked the Fitzwilliam as first time visitors and were extremely well surprised. As we had an early flight from London we calld the hotel to see if there was any chance of early room occupation and they said they would try for us. When we arrived they said our rooms were ready and we dropped our bags off and went to enjoy the city for the day. In the evening we spent some time sampling the hotel's cocktails in the bar which were excellent! Overall our stay was excellent the hotel was great rooms excellent and in particular the staff could not do enough to make our stay enjoyable. I would definetly recommend this hotel to anyone.,5,2011,03,20
226,Anniversary  Magic,"From the moment we drove up to the front door, we were treated like royalty.  Luggage was taken from the boot and delivered to our hotel room.. Staff very curteous and friendly.  The hotel is in a great location for a bit of retail therapy. We were even given an umbrella to go shopping as it was raining.
We had an evening meal in the restaurant and the choice of food on the menu was excellant and the courses we choose were delicious.  The staff were helpful, friendly and made the whole experience magic.",5,2011,03,15
226,People do make all the difference,"Fantastic hotel. Beautiful boutique deco, mirrors and simple finishes. Excellent location right in the very city centre, with train station, Victoria Square, Cayenne restaurant and port wihin walking distance.  Free internet, very spacious rooms, giant beautiful bathrooms.  

But what amazed us most was very friendly, extremely helpful and professional staff, from the moment we walked in to the hotel, to our come back for lagguage. We couldn't be happier. They really made us feel welcome in the place and added big time to the experience. They even offered us complimentary coffee as we were collecting our lagguage from concierge. 

You can't go wrong with this place, couldn't recommend it more, by far best hotel I ever stayed in in Belfast, and one of my favorites overall.",5,2011,03,15
226,Very quiet rooms at back of hotel. Excellent food.,"The hotel is well placed in the centre. It has no particular design charm but all the staff are very friendly and helpful. We had dinner on two nights and the food was excellent. The buffet breakfast was neither as good nor as interesting. The room at the back of the hotel, although small, was so quiet that we could leave the window open. The beds were very comfortable; however, there were no chairs for the desk, until they brought them, and the lighting above the bed was irritating because you could not turn off one side without the other so I couldn't sleep until my husband stopped reading.  The bathroom, as so often, had nowhere to put make up etc. This is a very common design fault in hotels, and ridiculous, because there is always room for a large shelf. I was surprised that they only had a local Belfast newspaper. I would rate it 4 star rather than five.",4,2011,03,13
226,If in Belfast this is the hotel to stay,"We stayed here for a weekend and we absolutely loved the hotel. It was very clean, rooms beautiful, excellent service and we availed of the parking option. For ¬£17 valet parking per night it was well worth it. We were made very welcome from all the staff.

On the first night we had bar food and it was lovely. Cocktails are reasonably priced and they have a huge beer menu too.

We booked room only as we felt an extra ¬£60 for bed and breakfast option was very excessive. You can get breakfast locally for alot less.

This is a top hotel and very centrally located in Belfast",5,2011,03,11
226,"Great hotel, cant fault it.","We enjoyed feeling pampered and important from start to finish - exactly how you should when staying at a hotel. All the staff, receptionist, porters, bar staff were all very helpful and welcoming and no request was too much for them. We both love Belfast and on any future trips over the water we will definitely stay at the Fitzwilliam. It is in a great location for exploring the city and the staff cant do enough for you.",5,2011,03,10
226,constantly greeted with smiles,"My fiancee and I have just returned from Belfast city where we stayed in the technologically looking sleek Fitzwilliam hotel.  Upon arrival we were greeted with a smile and ""welcome to the fitzwilliam"" by the concierge as he took our luggage as we checked in....our room was on the fifth floor, very very large double bed, the room was spotless and the bathroom immaculate....onwards to the bar, beautiful designed cosy bar..the cocktails were fresh and out of this world and the lager was just right...the barman assisted us greatly in advice on where to eat, drink and what to see and what not to..the residents bar at the end of the night was great craic as we happened to bump into the script! turn down service was a nice touch too when heading to bed...breakfast by chef kevin thornton outrageously delicoius even with a hangover!! my tip is the omelette with ham and cheddar! the waitresses chatted to us about the night before, great craic, laughing and joking at breakfast! everyone at this hotel, receptionist, concierge, barmen and women, cleaners, chefs, waitresses, everytime, always approached with a smile and appeared to have a real interest in us..will without question be staying here again on our next visit to the beautiful city of belfast....10/10...also if your doing belfast city tour, book it through the concierge, a courtesy bus will collect you at the front door and bring you to the tour bus, great service, and an exceptionally brilliant city tour..one negative as such, parking is 17 pounds per day...drove around the local area and all carparking is similarily priced.",5,2011,03,10
226,Grand pretensions poorly thought through,"I booked a room with disabled access, making it clear I was on two crutches and that my wife wanted a bath and I needed a shower. We also booked valet parking. The receptionist was impossible to understand and respondedvto requests to repeat something more slowly by speaking more quickly. She was not local. The requested room, which had taken two phone calls to book, was 70m from the lift (not easy on two crutches), had no bath but did have a disabled shower with fold-down stool. Little point in romantic in-bathroom candles! The room was very brown, masculine and corporate, comfortable, clean, roomy and entirely unmemorable with a view of roofs and an air conditioning unit. The restaurant was expensive, with slow service, unkowledgeable staff and mediocre food. Dinner was an expensive mistake and breakfast, while more energetically served, was an expensive mediocrity. Full marks to the door staff for help with luggage and valet parking (although the latter is not cheap)",3,2011,03,08
226,"Extremely helpful and accommodating staff, great location and a bit of class at great value.","I made this booking for a hen night and wanted something with a bit of class instead of tack. We had a b&b with evening meal package and it was amazing value for such a nice hotel. The staff could not have been more helpful, both in the lobby, at front desk, and in the restaurant.  There was a 30min delay on 2 of our party's rooms being ready but that was the only minor hiccup in an otherwise excellent stay. The breakfast was delicious, with hot food made to order off the menu and an excellent cold buffet.
I will definitely stay there again and recommend it to anyone.",5,2011,03,08
226,Dont expect an upgrade,"Great spot, great food and drink. However-staff dont have enough initiative to see when they have someone looking to stay within the hotel for their whole stay-spending all their money there etc on their engagement...and look after them accordingly. Still, very nice, but expect ANYTHING for nothing, literally.",4,2011,03,07
226,Exceptional service and 5-star indulgence at affordable prices,All of the staff have obviously received superb training and display a willingness to go the extra mile to assist and facilitate you. I was really bowled over by the quality of service and attention to detail. The rooms are modern and fresh and  the beds luxurious. Instant free wi-fi and a good sized desk meant I could readily  sneak in some work while my wife wasn't looking. The hotel is extremely well-maintained and has a fine bar with sky sports on tap. For now at least the rooms are keenly-priced and for me this hotel is streets ahead of the opposition on all counts.,5,2011,03,04
226,Look no further...,"Gorgeous hotel, ideal location, super accomodating and helpful staff who were very knowledgable about the city and gave age appropriate recommendations for our group (we were traveling with my 8 year old niece).  Thought about staying at a cheaper hotel as we were really only using the room to sleep and shower, but am so glad we chose the Fitzwilliam.   After our experience I wouldn't think of staying anywhere else in Belfast.  Looking forward to checking out their sister hotel in Dublin.",5,2011,02,28
226,BEST HOTEL EVER STAYED IN,Stayed at this hotel with my wife.Had a great experience from start to finish.Breakfast was amazing. The staff at this hotel really know what customer service means,5,2011,02,27
226,This has to be one of the worlds best hotels.,"I stayed here with my teenage daughter for three nights in room 802. My daughter is currently doing her A-Levels and is considering Queens University for her degree, which we visited on the second day via the appointments which had been arranged prior to our visit.

The hotel is in the centre of the city and is exceptional, the service, the professionalism of the staff the relaxing decor and the ambience of the restaurant were all excellent.

We arrived on an early flight landing at Belfast International at ten past nine in the morning. Thinking we would be unable to have a room for a few hours we arrived at the hotel around ten to drop off our bags and were immediately checked in and provided with our room.

The room was clean, the beds had been hoovered under (yes I move beds) and light fittings were clean and dust free. From being a child my mother always taught me to check mattresses, check under the bed, skirting boards, light fittings and the toilet if these are clean then the rest will be.

I have nothing but praise for this establishment, everyone was friendly, helpful and welcoming. Breakfast was delicious, we were never kept waiting and were immediately taken to our table and offered tea or coffee. Hot food was hot and well presented. We didn't have an evening meal in the hotel, but went to Deans twice which is almost next door. Deans was very good, my daughter choose Nando's on the first night which was reasonable, but nothing to write home about.  

I tought the gym was an after thought if you can call it a gym. One excercise cycle, one running machine and one bench. that's it three items. All in a tiny room, there is no pool, sauna or other facilities so why pretend to provide a gym. An establishment of this standard should either do it properly or not bother.   

An excellent hotel.",5,2011,02,27
226,ULIMATE RELAXATION,"My stay in Fitzwilliam was excellent from the moment we checked in, everyone was so nice.  The Hotel is very high standard, the rooms are gorgeous, the restaurant is very nice and food was excellent.",5,2011,02,25
226,Very nice hotel to visit city,Hotel is on a very central location but not in a busy (night) area. Rooms are well equiped and badroom is very nice. Food is nice.,5,2011,02,23
226,Modern hotel in a good location,"We had a great stay at the Fitzwilliam.  The hotel is in a good location for shopping and sightseeing in the centre of Belfast and there are plenty of bars and restaurants nearby.  The service was excellent and we had some gorgeous cocktails in the hotel bar.  The rooms are nice and spacious however i felt the room was perhaps a little overpriced compared to some of the other hotel deals we had seen, especially as breakfast was not included.",4,2011,02,20
226,Thank you,Thank you for good hospitality.I checked in 10am traveling from US by way of Dublin airport. I was able to take a good rest  which I did not expect .,5,2011,02,20
226,The Fancy Fitz was perfect for a Girls get away!,"I had friends visit Belfast and we all decided we'd stay in a fancy hotel even though I live in North Belfast. It was a lovely stay and close to everything we needed. It was between this and the Merchant Hotel. 

The reception staff aren't particularly pleasant, I found them to be a little off and when spending that amount of money I expect practical sycophantic service!

The rooms themselves are beautiful, well decorated and full of light, bathrooms big and the shower just lovely. Complimentary coffee, tea and water provided as expected. It was pretty sound proof and we didn't hear any other guests throughout the night  or early in the morning. I have to say the beds and bedding was sumptuous and it was a fabulous nights sleep!

The concierge service was on the button with taxis and luggage hold available. 

The Hotel itself is close by all bars and clubs, and shopping with just a short taxi ride to anywhere else. On the doorstep of the opera house. 

I'd go back!",4,2011,02,20
226,"Fantastic Hotel, and great value at the price","Wonderful service. One thing I would say is that there is no ""value"" option on the food menu but you don't come to the Fitzwilliam for value - you come for the wonderful service and it surpassed my expectations. The staff are clearly highly talented and very well trained and very welcoming for a first time visitor to Belfast. The hotel decor itself is superb and my room itself was fantastic value (although it was a weekday when I stayed). I simply can't fault the cleanliness, service, staff, room's furnishings etc etc. Fully recommend to anyone in town who wants a relaxing stay in a top of the range hotel.",5,2011,02,19
226,Perfect stay in every way,"My husband took me here as a surprise for my birthday - we only stayed 1 night but it was brilliant.  When we entered the hotel our bags (including my yhandbag and shopping bags) were taken by the porter/concierge whilst we checked in.  The staff were very friendly and informative.  He then took our bags to our room with us.
The decor was lovely, bed very comfy and bathroom fab.  
We had a meal in the restaurant and the food was great! we then had cocktails in the bar which were lovely.
When we arrived back to the room that evening the bed had been turned down which was nice as you dont really get that anymore.
Breakfast the next morning was included in the deal and you got to order anything on the menu -all of it was really nice ( I had the usual continential and then went for lovely pancakes - yum - my husband has eggs benedict which he said was really good).
All in all the hotel was perfectly located, staff very friendly and informative, bed and room great,  food brilliant. 
I would highly recommend this hotel to anyone looking to treat themselves.",5,2011,02,18
226,"""A modern day remake of 'Faulty Towers'...""","I booked two non-smoking rooms (1x Twin and 1x Double) for a Christmas party. At check-in the receptionist stated our rooms weren‚Äôt quite ready but should be available in 10 minutes. Puzzled to understand why a city centre 5 star hotel hadn‚Äôt their rooms ready at 6:00pm I said to the girl we‚Äôd wait in the bar. She mentioned she would come to us and bring our room keys but that it would only take a few moments for the rooms to be cleaned. 45 minutes later I went to reception for the second time explaining we needed our rooms as we still needed to get showered and dressed to meet our guests in The Europa Hotel in less than 20 minutes. As it happens, the rooms were ready but the receptionist forgot to bring our keys to us! Waiting for the lift I had at this point already made my mind up about Belfast‚Äôs Fitzwilliam Hotel‚Ä¶ When my work colleague and I sprinted to our room, I opened the door to be welcomed with the dreadful stale smell of smoke!!!... and the bed was a DOUBLE?¬†

We closed the door and rushed to reception again and explained we had been given the wrong room. Without much of an apology we were instantly given what we thought was the correct room this time. With no time to spare we open the door to find the non-smoking room was yet again a DOUBLE room!! Exhausted from rushing back and forwards exchanging rooms, I started to feel like an extra from a modern day remake of ‚ÄòFaulty Towers‚Äô. I call reception from the room and calmly explained the situation. The receptionist stated that there were no more rooms left but she would send someone to separate the double bed into two singles. After the call I checked the bed to find that it was one complete bed with no joins. With no time to spare we quickly got dressed (no time to shower) and left for the evening.

I won't bore you with the rest on this story but let's say it didn't end well. I never did get the room I booked and paid for. The standard of rooms were fine but the service and attitude was terrible. There are much better hotels at a fraction of the cost less than 300 metres away which offers the level of customer service you might expect from a professionally run, city-centre hotel.¬†

Sometimes you DON'T get what you pay for...",1,2011,02,17
226,Superb,"We enjoyed an excellent stay at the Fitzwilliam hotel, the room was very clean and we didn't even need to bring toiletries because they were already provided. The room was spacious and the king size bed was so comfy I didn't want to leave it. The staff were excellent, they were very helpful and nothing was too much trouble for them. I don't live far from the fitzwilliam but I thought it was be a nice treat and a treat it was, I will definitely be staying again.",5,2011,02,17
226,Excellent stay with friendly staff,"Stayed for first time and could not fault the whole expierence. Brilliant location, car parking close by and Belfast on the doorstep. Very Very friendly satff made it feel that it wasn't a hotel in a very positive way. Food standard and service more akin to a first class independant restaurant than a hotel. No hesitation in recommending and will return ourselves",5,2011,02,17
226,Great hotel,"We stayed at the hotel for Valentine's night. I was nervous after reading some of the reviews but we had a lovely time. The room was good ( a little warm initially but the room had air conditioning so we were ablre to recify that), the food was good and in our experience the service was excellent. We will definitely be back.",5,2011,02,16
226,absolutely lovely,Room was wonderful and very romantic.  I chose this hotel after Trip Advisor reviews and they were right on target.  We did have trouble with parking then learned when we checked in we were suppose to pull to the curb at the side of the hotel and the bell boys would park us for 17 pounds.  We parked across the street in a parking garage for 14 pounds.  This hotel is in the happening area of Belfast.  You can walk to everything.  I would walk to a restaurant as we did not enjoy that part- A bit fancy but expensive and did not taste good.  Bed was most comfortable hotel knows the details even provide umbrellas for guest use.,5,2011,02,15
226,A True Honeymoon Treat!,"Everything at the Fitzwilliam was truly spectacular...the room, location and especially the service.  The staff are excellent, and truly cater to your every need without being intrusive or stuffy.  We will definitely be staying at the Fitzwilliam the next time we visit Belfast!",5,2011,02,15
226,"staff were fantastic, accommodation great, simply a cut above the rest.","The staff at reception were fantastic, nothjing was a problem. The car was parked by an extremely well mannered chap and booking in was carried out in the most professional manner. The room was very clean and spacious. The breakfast next morning was a real treat and again the staff were fantastic.",5,2011,02,14
226,"Lovely rooms, good value & very helpful staff","Although I found the hotel difficult to find in the dark it is in the main centre of the city next to the opera house. Parking is valet, so they park it for you which I found really useful as a woman travelling on her own arriving in the evening. Rooms are big, lovely King Size bed, very unique interior design. Lovely shower with large pan head. I used the room service menu, which was adequate and service was quick. Staff within the hotel were genuinely very helpful and I would definately recommend.
Breakfast also a good choice.",5,2011,02,14
226,"Dont stay here, its a total shambles","I recently visited this hotel for a romantic valentines overnight package. It was a love love deal. This included an executive room, 4 course meal,free cocktail and breakfast. The renowned resturant in which we were to have our meal was so bad from start to finish. On arrival we asked for the wine list which never came! EVER! The starter was good but I asked for water and a bottle of beer, again they never came, even though I asked twice. We soldierd on and the main course arrived, slightly cold! Dessert  followed which was ok. The fourth course was two Irish coffes. We waited over 35mins and they never came. The staff never seemed bothered in the resturant so I complained down at reception. They said they were sorry but the attitude was, if you dont like it, TOUGH. Upon checking out, I mentioned it again and they didnt even know what I was on about. Total lack  of communication. I would never go back to this hotel, big reputation for nothing. I am not hard to please but when you pay ¬£85 for a four course meal and only get 3 courses, it a bit of a joke. No refund either!",1,2011,02,13
226,comfortable and relaxing,friendly service and reasonably priced.  the room is clean and quiet.  the wake up call is courteous.,5,2011,02,13
226,What a pleasure to really enjoy a business trip!,"My colleague and I really enjoyed our night at the Fitzwilliam. The bedrooms had everything we needed. They were spacious, stylish and very clean. The staff were excellent - helpful, friendly and very well informed. The evening meal and the breakfast were both very good. Overall, a really pleasant experience",5,2011,02,13
226,"Romantic long weekend away - the atmosphere at the ""Fitzwilliam"" was perfect ...","Staying at the Fitzwilliam made the weekend, the room was an impressive size, well designed, clean and had everything we expected and more. The food was incredible with the menu on offer at ""MENU"" its Michelin star restaurant living up to the expectations, the bar lively and just the place to either start or finish a night out. 

They say people make the place, if so then the Fitzwilliam has it all - they were courteous, well mannered, always wanting to help with no problem to large or small, all in all the staff were straight out of the top drawer and put a smile on your face as soon as you met them.

If you're looking to stay in Belfast in the future, check out the Fitzwilliam it has everything you want from a short stay in a city and more...

We didn't want to come home...",5,2011,02,08
226,Luxurious perfection,"We stayed at the Fitzwilliam the last weekend in January, after we had to postpone our pre-Christmas trip due to the snow.  It was fantastic.  The staff welcomed us and we were able to check-in to our room despite the fact we arrived at the hotel early.   
The location is perfect for a weekend break, and the rooms are just what you would expect from a 5* hotel, perfect for post shopping relaxation.  
The only down side of our stay would be the service in the bar before we ventured out for our evening meal.  Admittedly the bar was busy, but the bar manager (we assume this person was, as they were dressed differently to the other bar staff) seemed more intent on playing at Tom Cruise than monitoring the level of service customers were receiving.  Our glasses of wine did seem to sit on the bar for some time.
This is only a minor fault however, in what was a blissful weekend break, in a great hotel with friendly and welcoming staff.  In fact we liked it so much we're off to try Dublin next week!!  Breakfast is great value too.",4,2011,02,05
226,Great location and trendy,"Stayed one night for shopping visit. Very trendy, clean and perfect for what we wanted. The food was very nice, especially desserts. Little expensive, would prefer to have stayed in slightly cheaper accommodation, as we were out a lot,",4,2011,02,01
226,Excellent hotel - 5star chic,"This hotel excels in every area. The rooms are spacious and the design is unqiuie and modern. Its locations is central, staff are genuinely friendly, the restaurant and bar caters for all your needs",5,2011,02,01
226,Great hotel in good location,"Stayed one night at the Fitzwilliam Hotel when over in Belfast for a brief visit. The hotel is in a great location, very central and near lots of sights, restaurants and bars. The rooms were modern and the beds were really comfortable. The service was great, everyone was very friendly and helpful. We had a problem with our TV which we couldn‚Äôt get films on. The concierge tried hard to fix it, but was unable to, so offered to move us to a different room. We decided not to move but were impressed by the length to which they went to try to resolve issues. Breakfast was freshly cooked to order, which I find much nicer that the buffet style hot breakfasts you get in a lot of other hotels. We went down early and had no issues with queues. Overall I was very impressed and would stay there again.",5,2011,01,31
226,worst customer service ever experienced!,"On arrival our expectations were high as the Fitzwilliam is advertised as a 5 star hotel that‚Äôs a little bit different. Check in was effortless as expected. First impressions of our room were pleasant, d√©cor is smart and modern, exactly as we expected.

We were part of a group dinning in the restaurant at 8:15pm.As it was a group booking we had each pre ordered from a menu. Shortly after being seated we were told the menu we had pre ordered from was incorrect and we were to choose from a different menu. Some of the party had ordered Beef from the menu provided by Sherif the menu for the evening did not have the Beef option but the waiter stated as a gesture the chief would provide a sirloin of beef. 
We realised by this time that because of the mix up regarding the menu there would be a small delay with our meal but as we were all spending the evening in the hotel it wasn‚Äôt really an issue.

When our starters were served one of the party did not receive theirs and he informed a member of staff but by the time the missed starter arrived  the rest of our plates were being collected.
Not a massive issue and mistakes happen. 

The main course was served and those of us who ordered steak cooked medium found that it was relatively cold but were not given the opportunity to raise this with the staff. I say the staff as oppose to our waiter or waitress as we seemed to be served by someone different each time, and no one appeared to take ‚Äòownership‚Äô of our table.

We each ordered our desert from the selection, 45mins later when they arrived, the waitress noticed we had no cutlery and was clearly embarrassed by the situation and she quickly returned personally with the cutlery only to realise two of our party had not received their desert. Again as with the starter it was approx ten minutes before this arrived and the rest of us were having our plates cleared.
One of our party had the misfortune of finding a paper napkin in a scoop of ice cream. An appalling experience but then to be told by the restaurant supervisor that there is no way you found it in the ice cream is truly offensive. The lady in our party left the table in tears. 

The food on the whole was ‚Äòok‚Äô but the service and attention provided was extremely poor. To add to the poor experience the restaurant supervisor lacked manners and was unable to deal with a difficult situation. 

When our party left the restaurant it was approx 11pm. After the organiser of our group had a frustrating discussion with the restaurant supervisor who at one point stated ‚ÄúI won‚Äôt discuss this with you here‚Äù and walked away.  He eventually admitted there had been in his words ‚Äôissues‚Äô and discounted our drinks bill and provided a round of drinks free of charge. 
Under normal circumstances this would have been a satisfactory gesture but the fact it took over 15mins discussion with a man who had no respect for his guests and clearly provided the gesture grudgingly made anything he could provide irrelevant.

The following morning I got in the shower to find a clump of red hair on the tiled wall. I was so disappointed I went to the trouble of photographing it and used the bath instead.

My partner and I went to the restaurant for breakfast. When we exited the lifts there was a queue of 8 couples. We joined this queue and stood for a further 27mins with no information or apology from any of the restaurant staff. One lady in the queue eventually walked into the restaurant and noticed a considerable number of unoccupied tables when she raised this with a staff member she was told ‚Äúwe do not have the staff to set any more tables‚Äù 
After no explanation or guidance from the restaurant staff the couple behind us in the queue went to the hotel reception to ask to speak with the hotel duty manager. 
Eventually we were seated we immediately ordered a pot of coffee and toast. This quickly arrived but with no cups or butter it was of little use. My partner immediately asked for cups and butter and after 5mins she had to get up from the table and asked a different waiter, a further 7 mins passed before we got any cups or butter, the waitress said she was embarrassed because she had listened to so many complaints.

After sending our complaint to the General Manager we received a response a few days later .We were even more horrified by his lack of concern for the experience we had encountered as this supposed 5star accommodation! Need,ess to say we will not be returning to the Fitzwillaim and neither will we be recommending to friends!",1,2011,01,30
226,fab fab fab,"this is by far the betst place I have ever stayed in. the service was second to none and you where left with a feeling of being a princess... the rooms could not have been more beautiful, clean tidy everything you could possibly want is taken care of with no stress.... i will use this hotel again and again i wish i could live there.",5,2011,01,30
226,Very Disappointing,The overall experience of our weekend at this hotel was very disappointing. The directions on the website for driving to the hotel take you to the point where you can see it but don't then mention that you have to navigate the one-way system to get to where you can park. There is no parking as such so you have to pull up on the street outside. The heating didn't work in our room and despite notifying reception nothing was done about it until very late on the 2nd night (when we were offered a heater or new room). There was a 40 minute wait for breakfast on Sunday morning and a very empty and messy buffet when we did get in. Dinner was poor and dessert wasn't included in the accommodation and dinner package! Best thing about the weekend was the black cab tour we organised ourselves.,1,2011,01,26
226,Lovely hotel & great location- just some small concerns,"Firstly I would certainly recommend this hotel. Very modern and good value for the high quality. Our rooms certainly had the 4+*  look and feel- the high standard was especially seen in the bathroom which was luxury. Both the bath and shower (seperate) were big enough for two! Outside the room the bar was also nice and relaxing where we enjoyed some good cocktails. Furthermore the food was very good (if not a little pricey).... The location was also excellent with the city centre a matter of mins away. 

The main concern being the staff. All nice enough and very friendly but not very 4/5*. Att dinner we waited far too long between courses and for some reason hide our bottle of wine at the end of the row... (we couldn't reach the wine- and no one offered to top it up). The breakfast 'buffet' is very poor but the cooked breakfast was nice. However on Sunday morning it a disaster (so busy) and check out was not any better. I think more staff are needed or at least better training but I will return on the understanding this may well be 'teething' problems considering how recently the hotel opened.",4,2011,01,24
226,very disappointing,"Check-in , arrived 14.30 rooms not as requested. eventually got into the room at 16.30.  Rooms adequate, We had to feel around in the dark to find the key card slot for the.. electric. The lighting in the room very poor, no room in the bathroom for applying makeup etc. We had booked a meal in the restaurant.  Menu VERY DISAPPOINTING.  some of the Goats Cheese starters orderd, arrived without the goats cheese!!   We did geet an apology and (when I suggested it ) a free bottle of wine.  Breakfast was a disaster. We ordered tea and coffee at least 4 times  it arrived luke warm. I asked to speak to the Manager, she explained that the boiler was not getting a chance to boil properly because of the number of guests having breakfast!! we asked for toast vwhich arrived after about 15mins and was only toasted one one side. The Ulster fry is easily the worst I have ever had.  Check- out was the final straw.  We were billed for car parking, tea,coffe and pastry which we did not have. We were also billed 1pound each for charity. 
Whilst I don't mind giving to charity, I do like to be asked before any money is deducted.",2,2011,01,23
226,Ideal location for visit to Grand Opera House,My wife and I stayed at the Fitzwilliam Hotel on 19th January to tie in with a visit to the Grand Opera House. The location was ideal as the two are side by side and you have just 15 yds to walk outdoors. The hotel staff were very welcoming and the room was very comfortable with everything you could require. The breakfast was very good and we left next morning feeling very pleased with our choice of overnight accommodation.,5,2011,01,20
226,Will stay here when I return to Belfast without question!,"Everything about this hotel is top notch.  Check in was as easy as it gets-  during my entire stay all of the staff were more than helpful.  The rooms- as a warning- are decorated in a modern style (which I don't normally go for) but everything was tasteful, well thought out and comfortable, by the time I left I actually liked it.  Sheets were great and the bed was very comfortable.  Bathroom had a tub and seperate shower stall- great hot water and exceptionally clean.  Housekeeping did a great job making up the room at odd times when I was out... room was always spotless.  The bar was nice and had a great staff as well- after a certain time it is hotel residents only but it seems to get just as busy then. Overall I had no complaints and cant really think of anything I would change!!",5,2011,01,19
226,Stylish Hotel WIth Pleasant Staff Located Centrally,"Stayed in a suite in The Fitzwilliam and found it comfortable and stylish. The room was well thought out and the views over the city good. Nice reception, pleasant staff and centrally located. 

The only slight problem was that the mini-bar was empty as it was not working but this was more than made up for by the staff who happily delivered even one bottle of diet Coke to make up for it. Had room service also and the food was excellent. The bread with balsamic dips was top class and the chips which came with the burger were excellent. 

Wouldl visit again without hesitation.",5,2011,01,18
226,"Extremely relaxing surroundings,great staff, good location","Excellent hotel for city stop-over, staff very helpful,special mention to Gareth Byrne, from the restaurant,carries out his duties to perfection, enjoyable breakfast, no hestitation in recommending this hotel.  Added bonus, great cocktail list!",5,2011,01,17
226,OK HOTEL  - BUT NO ATMOSPHERE AND PITIFUL BREAKFASTS!,"Overall experience was ok, however I doubt I would stay here again.  Unlike the Europa Hotel down the street, the Fitzwilliam has no atmosphere whatsoever .The lobby and bar are both small, there is no lounge as such ‚Äì if you are expecting a buzzing-social scene at this hotel, then you will be very disappointed. 

The room was fine ‚Äì though I was disappointed that there was only a CD/cassette tape player available, for a 5 star hotel I would have expected an ipod dock at least! 

We‚Äôd booked into a twin room, expecting twin double beds ‚Äì however we only got single beds, and these were pushed right together with no room to separate.  I was with my mum so this wasn‚Äôt a problem, however if you were sharing with someone who you were not as close to, then I imagine this would be a bit of an issue.

Our window looked directly into other rooms, which was inconvenient, and you felt like you were being watched unless you had the curtains closed.  Indeed the room directly opposite ours had a couple who had literally just finishing ‚Äòfooling around‚Äô(with only the netting pulled across their window) as we checked into our room, so our first view upon looking out our window was to see scantily dressed people and dishevelled bed linen! We were slightly embarrassed by this to say the least.

Breakfast was t he most disappointing part of our experience. The continental breakfast is limited and the cooked breakfast was paltry! Both myself and my mum do not like eggs or black pudding, so asked for these to be omitted and expected them to be substituted with other items.  Instead we got a plate with one sausage, one (small) piece of bacon, one square of potato bread, one mushroom and half a tomato each!   The items we did not want were not replaced with extras of anything else.  Again, the Europa Hotel just down the street, offers an all-you-can-eat buffet, so at least you can get a decent, full breakfast!",3,2011,01,11
226,lovely hotel with friendly helpful staff,"This hotel is in a great location next to good restaurants, shopping and the opera house. The staff couldn't be more polite or helpful. The room was clean and the wifi came in very handy though I had to contact the (very helpful) concierge to get set up.",5,2011,01,09
226,Very good getaway with some style,"Stayed 2 nights. Hotel in great location, everything within walking distance downtown, rooms look good, more stylish than standard hotel, service was fine and friendly, used a few good facilities: bar, library by stylish lobby fire. 

Restaurant was good, though I thought menu with prepaid meal was a bit limited although no problems with quality. Also ""vegetables"" with meal proved to be carrots only. Why a chef of this reputation could not have produced something else, sothing greener for balance, instead of yet more potatoes when our main dishes already included chips and/or mash, is disappointing.

Breakfast was good, though toast took 3 attempts to arrive on the first morning.

Minor grumbles in a good stay and would use again.",4,2011,01,09
226,Best place to stay in Belfast,"I only live an hour away from the city but I used to stay in Belfast quite a lot.  Only stayed in the Fitzwilliam once but I had a great experience.  Staff were friendly, location is good, rooms are luxurious.  
I only stayed here for 1 night after a gig in the city, after an early rise for work the next day I never got a chance to try the breakfast.
It's a cheap hotel for what it is though.",5,2011,01,07
226,"Stylish sophistical hotel with lovely, indulgent rooms",We were staying for a friends wedding and had a two night stay in the hotel.  The hotel itself is tastefully decorated and the rooms are a great standard.  The nice touches of bathrobes and slippers always make a difference.  The hotel staff couldn't do enough for you from the check in staff to the bar staff.  I'd definitely recommend it.,5,2011,01,05
226,Great stay at the Fitzwilliam,"Stayed at the Fitzwilliam with my partner and Friends over the New year and have to say we had a fab time. We arrived on the morning of the 29th and our rooms were not ready but this was not a problem as we didn't expect them to be and left our luggage with the concierge, luggage already in our room on our return. It is very central and you can walk any where in the city centre. We flew from Scotland so parking was not a concern for us, but could be if you arrive by car. 
I really cant say anything negative about the hotel at all, as the standard of the rooms and public areas was very high and staff were very helpful at all times, in particular the concierge. 
We did the Black Cab tours on New Years day which was an experience and really glad we did it. The concierge arranged this for us, where they picked us up and dropped us off at the hotel and cost ¬£35. We also went to Stormount and got the bus from round the corner, think it was a 4A, which dropped us right at the front gates. On the way back we were able to get a bus from the grounds right into the city centre. 
We were booked in for B&B and had a fantastic breakfast every morning, with a really late breakfast on New Years day, which was great!! I would definitely recommend this hotel for a stay in Belfast city centre, and at the rate we got for the New Year period would say that it was very good value for money.",5,2011,01,05
226,Beautiful hotel but was disappointed with the restaurant service,"I stayed at the Fitzwilliam for one night as i was shopping in Belfast with my partner, the hotel itself was beautiful, clean and welcoming, the room was spacious and all the ammenities were in place, in working order and clean. 
The reception staff were very welcoming when we arrived and when we enquired about hotel dining times and check out etc.
the only fault with the hotel was at the restaurant, the food was delicious although my partner and i felt that the customer service level was lacking for a number of reasons
1. we ordered our drinks but had been completely forgot about and only recieved our beverages when our main course had arrived
2. the waiter spilled our side order on the table and made us pick it up, even though i'd assume the food would have been disposed of anyway so she should have picked it up
3. when given our bill we were not handed a pen to sign our gratitude and therefore we waited around a while and eventually gave up and retired to our room
4. the next morning we were sent an invoice to our room for the meal and money was taken for charity from our card, of which we did not consent for
5. with our breakfast we were asked if this was our first stay to which i replied yes and the waiter failed to inform us of the open buffet where we poured our own drinks and could choose from a range of foods
i would like to add we were apologized to for the service at dinner, although it did not lessen the disappointement i felt as my expectations were quite high for the hotel
i would return for a stay but i would avoid the restaurant in future",3,2011,01,04
226,The best hotel we have ever stayed in,"I knew that this was going to be nice, but had no idea how lovely this hotel really would be.  We stayed for New Years Eve and New Years Day (2 nights) and had an amazing time.  The hotel is beautiful, and impresses right from the moment you step into reception.  The rooms are spacious, modern and very very clean.  The bathroom is huge!  The staff are really helpful and friendly.  And as for the food.....to die for.  We ate breakfast here (decided to have it served to our room on New Years Day) and simply the BEST breakfast I have ever eaten. Cooked to perfection.  We also had dinner here that evening, and again the best steak I have ever tasted.  We eat out a lot, and this really is a truly fantastic kitchen.  I would reccomend staying here without a doubt, and if in Belfast again will stay here for sure.  Even if you live nearby I would highly reccomend coming here just for the food, as it is really that good!",5,2011,01,04
226,A very pleasant surprise,"Stayed in the Fitzwilliam just before New Year's Eve, for one night's flying visit to Belfast before driving onward into west Northern Ireland.   The hotel was very attractive: room, bar, restaurant, and pretty luxurious relative to cost.   

Particular favourites included: having separate bath and stand-up shower in the bathroom; quality of the cooked breakfasts; central location (right next to the Opera House); and valet parking.   Didn't have dinner in the hotel restaurant as there are many alternatives nearby but the cocktail bar was a great place to start the evening.

Next time I come back to Belfast, I'm staying here.",5,2011,01,03
226,Excelent hotel in the middle of town,"I spend two nights here with my wife and 5 year old son. The hotel in right in the centre of town. It's only a five minute walk to city hall and the shops. Belfast has an amazin amounts of shops including a couple of large shoppingmalls.
The room was nice and spacey. The extra bed left us plenty of room to sit and walk aroung. The bathroom was large. It had an bath and seperate shower. There was a desk with television and radio/cd player.
If you like shopping, you should try Belfast and stay in Fitzwilliam hotel.",4,2011,01,01
226,so easy,"Everything about this hotel oozes class - the staff, the atmosphere, the room.....had a terrific time and am already looking for a reason to go back.
Would recommend calling in advance to secure parking as very limited spaces available.
My only gripe was I ordered a paper for the morning which hadn't arrived but a quick call saw it delivered in 5 minutes.",5,2010,12,30
226,Fantastic Christmas Break!,"My husband and I decided to stay at the Fitzwilliam, Belfast on Christmas night as we have never spent Christmas on our own.  This was our third time staying in the Fitzwilliam, and yet again we were not disappointed.  On arrival for Christmas lunch we had a mulled wine, it was so good! (unfortunately they would not give us the secret receipe/ingredient).  Then after ordering, we had canapes, an appetisier, courtesy of the chef and then our starter, main and dessert.  I cannot recall the name of the waiter, but he was wonderfully friendly, attentive and knowledgable about the menu and the wine.  We arrived at our table at 2pm and after the exquisite dinner we had some drinks and left at 5pm.  We were not rushed, the food was served at adequate intervals and we felt we really got our moneys worth.  

We originally got a standard room which we were very happy with (given that the last 2 times we paid extra for a suite). However at about 6pm, we began to hear a humming noise which turned out to be the air conditioning units on the roof and as it was Christmas day, the caretaker was not available.  We complained and were automatically moved to a corner room with great views of Belfast.  Gemma the receptionist was wonderful in dealing with our complaint!

Breakfast on Boxing Day was excellent.  My husband had cereal and a full Irish breakfast and I had fresh fruit followed by french toast.

We are really looking forward to next Christmas as are my whole family who are itching to go to the Fitzwilliam!",5,2010,12,28
226,Nice hotel - shame about the Digital TV not working!,"We booked into the Fitzwilliam Belfast for two nights, for a Christmas shopping trip and to chill out before Christmas.  On arrival, the receptionist staff and concierge were very friendly and accommodating and we were able to check into our room much earlier than the specified check in time.  We had requested a room facing Great Victoria Street and got just what we'd asked for, which was great.  

The hotel itself is lovely in decor. The room was just as expected from online photos; clean and modern with a lovely bathroom with large walk in shower.  As the weather was very bad, we had intended to shop in the daytime and spend most of the evening relaxing in the room.  Therefore our experience was marred somewhat by the digital tv services not working, which meant that we didn't have access to the pay per view movies or any other digital tv services.  In fairness, the maintenance man tried his best to fix it, but apparently there was a problem with the tv company in England which we hoped would be rectified for the second night of our stay, but unfortunately it wasn't.  As this was one of the reasons that we had booked into this particular hotel, we were very disapointed not having this facility.  We felt that it should have been the hotels priority to get this sorted out for their guests and would expect better from a five star hotel.
  
However,  all in all, a pleasant stay at the Fitzwilliam!",4,2010,12,24
226,"We stay here regularly, but very disapointed today","We stay here at least once a month, and have always enjoyed it, never any complaints. Wehad a room booked for Dec 17th and due to bad weather the hotel changed it for us to dec 22nd even though it was an advanced payment, and today I rang to ask could we change it to Jan 7th because of the severe weather we are totally snowed in, i thought due to the fact that we are regular guests at the hotel that they would allow this, since it was out our hands, but we were told no. As regular guests we are very disapointent",5,2010,12,21
226,The nicest Hotel I have stayed in the UK this year!,"The Hotel was amazing, great location in the heart of the city, it was like staying at the Four Seasons, the room was really contemporary and clean witha very comfortable bed and designer bathroom with Walk in Shower. Free Wifi which is great for business. The Hotel bar had a great atmosphere, lovely pint of Guiness and plenty of snacks at hand. The resteraunt was really up there with the best, great food, had a beutifully cooked irish breakfast in very contemporary surroundings and great service, I was pleasantly shocked how good the hotel was. I would definetly recommend to anyone wanting a great place to stay in Belfast, business or pleasure it will surpass your expectations.",5,2010,12,17
226,5 Star Service at a good price- excellent hotel!!,the hotel is in a great location. every member of staff was brilliant. its on the map for me for every visit to Belfast,4,2010,12,16
226,Amazing hotel...,"Prior to our arrival in the hotel I rang to check what the weather was like in Belfast to make sure the roads would be ok for driving, the receptionist could not have been friendlier. We arrived earlier than normal and they had a room ready for us, the rooms and hotel itself were amazing and so clean. The staff were extremely friendly and the bar did some great cocktails! I would give the hotel 10 out of 10 but have to dock a point (or 2) for having to pay ¬£17 for parking (RIP OFF!). We had breakfast delivered in them morning aswell and I would only give this 5 out of 10, they had forgotton to put a few things on our tray.",4,2010,12,14
226,Last minute stay - great hotel!,"This was  a last minute booking.The stay was excellent.The only issue i would like to raise was having to wait over 20mins to be seated for breakfast.I appreciate that this can happen .There were 5 of us and my sister was on crutches.When we eventually got into the dining room, there were only 2 tables being used. The remaining tables were covered in used dishes so clearly not enough staff on. The service at breakfast was not good. Both courses came together.The stafff seemed hassled .One said that they had over 200 for breakfast  - this was a Sat morning so what did they expect!However, the food was great.Probably just a one off poor experience/.",5,2010,12,13
226,brilliant hotel,"My friend and i stayed only one night i wish we could afford more nights only two penshioners .The service has to be the best we haveseen  the U.K with exellent staff from checking in to restaurant to leaving our bags in luggage room they couldnt do enough for us .The welcome you get when you walk in the fire and lovely sofas .We had booked a twin room and it was very clean and bright, beds very comfortable ,lovely bathroom with fluffy towels ,slippers and bath robs what more could you ask for .Will we stay again i would hope so .Would we reccomend to others yes I would give it 10 out of 10 from you enter untill you leave.  Thank you for having us.",5,2010,12,12
226,"Excellent, relaxed atmosphere.",This is an excellent stay.  Really loved the decor and the whole relaxed atmosphere.  Staff are friendly and efficient.  Great breakfast.  I would recommend this hotel as it appears suitable for all age groups.  Will definitely return here.,5,2010,12,10
226,City centre location and proper 'made to order' breakfast,"Very happy with my stay in the Fitzwilliam Hotel. Top notch breakfast and my wife enjoyed great cocktails in the bar (served by the experienced knowledgable Andy).
Would definitely stay again",5,2010,12,09
226,perfect!!,the hotel was in a perfect location for our shopping trip close to the city shops and a short walk from all other amenities. staff were very pleasant from the moment we checked in until we left seeing to all our needs. we didn't eat in the hotel but restaurant looked lovely and bar was very busy which is always a good sign. we arrived at the hotel early and were able to check in as the room was ready. I highly recommend this hotel to others and we had a very comfortable and relaxing stay there.,5,2010,12,08
226,Definitely no way 5 star,"Someone got this wrong. This hotel would not qualify for a 5 star rating anywhere . It is, at best a 4 star hotel. 
The rooms are fairly start. Furniture for the mst part is cheap and showing signs of age and wear and tear. Bathrooms are OK although not a lot of space to place amenities.
I stayed for 4 nights and was cold for 4 nihts as the room air con does not work.It was interesting to see that sheets are NOT changed daily. I checked.
When they say full breakfast is included in the rate when booking on Expedia- it isn't. A very sub standard continental breakfast is. You may pay for hot breakfast and I mean PAY. It is not cheap. neither are the hotel rates.
I will be back in Belfast in a few months and will definitely choose elsewhere to stay.",3,2010,12,07
226,No hot water in December? Come on guys sort it out,"We stayed this weekend for two nights for a wedding and had no hot water the whole duration of our stay. 

The first morning we complained about it to the concierge and were told it would be sorted. We had to leave for the wedding having only managed tepid showers which was not fun at all. 

The second morning it wasn't even tepid it was icy. The first time we rang reception about it we were told, 'well the boilers broken' and they would try to get a maintenance man to look at it and get back to us. I then rang again 20mins later as we were running out of time to check out and was told by the same person  that she was still waiting for her manager to get back to her and that even if they fix it it would take time to warm back up. 

Basically no we wouldn't be able to have showers, we got ready having only had a wash, which at ¬£130 per night is ridiculous. We complained when checking out and had to wait for the duty manager, who gave us a 10% discount, given that we did not have time to argue as we would be running late for our flight, we accepted and left.

Others things not good at the Fitzwilliam were the tiles at the base of our shower cubicle were coming away from the wall so it couldn't have been waterproof. The duvet cover had a rip down one seem and the first morning we'd ordered breakfast to our room which arrived semi warm, (this was all room 206 - which is also right next to the elevator and is noisy so if you're given this room I'd ask for another one). 

One thing that wasn't the hotel's fault was that some sort of roadwork drill started at 8am Saturday morning which was irritating. 

On the plus side when we went to the restaurant on the second morning all staff were very nice and helpful, can't really think of other plus'.",2,2010,12,05
226,Customer Service in this hotel is horrendous.....!,"Sent my elderly parents to this hotel as a hotel treat and booked half board through travel republic website. Due to the terrible weather they requested that their trip was delayed to the following week however the hotel required full payment on cancellation so they proceeded on their trip. When my parents arrived they were informed payment from the internet site hadnt been received to date and although they had a receipt were requested to pay again. My father pointed out that payment had been made and that he had a receipt and that if it hadnt been forwarded by the agent then that was an issue for them and the agent. They were then informed that although the receipt said half-board they were not entitled to dinner, only B&B, and would have to pay a further ¬£76.00 for it even though we booked and paid significantly more for the half board offer. My parents were confused but as it was a present didnt want to create a fuss. After 45 mins at reception they managed to get checked in. They opted for a more modestly priced restaurant outside of the hotel. 
 When my wife became aware that the hotel hadnt provided dinner as paid for she contacted the hotel manager. He admitted the mistake and on my parents return tried to compensate them with a bottle of wine and some cheese to their room.  We contacted the hotel manager to complain about the service provided to be informed that they had been in contact with the internet company who had agreed to refund the balance of the booking and that we had to contact them to action the refund. My parents 1 night stay had been ruined and not only this but it has been left up to us to try and sort out the problem with the internet web site. The hotel and its management have just washed their hands of the whole problem and as far as they are concerned it is our tough luck that the web site offered us a half board option that the hotel does not honour.",1,2010,12,03

226,"Great location, great staff, great service - fantastic hotel!","We stayed on a Saturday night in November. The staff were very friendly and courteous on our arrival and we were very impressed with the modern style of the room. Everything was spotless. All services were easily accessible from the room and the staff couldn't be more helpful. We have now signed up for membership at the hotel we were that impressed. We have stayed in other Belfast Hotels many times before but this hotel is in a different league! Fantastic location in the centre of town, we were able to walk to the shopping centre.",5,2010,11,30
226,A liitle bit of class in downtown Belfast,We were stranded at the airport after a flight cancellation. Checked local guide and slelected the  Fitzwiliam. I enjoyed it best sleep in ages and we enjoyed the meal. Good rooms and although a bit minimalsitic it has an appeal.,4,2010,11,30

226,"Great location, comfortable hotel, breakfast slow but worth the wait!","Stayed here recently while attending a concert in the city, and was very happy with the hotel. My friend and I requested a twin room and got one, really comfortable beds, and a fabulous and spacious bathroom. Modern yet cozy room.  

Availed of valet parking service and that was great, very fast and secure. No delay in dropping off or getting car back. 

We were early checking in and our rooms were ready, we were given keys and our bags brought up for us so we could hit the shops without delay!

The hotel location was ideal, shops close by and within walking distance. 

My only reservation was regarding breakfast which on the Sunday morning I found terribly slow. We had to ask for our coffees a couple of times and they had run out of a lot of things when we arrived down for breakfast ie orange juice, fruit etc. We were twenty mins at our table before we could order cooked breakfast, and another twenty minutes waiting for it but I will say that when it came, it was delicious! The restaurant was packed to capacity and I think they were just understaffed for a Sunday morning. 

Yes I would stay here again without hesitation, but I would make sure I was down early for breakfast!",4,2010,11,27
226,Sleep don't eat.,"The food in this hotel is not as good as you would expect from a 4 star hotel. We ate here on the night of our stay and were very dissapointed. Burnt steak, runny Creme Brulee and cold coffee left a bad taste in our mouth. The only people eating in the restaurant were those who had dinner included. I wouldn't eat here again.",3,2010,11,25
226,Inexperienced front line staff with very poor managment back up.,"Unfortunatley , our stay was marred by various amateur mistakes made by staff who struggle to live up to the Fitzwilliams self belief that they are the best hotel in Belfast. Take my advice, stay at the Malmaison.",1,2010,11,25
226,"Lovely Hotel, great location but avoid the restaurant","Great hotel, fussy on rooms but they were lovely with great shower. Lovely staff, small baby with us and they made us feel at home with the consideration for seating and directions for places to visit and where to shop. Great location for both. Car parking ¬£17-50 a night but in the centre it is to be expected, it is secure and valet parking great just leave car and enjoy. Lovely breakfast.

Only bad thing was the restaurant meal at night, not worth the money. Butter squash soup watery, milky with soggy bad tasting croutons, beef was supposed to be braised steak and all we got was bad carvery grizzle rib (farmer and butcher profession). Not up to standard. 

Apart from that would stay here again.",4,2010,11,24
226,Excellent Hotel .... would stay again,"I've stayed in Belfast many times .... will stay in The Fitzwilliam again, great location and the hotel was very nice.

226,"Fantastic, huge comfy bed; beautiful decor & very friendly staff","My sister recommended we stay here after she had stayed previously - she wasn't wrong. We had a lovely room on the corner (701) but despite being in the hub of the city we heard no traffic noise at all. We had a great sleep in the bed which was enormous. The decor of the room is lovely, very spacious with everthing you would need. We had breakfast in bed which arrived on time exactly as ordered on a trolley to our room. Staff were very friendly and always as helpful as they possibly could be. The bar is nice for a few drinks - we had a few during the day. Others sat in the sofas at reception beside the fire having champagne and cakes which looked fab!

The only thing that let the room down was that the shower wasn't very powerful and the rawl plugs fixing the toiletry holder to the tiles in the shower were visible. We didn't mention this to the hotel because we had been very happy with our stay. I would definitely stay here again.",5,2010,11,16

226,"Great location, impressive modern bedroom and bathroom.","Recommend this hotel to anyone needing to stay in Belfast city center for a night or more, who wants to be in a good location close to bars/restaurants etc.  Rooms are very modern and clean, I want the bathroom!  The black out curtains are amazing, I thought it was still the middle of the night when i woke up!  We didn't eat in the hotel because we had reservations elsewhere, but the bar was very nice.  We used the valet overnight parking which I think was around 17 quid, but well worth it, since we were then able to just pull up at the front door of the hotel.  Close to city center shopping also.",5,2010,11,13
226,The Fitzwilliam is Fabulous,"I will make this brief. My friend and I spent three nights at the Fitzwilliam, once on our arrival in Belfast before traveling to Scotland and two nights on the return before flying home. In both instances we were greeted by their very attentive staff in their wonderfully appointed lobby. The rooms that we stayed in were well kept, attractive and fully appointed. Food in both the lobby bar and the more formal dining room on the first floor was excellent. In short, we would recommend this hotel to anyone. 

Our only note is that they should provide shower/bath mats as the floor, when wet, is like a skating rink.",5,2010,11,12
226,"Very comfortable, but some reservations","Two night stay. Very good internet price (including breakfast).

I watched the Fitzwilliam being built over the last couple of years (whilst staying at Jury‚Äôs next door, and the Europa), and was interested to experience it directly. This is a very modern ‚Äòdesigner‚Äô building, using quality materials throughout. Sadly, in several small ways, our experience was a little disappointing.

Check-in was disrupted by the receptionist taking a phone call which went on far too long, leaving us hanging around after a long journey. Surely face to face customers have priority over a telephone customer? The concierge was efficient, bringing our bags to our room, and demonstrating the lighting systems (we were unsure whether he expected a tip, so this was slightly uncomfortable as we had no change). We were a little disconcerted to be ‚Äògrilled‚Äô about our reasons for visiting Belfast, and how we would be spending our time. This bordered on being mildly interrogatory rather than friendly enquiry. We had one room service meal, delivered promptly, but missing one item. Room service delivery man also ‚Äòinterrogated‚Äô us about our movements in Belfast! Too intrusive.

Our room was very comfortable, particularly the bed. No view (but not to be expected in this location); good quality furnishings and equipment. Brilliant shower. No biscuits provided in the tea/coffee tray, which is mean for an hotel of this standard. One other striking feature of the Fitzwilliam overall, is the dark/gloomy interiors. The corridors to bedrooms are very dark (anybody with a sight impairment would really struggle). It was difficult to identify room numbers as the lighting was so low. I noted that there were central corridor lights that were not lit ‚Äì¬†is this gloominess a style factor or a cost saving measure? This atmosphere extends to the breakfast room which has no natural light at all. I don‚Äôt think in all my 30 years plus of staying in business hotels that I‚Äôve ever eaten breakfast in a room with no windows.

We attended a show at the Opera House, next door. Fantastic to leave the show, and return straight back into the Fitzwilliam next door in no time at all. Do not misinterpret this review: the Fitzwilliam is a high quality, well run  hotel. My reservations are the result of the accumulation of relatively small issues. However, they are sufficient for me probably to return to the Europa for my next visit.",4,2010,11,11
226,"frist time staying in hotel,and it was excellent will stay again.","Our stay was excellent. We like the room ,very mush and the service ,was very warm and friendy. The location was great just a few minutes from everything and as i say i will stay again.",5,2010,11,11
226,Fantastic - a city centre gem,"Back home for a short break to attend a wedding. Two nights in the Fitzwilliam provided an excellent base. Friendly, courteous and professional service in every area, great food, a fantastic bar and beautiful, modern, spacious rooms make this hotel a valuable addition to the centre of Belfast.

Keep it up!",5,2010,11,09

226,Excellent hotel with great service,"This is a lovely hotel with excellent service, from the handwritten welcome card in the room to the efficiency of room service and attentive breakfast service. The room was spacious and comfortable, and didn't feel like a standard 'idenitikit' hotel room. I loved the open plan bathroom and huge windows (although the traffic starts early round here). Would definitely stay again. Thank you.",5,2010,11,07
226,Wonderful Hotel Experience,"What a wonderful hotel! The fire in the lobby was the first thing we noticed - amazing. On our last day we spent seceral hours in front of it just talking, drinking and reading - so relaxing. The room was glorious and had some lovely special features like the heated section of the bathroom mirror which never steamed up. Food in the restaurant was amazing, if a littleexpensive. We will definitley be back.",5,2010,11,06
226,"Elegant Hotel, Indifferent Service","Stayed here during October for a weekend city break with friends.  In hindsight we should have forseen the poor-indifferent service we received during our stay .  We had originally planned a trip here in April which was cancelled at the last minute due to the volcanic ash clouds at the time.  The hotel staff were pretty unhelpful when trying to cancel the booking (despite this being for reasons outwith our control).  They eventually, grudgingly agreed to let us reschedule - this despite the fact they had messed up our original booking for two twin rooms.

Anyway, our rescheduled visit in October....The hotel is undeniably elegant and and the rooms are comfortable and fitted out to a high standard.  It is also situated in a very good location for exploring Belfast.  Having said that, the room costs do reflect these features.

What really disappointed me and my friends was the service.  

Valet Parking was ¬£17 per day and we had to wait an unacceptable time for our car to be brought round - presumably because the receptionist hadn't bothered to pass on the message to the porter.  

Breakfast service wasn't great.  Buffet style for cold foods/drinks and table service for hot dishes and drinks.  On both mornings the wait staff didn't clear away empty dishes from our table - despite an abundance of staff and had to be reminded to bring additional drinks when thse were requested.

The worst part of the stay, however, was the noise that could be heard in our rooms.  We were on the second floor and on both nights there was loud, thumping music.  This could be heard from both rooms our group were staying in.  Staff were unhelpful and each different person who was spoke to about this claimed to not know anything about it, be unaware of the fact we had complained and could offer no explanation as to where the music was coming from.  No offer was made for us to move rooms or any offer compensation.  Only complimentary feature was in a follow-up e-mail offering a free upgrade at our next stay.  There won't be a next stay.

My advice, save your money and stay at one of the other, numerous, hotels in Belfast.",3,2010,11,05

226,"modern hotel with beautiful rooms, great service and a central location","my husband and i stayed here for 1 night B+B in a standard room and we were very impressed. The rooms decor was lovely, more than you'd expect for a standard. The hotel itself is beautiful inside and the staff are very friendly and couldnt do enough to help. Breakfast was very good both continental and full irish to choose from. We booked with travelrepublic and got B+B for cheaper than room only through the hotel site, so it was great value for money as well. All in all i would thoroughly recommend this hotel to anyone.",5,2010,11,01
226,Great Stay,"Stayed here for 2 nights at the end of October 2010. From the minute we walked through the door we were impressed. What a lovely, inviting lobby and reception area. We were dealt with immediately by the friendly receptionist and were in our room really quickly. The rooms themselves are really lovely with a huge, comfortable bed and gorgeous bathroom. Really nice shower. We didn't have anything to eat in the hotel so can't comment on that but we did have a couple of cocktails in the bar and it was really pleasant. The location is fantastic, straight across from the beautiful Crown Liquor Saloon and a few minutes' walk takes you right through the small city centre. All in all, will stay here again when I return to Belfast.",5,2010,11,01
226,Really good,"This hotel was ranked as five stars...I am not sure I would place it there, but it is certainly a very solid four star hotel at least.

The room was very nice and spacious, and the bed was really nice too. The location was great -- right in the city centre!

We had dinner at the restaurant -- the pre-theatre menu -- which was pretty good value for money...three course dinner with wine, bread, and sparkling water for ¬£70. The hotel itself was pretty good value for what you got -- good price, especially given that there was a major concert in town when we were there (and that is why we, and many others at the hotel from what we could tell, were there...they were really full and so the price was surprising!).

My only main complaint is that the shower in our room (we got an accessible room for some reason) did not work very well...it was either freezing cold or scolding hot, and after a few min on, only scolding hot. Made showering a bit hard! We were only there a night so not a very big deal, but for a longer stay it could have been quite the pain.

Incredibly friendly staff, particularly the girls at the reception!

Would stay again for sure if we return to Belfast!",4,2010,10,31
226,Amazing Hotel,"I would like to say thankyou to you and all your staff for giving me the most enjoyabe stay in a hotel i have ever had.  From the moment i walked in the door the receptionist was friendly and interested in me and my day, the free upgrade to a dulux room was a lovely touch.  My amazement started as soon as i walked out of the lift even the door of my room impressed, i could not wait to open it and see inside and i was not disappointed, the room was just to die for.  The view and decor amazing the open plan the bathroom and all the small touches like candles by the bed and bath robes, music, bottled water even an umberella!!!  Breakfast was ordered to the room, it arrived missing a cooked breakfast but it was quickly delivered and the tray charge wavered on checkout.  Food was gorgeous and wonderfully displayed.    I have never stayed in a hotel like it, i can't wait to stay again.  I will be raving about this hotel for a long time and will def recommend it to all my family and friends. 

Thanks again for an unforgettable experience

226,"Too many chiefs, not enough Indians!","We felt that there were too many management personnel, lacking the initiative to get jobs done. Our wait for a table at breakfast was simply down to what appeared to be inexperience of waiting staff, yet no one seemed capable of streamlining the simple clearing of tables even as a long queue was forming. When we were shown to our table, ordered tea, headed up for cereals and returned to find another couple had been given our table, so had to wait for another! Then, the restaurant was without any milk. Yet again, a lot of staff milling around, but nothing getting done. At dinner, we were asked did we want some water, I requested a jug, but we were served a bottle, which we were unknowingly charged for! On being offered bread/olives we declined, thankfully as another charge for this would have incurred without us realising. We spent the evening at The Merchant Hotel for drinks/cocktals, where we were served complimentary water, pretzels, olives and nibbles all night! A nice touch. The Europa is also more welcoming, so choose carefully.",4,2010,10,30
226,"really poor night sleep, noisy rooms on the second floor","The service could have been definitely better. I had a piece of plastic in my cocktail; the breakfast dishes weren't cleared away at the buffet style breakfast, making the table cramped for 4 people; the valet service took ¬Ω hr to bring our car and then on reporting the booming music after 12am, the staff told us that is was the Opera House next door and that this had never happened before. Overall, the staff and service was mediocre for such a splendid hotel.",3,2010,10,26
226,Looking forward already to return visit!,"Had a surprise stay on Saturday night courtesy of husband.  Rate included dinner B&B. The room was fantastic, we were very fortunate to be upgraded to suite on 8th floor. I think it might have been because the car park was full that evening and we didn't get a space. However I would take the suite over the parking space any day! It was beautifully decorated and so comfortable. We dined in the restaurant which was superb. Far superior to Shu where we dined the night before and much better value. I honestly couldn't fault anything. Menu and wine list 1st class and not a rip off. It is unusual to have a restaurant of that calibre in a hotel especially in Belfast. The staff were really lovely, every single member we came in contact with was so polite and helpful. The breakfast was delicious and again the staff were fab. One waitress remembered us from the night before and though busy took the time to enquire how we enjoyed our stay. 
The only complaint we have is the air con in the room was very noisy and when not on the room did get quite warm but it didn't ruin our stay.
Well done to the Fitzwilliam, great hotel, great staff and great restaurant ! We had a wonderful time and will be back!",5,2010,10,26
226,Very comfortable stay,We have just enjoyed a very comfortable night in the Fitzwilliam.  Well situated in the centre of Belfast we were impressed from the time we arrived with our welcome and the friendliness of the staff.  The rooms are extremely spacious and comfortable.  We had previously stayed in Ten Square and enjoyed our stays there but now much more impressed with the value of the Fitzwilliam.,5,2010,10,24
226,Fantastic hotel in the centre of Belfast,"This hotel was a real surprise to me. The design of the hotel is great. Very elegant and modern. It has real atmosphere. The service from the personnel was also top notch - very helpful and respectful. In the bar, the service was very slow, but the cocktails were very tasty!
The location is brilliant for anybody who wants to spend a couple of days in the center of Belfast. You can walk right into the main shopping areas. 
Definitely worth considering!",5,2010,10,23
226,Excellent stay,"We were able to check in early because our room was ready and slept off a bit of our jet lag. All the staff was really friendly and helped us in booking tours and finding restaurants. Special kudos to Philip the concierge who was awesome. They had a converter on site for us to use because we had forgotten ours. Lobby, bar, restaurant and rooms are all very modern. Bathroom was clean and included a tub and a standup shower. Internet was complimentary and fast. Fitness room was small, only 3 card machines and free weights, but it got the job done. Location was amazing, walking distance to basically everything.

Cons: their pillows are really hard so that was a bit uncomfortable but we made due, we tried to make coffee one morning and did it wrong and grinds went all over but the next day when we went to make it the right way, the grinds were still in the pot so obviously the maid hadn't cleaned it, our view was of a roof with heating pipes which I'm sure we could've switched if we wanted to but we didn't care too much, and breakfast is not included.

Overall really good stay though and I would stay there again if I go to Belfast.",5,2010,10,22
226,"lovely hotel, but room for little improvements","Only stayed one night to go to a function in Belfast. 

Stayed in Deluxe room with big floor to ceiling corner window, which is very impressive, good for people watching! 
Check in was fine, no queues. Corridors are a bit dark, but its just the design. Rooms were very well cleaned, but a little worn, chipped paint work, stain on carpet at sofa. Sofa and beds very comfortable. Good TV and sound systems, didnt ask for CDs etc but they were available. 
Bathroom was spotless, great shower and lovely bath feature as it can open out into the main room. facilities like hairdryers, tea and coffee as you would expect. 

The hotel lobby is lovely, big fire, plenty of seats, nice relaxed atmosphere.

Didn't use the bar.
Breakfast staff very efficient, but a bit discappointed re cold toast and luke warm coffee. I'm sure it would have be rectified, but we didn't mention it. Breakfast hot food was really delicious. Breakfast room was busy but not too crowded.

Staff very efficient at all times, even at checkout when everyone was a bit stressed due to a fire alarm.
Dont know if this is one of those hotels where alarms are a recurrent issue, but it did go on a long time. Had to go up fire exit from breakfast to the 5th floor, then back down with bags to check out, and it was still going. This was after work men had been digging up the road outside from before 8 am!!- not much hotel could have done re that, and probably we were in a room that got most of the noise as we paid for the deluxe room!

Would definately use again, but only for a treat as there are cheaper options for a night in the city.",4,2010,10,20

226,Save your money and go elsewhere,"We picked the Fitzwilliam as it looked swish (it was a girls treating ourselves weekend), wasn't cheap (we wanted to avoid stag and hen parties) and was centrally located.    We had a problem with the initial booking as we thought we'd booked two rooms on-line (as we had different confirmation numbers), but it turned out that only one payment was processed.  When we realised this and phoned, they didn't honour the initial rate and we had to pay approx ¬£100 more for the second room.  On arrival, the check-in service was fine and the rooms are spacious and nicely decorated. The (expensive) breakfast was good, but service was lacking e.g. after 20 mins having ask the waitress to remove empty plates. (You would struggle to get breakfast locally on a Sun morning.) We also paid upfront for the valet parking at ¬£17 per night, (on one occasion it took them 30 mins to get the car for us).  There is a car park around the corner which only charges ¬£14 and plenty other cheaper ones within a 10 min walk.  Our rooms were on the 2nd floor, next to the lifts.  Both on the Fri and Sat nights, we were subjected to blaring rave music until 1:00am.  When we complained to reception, one member of staff suggested it was the bar in the Opera House (which is next door), but the assistant manager advised that no-one had ever complained about the noise before.  No apology or offer of compensation.  Belfast is a great city and I would recommend the hop on hop off bus tour, the free tour of city hall, visting the Ulster museum and botanical gardens and eating at Mourne, Thai Village and lunch in Avoca.  I just wouldn't recommend staying at the Fitzwilliam Hotel.  The Jurys and the Europa Hotel are either side of the Fitzwilliam, and I would suggest that you try those hotels.",3,2010,10,14
226,"Great service, great location and lovely rooms","In general, the staff are helpful and friendly.  The location is spot on and close to the centre.  The rooms are stylish and comfortable.

Bathrooms a little on the small size with not too much room for your toiletries/make up etc.  Good bar - great cocktails!  Very good location.  Hotel parking limited so you do need to reserve ahead but it is very expensive.  There is a public car park just opposite the hotel which is less expensive and which I would use if we were staying there again.,4,2010,10,08
226,Fabulously friendly hotel in central location.,"From the minute my husband and i arrived at this tastefully decorated hotel we were met with proffesional and friendly treatment by the well trained staff. The room was very comfertable and spotlessly clean with a larger than usual bathroom. The hotel is in a central possition, within walking distance of the centre of town and most of the tourist attractions. We also had breakfast on each of the four mornings of our stay, it was grade A with plenty of choise and table service which is unusual, usually buffet style in most hotels. I would not hesitate to reccomend this hotel to anyone interested in a trip to Belfast.",5,2010,10,07

Friendly staff who treat you as an individual, spacious rooms with good quality furnishing and linen, valet parking that doesn't require a week's notice to get your car back, good restaraunt at non-exhorbitant prices and a well stocked bar. A great central location too. Downside? The windows in the bar are too small for my liking!",5,2010,10,01
226,"Great decor, great location, great service!",A really comfortable room with excellent facilities - nothing seemed to have been overlooked. The bathroom was well designed with a quality finish - the whole experience was most enjoyable.,4,2010,09,30
226,Disappointing!,"We booked and paid several months ahead for a two night stay. First impressions were very good - car parked and luggage attended to cheerfully and promptly, foyer slick and airy, our room also appeared stylish and comfortable.  Heading to our rooms, however, we were put off by the extremely dark corridors.
 As we unpacked and settled in, we realised that we had been given a ""wheel-chair friendly"" room. The cavernous bathroom had little or no shelf space, the only towel rail was far too short and  low, and could only be accessed by reaching over the open toilet, as there was no seat cover.  The (very small) hand basin, too, was at knee height.  There was no shower screen, so water went everywhere when in use, and there was nowhere to put towels, clothes or toiletries within easy reach and away from the spray.  (Wouldn't this also be a problem for a disabled guest?) Furthermore the drainage from the shower was sluggish, resulting in a lot of water on the floor.  On raising this issue with the concierge the next morning,  we were told it was the only room available given that the hotel was full - not satisfactory given we had booked so far in advance.  At a later stage we were  given the opportunity to change rooms, but we declined as we had already unpacked and had only one night left to stay.  No further compensation was offered. 
We dined in the hotel restaurant and had extremely good service from Amy.  The restaurant, however, had a couple of rather drafty spots and we asked to be moved from the first table allocated to us.
A very disappointing stay.",2,2010,09,30
226,An individual hotel,"A good spot for the weekend in Central Belfast. Slightly quirky modernised hotel -rooms comfortable with a retro-50's feel. Good restaurant and food but not cheap. We were there for a wedding (not in the hotel) and everyone was looked after very well. Service was good throughout with a most helpful concierge. 

If you want somewhere comfortable and slightly different (and not apparently just another chain style hotel) then this is a good bet.",4,2010,09,28
226,Best part of our stay in Belfast,"The Fitzwilliam was a wonderful hotel for us to stay in - we were there for a friend's wedding but we actually felt like we were on holiday ourselves - we were treated so well. The staff are friendly, helpful and bend over backwards to help, the rooms were tastefully decorated, had everything we needed and unusually we slept really well for a city hotel. I saw everything I wanted to in Belfast so don't necessarily need to sightsee more but I would definitely go back to the Fitzwilliam just for a break. Oh and the veggie breakfast was great!",5,2010,09,27
226,Disappointed,Polyester pillows!?! Even the feather one's they provided me with once I complained were hard.  Smallest and most poorly equipped gym I've ever seen in a hotel of this class. Lousy soundproofing on the windows even though the hotel is on one of the busiest streets in Belfast. I hope I can find something better next trip.,3,2010,09,26
226,Second to none,"My 20 year old daughter and I stayed for four nights and were both so impressed by the hotel. Breakfast was fantastic, cooked to order and really good quality and service. Wonderful location for getting around and about, and close to some great places for eating out in the evening. But definately the staff are the greatest asset. The friendly professionalism of every member of staff we encountered made sure we felt sincerely welcome, and I would recommend this hotel as second to none. I hope to return to visit Belfast again and if so I wouldn't dream of staying anywhere else.",5,2010,09,22
226,Sparkling,"The Fitzwilliam hotel was quite simply the best hotel we stayed at in 5 weeks in the Northern Hemisphere!! There is a palpable commitment to excellence on the part of everyone who works there from the porter who raced out enthusiastically to grab our luggage from the cab to the front desk people who were faced with two weary and not very together guests (after a very long international flight). My husband commented that the place must be a nightmare to keep clean as every surface is shiny - which perhaps is the point - everything gleams and there's not a smudge or fingerprint in sight anywhere - this place is clean, clean, clean. The bed was quite simply the most comfortable bed I have ever slept in - a huge king size which cradled weary bodies - so good that I peeled back the bedding to find out who the manufacturer was with a view to maybe getting one for our home. The decor isn't to everyone's taste but it's modern and different and stylish. The location is perfect for tourists to ramble around and despite it's central city location it was incredibly quiet.  I booked this hotel after consulting tripadvisor and through one of the internet hotel booking sites which come with tripadvisor - this hotel was OUTSTANDING value for money -  the cheapest we stayed at on our 5 week vacation and without doubt the best - we had an executive King room for 105 pounds per night! (One hotel we stayed in cost us 295 pounds per night so I'm not comparing the Fitzwilliam with dumps!) Sadly it was only for one night.  I don't know if or when we'll be back in Belfast again but I wouldn't hesitate to stay there again.",5,2010,09,21
226,Superb 5* Hotel.  Beyond are expectations! Highly Recommended,"My mother and I spent one night in the hotel including breakfast.  Every aspect of our stay was superb and couldnt be faulted in any way.  The staff were extremely curtious, the rooms were spotless and the location brilliant.  Unfortunately though, there was a false fire alarm at 11.50pm which did wake both myself and my mother.  It was a little hard getting back to sleep but we were reassured after I phoned reception that all was ok.  I wuld definately recommend this hotel and will hope to stay again in the near future.  We were also located close to the elevator point and I could hear the faint buzzing noise when the elevator doors opened and closed.",5,2010,09,20
226,Fantastic place to stay!!!!!,"This was our first trip to Belfast. The hotel was extremely easy to find. I found it before the GPS did. The location is great, we were able to walk most places. The only down side was the parking. They do have parking available but it was pretty expensive. It was still better then finding a place to park on the street. As soon as we walked in we were pleased with our choice. The staff was very friendly and helpful. When we got to our room we were impressed. It was the nicest place we had ever stayed. The restaurant was awesome. Very modern. The food was very, very good. This will not be our last stay at The Fitzwilliam.",5,2010,09,19
226,Amazing hotel,"What a wonderful hotel. Was in Belfast for a conference but also some R&R afterwards. A great central location. The design of the hotel is breathtaking.  My compliments to the architect and the interior designer. The staff couldn‚Äôt be more helpful. We ate at recommended restaurants with work colleagues for the first 3 nights (including Ginger and the Europa). If only we had known ‚Äì the restaurant at the Fitzwilliam with their menu by Michelin star restaurateur Kevin Thornton was so much better. We had 2 scrumptious dinners there. Bar is also full of character and there is a good library, well-equipped fitness room and free internet access. Beds amazingly comfortable.  The only slight down is that the buffet breakfast is limited and would expect more from a 5 star hotel. Improve that and you have perfection. Certainly the best city centre hotel I have stayed in. And look on their website for special deals - it cost us no more than a 3 star hotel.",5,2010,09,19
226,Excellent,"Joined some of our extended family who were visiting by coach from the US, it was great to meet up with them and this hotel was FAB, really WOW. The check was quick & efficient and the lady at reception asked if we would like to make a dinner reservation and when we told her we were meting some family who were with a coach trip she amde the effort and included us with the group which was great. Breakfast both mornings was great and we really enjoyed the ""Ulster"" take on the Irish Breakfast, we got potato bread & fried soda bread, which we had not experienced before. The room was sporlessly clean and the lounge and public area very well maintained and presented. Sight seeing around Belfast is very easy by public transport, you need to bring ""pounds"" to northern Ireland, they accept Euros but there is an exchange rate, so best to bring Euros with you, also if you travel the M1 motorway from Dublin you will be required to pay a toll by 8pm on th evening after the travel, we were not aware of this and it cost us ‚Ç¨12.00 , because we got a penalty charge. Lovely visit excellent stay . We would like to go back to Belfast some day",5,2010,09,18
226,"Great value, location and service.","The staff of the Fitzwilliam couldn't do enough for us.  We loved the decor and the location.  Don't miss the Grand Opera House next door!  We only ate in the bar, but the food was fine!",5,2010,09,16
226,Super Place to stay in Belfast,"My wife and I went to the Fitzwilliam last weekend for a joint birthday treat. This was the first time staying there but we both very much enjoyed our stay and would definitely return. We stayed in a suite which was very nice with lovely views over Belfast city and the Black mountains, it really had the feel of an international 5 star hotel. The location is great with easy access to the shopping areas, restaurants and bars, all literally withing a five minute walk. We both look forward to going again. Enjoy!!!",4,2010,09,15
226,Great place to stay,"This is good hotel, rooms are good, staff friendly, breakfast great. They allowed us to check in early, which is appreciated after long flight. Location is very good. Cant fault the place.",5,2010,09,15
226,Disappointed expected more from 5star Hotel,"Great location. Very disappointed in size of twin room when requested change had to pay ¬£30 per night. Original room when beds seperated the bedside light was resting on the pillow. Dont know how they expected anyone to sleep under these conditions.  Had to adjust the position of beds and lights in second room also. Disappointed also in dining experience. Dinner fairly basic, expected much more. Asked for cream for strawberries at breakfast and got something out of a spray can. Could have been much better.",3,2010,09,14
226,total disrespect for customers,"when hotel first opened we stayed for weekend it was just perfect so when I returned home I got a Fitzwilliam card  through my business because I planed using the hotel on a regular bases which I did over the next year but each time I stayed the hotel had gone from bad to worse one time I was given the wrong room another stay my car was left outside on the footpath when I had paid for secure parking.we booked for my daughter and grandson to stay with us on one occasion and went down to breakfast to join them  the next morning and found them in a corner at back of restaurant away from everyone else when the restaurant was empty, if hotel does not want young children to stay it should not take the booking.   on our last stay we had a meal booked for Saturday at eight but when we got down we were told that they had double booked and the only time they could fit us in was nine thirty, this was to late so we booked for the next night at eight  and had to go outside hotel for meal.   when we went for the meal the next evening  my wife found the soup tasted sour  so she ask me to taste it , it tasted like vinegar, I called over a member of staff who took it away and returned  five Min later and told me that the chef had made one fresh bowl there and then as they had ran out of the soup ordered, but i found it hard to believe as not only was soup really sour but it was also cold, if soup had just been made would it not have been hot as it has to boil firstly  for ingredients to blend.  we ask to speak to restaurant  manager, when he came I found him rude  and arrogant (alex is restaurant manager) and we were told that if we did not like it we could leave.  we told him that we had already cancelled the meal as i dont like being lied to i would prefer it if someone came out and said sorry a mistake has been made.    checking out I asked for hotel managers name and number as he was not available and left mine and  a message for him to contact me when after a few days we had not heard from him i phoned again and  this time I got a phone call back not from manager he was to busy but from head chef, he again told me the same story that the soup was made fresh, I work in the food trade and find it an insult to my intelligence that they think i dont know when soup is sour.  we telephoned at least 5 more times and manager would never come to phone. I will never be back in this hotel, when management cannot be bothered to speak to customers with a genuine complaint and staff seem to  think they are better than the paying customer,  if I treated my customers this way I would not have any,  if you are looking a good hotel to stay in try Hilton Belfast good location lovely food and great staff.",1,2010,09,12
226,Excellent choice,"I really enjoyed staying at this modern and well appointed hotel.  The staff were friendly, the room comfortable and I would have no hesitation in recommending it to fellow travellers.",4,2010,09,10
226,Excellent value for money,"Good location and very good value for money.  Possibly the best combination of hotel quality and cost I have encountered anywhere in the world.  Comfortable, well-appointed room.  Exceptional service and friendly staff.  Will definitely stay here again when in Belfast.",5,2010,09,07
226,Lovely hotel in a great location,"I booked this hotel through booking.com as we came over for my friend's wedding, it's was the same price as the Jurys Inn across the road! . It was recommended by her and her mates as THE place to be ;o) We stayed for two nights and I would definitely go back. The reception is very modern but gorgeous and all the staff wear a lime green scarf or tie which looks very posh! Our suitcase was taken straightaway while we checked in. Lovely chap called James showed us to our room on the 5th floor which was handy as a lot of stuff is hidden and we'd never have found it! The room is spacious with a nice big and comfy bed, comfy sofa, desk, minibar, music playyer, tellie, huge bathroom with walk in shower and bath. There are bathrobes, slippers, shoe polish and a brollie which was so handy!
The view from our room wasn't great but since we didn't spend much time there in the day it was fne. The drapes were nice and heavy and blocked out all the light so when you wake up it could be noon and you were none the wiser it's so dark in the room. Very pleasantly surprised by the noise levels in the hotel, i.e. you can't hear the neighbours thorugh the walls and you can't hear people walk past at night or in the morning. We had the room turned down while were out both nights which was a nice touch and when we called accommodation for more milk it was delivered straightaway and they weren't mean with the quantities.
The location is great, 5 mins walk from all the shops, the tour buses leave right across the road and the grand opera is right next door. There is fitness suite which we never tried out though, a restaurant and a bar downstairs. The bar food was really nice and well presented but quite pricey. Cocktails were pricey too but lush! 
All in all a fab hotel with staff that can't do enough for  you. There's a library too for those avid readers. We'd go back ina flash if I found a good offer and will recommend this hotel to anyone looking for an elegant quiet stay. Oh and there's free wifi too ;oo)",5,2010,09,06
226,"A very enjoyable overnight stay in the Fitzwilliam Hotel, Belfast","My wife and I and friends stayed in the Fitzwilliam Hotel for a very enjoyable one night stay. A very nice hotel within walking distance for resturants and bars, very clean and modern with friendly staff. I was booked into a disabled room which had plently of room to get around in a wheel chair, good sized shower only one fault, it did not have anywere to set your shampoo and shower gel. Breakfast was very good I would stay in this hotel again and would recommend it for wheel chair users.",5,2010,08,31

The hotel itself is perfect, the staff are so courteous and polite, the rooms are very spacious, the bathrooms are huge, showers are really powerful.  The breakfast is stunning, really amazing food.  The only thing I didn't like is the dark corridors on the floors, they really could do with turning the lights up a bit.",5,2010,08,29
226,Excellent stay at the Fitzwilliam,"We have been to Belfast many times and this was our first stay at the Fitzwilliam, previously staying at the Jury's (good) and Travelodge (disgusting), the fitzwilliam was excellent in every way, staff very helpful and polite, rooms very comfortable, very good breakfast and location. We are frequent travellers and this hotel is second best on our list.",5,2010,08,28
226,couldn't be a better hotel in Belfast!,"My husband and I stayed for two nights at the Fitzwilliam and enjoyed it so much we have vowed to go back! The location was perfect, the staff wonderful, the rooms spacious and quiet and the food EXCEPTIONAL.In these times it is so common to find the breakfast ""experience"" quite indifferent, not so here - the staff in the dining room went that extra mile to make it a good start to the day. It is certainly worthy of its five star status, and we would not hesitate to recommend it to anyone! There is so much to see and do in the capital that it is an ideal base to travel from and return to, for the level of consideration from all the staff left us feeling so relaxed that we didn't want to leave,.....  still all good things must come to an end but there is always tomoroow!",5,2010,08,27
226,simply perfect,"we stayed 2 nights at Fitzwilliams and everything was perfect. 
the room was big, with every confort and very silent. 
the breakfast was incredible, with every kind of things one can desire.
the concierge was really nice and helpful and all the staff the same.

just a perfect stay",5,2010,08,26
226,Did you say 5star?,"Went to Belsonic and decided to stay in the Fitzwilliam. We looked at cheaper places but decided to spoil ourselves and go 5 star. The reception was nice but quite a cold appearance despite the fire lighting.  Got to our room on the 7th floor and when we stepped out of the life we thought we were in the basement!  The corridors are decorated in black and are so dimly lit it was actually difficult to read the door numbers. We booked a twin room which was very small and the two beds were jammed together so we may as well have booked a double. But the bathroom was lovely with seperate shower and bath, although the water poured out the bottom of the shower door onto the floor. Despite it being a twin room, hence two people, there was only one bottle of water, one lot of toiletries and one facecloth.  The pillowcase on one of the beds was threadbare.
The one bit we were really looking forward to was our dinner that evening.  But the excitement was short-lived.  First impressions were good but once we were seated in our booth the ledge behind was so dirty there were balls of dust sitting on it.  Water was poured but i had to change mine because there was a floater in it and the food was disappointing.  Starters were ok but the lamb wasnt good. It looked more like boiled ham and one slice was pure fat which left three very small pieces. When the plate was taken away there was a big black ring left on the tablecloth. The dessert of chocolate mousse cake was obviously frozen and defrosted because it crumbled in slivers when the fork went in rather than lovely velvety moussey texture we'd expected. Sorry but I've stayed in nicer 3star hotels. Very disappointing.",3,2010,08,21
226,"excellent ,excellent ,excellent","Everything was excellent from stepping out from our taxi in the rain ,door porter came to escort us in with an umberella until we checked out ,will definately return .
A big thank you to all the wonderful staff who were extremly helpful and courteuos  not one would pass you without speaking to you ,morning, noon or night .
The hotel website shows you exact photos unlike some other hotels ,rooms were big, bright and very comfortable we had booked bed and breakfast the breakfast was also excellent with loads of staff on looking after everyone .
This hotel is very central only a couple of streets away and you are in the city centre , very well run so thank you  to the hotel management as well keep it up .",5,2010,08,21
226,Enjoyable Stay,"Stayed here for one night whilst attending a concert locally. Both my partner and I really enjoyed our one night stay and loved the plush rooms. We had an executive room and the facilities were faultless- in-room CD player, LCD, tea/coffee facilities, dressing gowns, iron and hair dryer. The beds were really comfortable and the room was immaculate.

Honestly can't see why people would complain about the hotel. Excellent location and excellent hotel for special occassions.",5,2010,08,20
226,Lovely hotel in a great location,"We arrived on a wet day to a very welcoming lobby with open gas fire.
Our room was on the 7th floor with beautiful views of the mountains, and had everything we needed to make our stay really comfortable.
We ate in the bar on our first night and had several drinks there, and thorougly enjoyed it.
We had breakfast each morning, which was a refreshing change from the buffets which are so popular nowadays.
The hotel is quite luxurious and most of the staff are wonderful, I would definitly stay there again(but not at the full 5 star prices).",5,2010,08,19
226,"5* hotel, in perfect location","Fantastic hotel with very helpful staff.  It also has a nice restaurant and bar, no buffet breakfasts here - all cooked to order.  Rooms were very clean and the bathroom was spotless. Key location and near to the local train station and bus station.",5,2010,08,19
226,"The most friendly and helpfull staff-great location,beautiful large rooms. A must..","The best experience of all hotels we have stayed with, the staff were so friendly,could not do enough for you in terms of directions, what sight seeing would be the best, as well as knowing the history of their city. The room was large and had all the things you want when you are away. Cant wait to re-visit... Will try their sister hotel in Dublin after our experience in Belfast. A must when in belfast....",5,2010,08,16
226,Not quite five star but good all the same,"I agree with previous reviewers. This hotel isn't quite a five star. But we were paying ¬£80 for a double and I thought it was good value at that price. The front desk were very helpful. The room was well-furnished and had quite a 'cool' feel to it. I loved the walk-in shower in the bathroom although it did seem to leak water into the main bathroom even though the shower door was shut. The bed was very comfortable and I slept well.
Biggest downside? The prices for breakfast were ridiculously high. I think the management of this hotel need to accept that they have built a nice four star hotel and charge appropriately for all services.",4,2010,08,15
226,Not 5* (and actually the hotel has still not had an official grade awarded!),"Having read the reviews below I was looking forward to spending some time in the Fitzwilliam with my husband at the end of a trip to NI to mark our 1st wedding anniversary.  Well, I am not sure where previous guests have stayed before to enable them to compare but there is no way this is a 5* hotel.  Perhaps I am spoiled living in Edinburgh and being surrounded by quality luxury hotels but I think the staff should take a trip to The Balmoral, Tigerlily etc to see how its done!
Firstly, check-in was inoffensive, practical, polite, job done.  However no-one even suggested helping us with our luggage.  Lobby area was beautiful.

Got to our room, 606, corridors are so dimly lit it was actually difficult to read the door numbers.  Room was decorated in a very contemporary manner and it is starting to date already, tatty seams on the sofa, bed-linen very creased.  And then my husband decided to have a wee drink from the mini-bar . . . . . It was filthy, was not working and the spillage of what was either cream or milk was smelly and dried in.  There were other remnants of the previous guests picnic and nothing else.  (I am beginning to have a complex about mini-bars as we had a similar problem at Turnberry!)  We were heading into town for the afternoon and mentioned it at reception on our way out.

Fast-forward about 4 hours and we returned to our room and naturally the first thing we checked was the mini-bar.  It was spotless, but empty!!  We rang reception and Charlene, who was very helpful, suggested moving rooms as the minbar was broken.  A couple of minutes later we were taken to room 604.  Same style room, but the upholstery and bedding were not as tatty.  However the same could not be said of the furniture.  The problem with having such dark wood effects is that every scratch is very obvious and requires a lot of upkeep.  The bathroom door frame had a big knock out of it, the dressing table and chips all along the edge and one of the bedside tables had all the lacquer peeling off, it looked like this damage was due to spilt liquid.

The problem with the hotel is that it seems to be all for appearances but has little to offer in terms of substance or attention to detail.  
For example, the first room had fresh flowers, none in the second room.  
The staff had four hours to sort the minibar issue but we had to follow it up ourselves.
At breakfast the next morning, the ledge behind my booth seat was so dirty that my white T-shirt had marks on it when I placed my arm there.
Also, at breakfast, a waiter called Raj was standing chewing gum with his mouth open which I did not want to see!

One other question was how can they justify some prices on the room service menu being more expensive than the Al A Carte for the same dish?  Such were the inconsistancies were that other dishes were cheaper.

There were some great aspects to the hotel, the lobby, the choice of pillows, Charlene on reception, the location, the design of the bar and restaurant, the monochrome bathroom, the toiletries, the mood lightening in the bathroom which was great if you had to get up during the night!, and all the mirrors.

One interesting point was that as I was checking out and explaining my disappointment at what I did not feel was a five star experience, I was told by a member of reception staff that the hotel does not actually have a 5* grading as it is still undergoing the process to be graded.  I think it is wrong then that it is being marketed as 5* when this is not official.  I personally would grade the hotel as 4* but even then I can name others that would beat it hands down.",3,2010,08,10
226,Not what you would expect from the FITZWILLIAM,"The hotel is beautiful it really lives up to the hype on the interior design and lush surroundings. But oh no it down hill from here as the facility to park is poor and not explained fully at time of booking, I have to say I got over that as I did not want to get  upset over parking my car.  We made reservations to have our evening meal for 6pm the restaurant was beautiful the food was wonderful I must say it has been one of the best meals I have ever had.  The service was first class but I am still in shock that a hotel with the 5 star rating like the Fitzwilliam had no ""Rose Wine"" in any part of the hotel, this is hard to believe but it's TRUE!!  I would also like to let you know the Bar Staff are not the best you'll ever be served by, the male working the bar had no people skills and only know how to upset guests rather than please the customer and make them feel welcome, so we left the bar and went across to Robinson's were we enjoyed a few drinks and were served with a smile without the coldness of the barman across in this hotel.   I must also say he was so immature he even spoke about other guests in a rude manner this was hard to listen too.  The front desk staff were wonderful & the dinning room staff. I don't want to put anyone of staying here but I have had better stays elsewhere so please don't expect too much and you wont be disappointed!!!",3,2010,08,10
226,Definately not 5 Star,"Stayed in the Fitzwilliam last weekend on a girl‚Äôs night out - we were going to book somewhere cheap and cheerful but decided in the end to push the boat out and go 5 star - we're worth it! The first thing we were disappointed with was the frontage to the hotel there was no where to park apart from at the side of the hotel and then get someone to valet park it which also cost ¬£17 for one night,  which we thought was a bit much since we were residents. The reception area while I know is meant to be modern contemporary lacked any kind of plushness that you would expect from a 5 star. We were then shown to our rooms which were tiny - they were twin rooms (which are not shown on the website and were very very small) the 2 beds were pushed together so we may as well have booked a double. If you didnt know the person you were sharing with pretty well you would by the end of the night! The decor was nice and the bathroom was lovely however the shower pressure was terrible and it was leaking in the other room that we booked. The breakfast the next day was a bit like Kevin Thornton himself a bit bland and lacking in niceness. Very disappointed and would not recommend if your looking for luxury, the best thing is the location which is very central. If we were going again think we'd just go to Jurys Inn which is right across the road. Maybe were not worth it after all.",3,2010,08,10
226,"Beautiful hotel, excellent location","I stayed for one night in this city centre hotel.  Found the staff friendly and helpful,  Hotel was clean and beautifully decorated- modern. Convenient to bus and train station, shopping a short walk,  great restaurants and bars on doorstep and next door to theatre you couldn't find a better location to explore Belfast.",5,2010,08,09
226,"Terrific hotel, terrific staff, couldn't recommend highly enough","Stayed for one night with my husband. We had such an enjoyable time. The staff are just terrific, so efficient. From the second we arrived - the concierge was just so good at his job and was a real pleasure to deal with. Nothing was too much trouble. The rooms were class, talk about spacious & conmfortable - with everything you need. I love the mirrors on the doors. The decor is very modern - I really liked it. 
We had an evening meal here as well. The service was good. I wasn't overly keen on my main course - Tagliatelle. I thought it was a little bland, but overall the entire meal was terrific. One other thing I would say is charging for the bread is a bit much. I think the hotel should reconsider this. I haven't seen this charge before. 
Meal was very relaxing and again the staff terrific. 
We ate again for our lunch the following day. The minute steak was just fantastic. Again just one thing - you pay for the sides which I have no problem with as such, I just think it would be better to include the price for the sides in the entire price. 
The business centre is an excellent resource and just that - a business centre. Very, very comfortable settings. The foyer area is very comfortable and luxurious. 
The hotel location is  excellent. The restaurant is so modern and the decor again is class. Probably one of the best places I have stayed in. Will be back & would definitely recommend.",5,2010,08,09

The bedrooms are gorgeous, really modern yet cosy and comfortable. The beds were hugh and soooo comfortable. The bathrooms were beautiful too and everything was spotlessly clean.

Check in was smooth and pleasant receptionist gave us our card to room 518.
Room was ultra-modern with all mod cons.Comfortable enough sleep on super-king size bed.
Breakfast was great with so many different options to order.
Bar is so cool and had the best selection of drinks I have seen in a hotel bar.

Only 2 negatives to report which were the air conditioning in the rooms is very weak and the rooms do get very very warm(we asked for a fan and they duly obliged) and the tv only has basic channels and would have expected a 5* hotel to have at least freeview.
This would definitely not put us off staying her again.",4,2010,07,28

226,"Great location, great hotel","My wife was in Belfast on business, and I tagged along for fun. The Fitzwilliam was a great hotel for both of our needs. The room had a modern feel, and was bright and new. My ipod easily hooked up to the the mini stereo system. If you are touring Belfast, I can't think of a better location: shopping, restaurants, and sights were all easily walkable. 

I only have one small gripes: the LCD TVs need to be wall mounted on swivel mounts instead of stuck on a small shelf that limits movement.",5,2010,07,27
226,Modern boutique hotel in fantastic location!,"We stayed for one night at the Fitzwilliam hotel in Belfast, after getting a good rate on Hotels.com for B&B and seeing the superb reviews on here for the hotel.  The hotel is very centrally located, just round the corner from the bus station (there is an excellent bus service between Belfast City Airport and the city center, ¬£3 return per person.)  The concierge couldn't have been more helpful, booking us a black taxi tour and giving us ideas of where to shop, eat and drink!  The room on the fifth floor, was very spacious, a big double bed, a sofa, cd player, bathrobes&slippers and a big bathroom with bath and a large walk in shower.  There was even a turn down service which was a nice touch!  We had a couple of drinks in the bar - a little expensive but convenient and a good atmosphere!  Breakfast was served until 11.30am on Sunday morning which was ideal but the service was a little chaotic, the buffet elements were picked over, our initial tea&toast order were lost and the cooked breakfast took more than 20 minutes to come.  I realise they were busy but the service in the rest of the hotel was spot on and this just let them down slightly.  Check out was quick and efficient, they are obviously well organised for a busy 12noon check out on a Sunday morning!  If you are planning a weekend in Belfast then I would definitely recommend this hotel for it's location, style and the helpfulness of the team!",4,2010,07,27
226,"Book,stay you wont regret it!","Brilliant, Brilliant, Brilliant, staff/room/restaurant all excellent.  Room very modern design all you need and more, loved the colours-black,mustard,grey and great use of full length mirrors on the front door of your room and a peephole too! Staff in the restaurant go above and beyond to advise you and so friendly and proffessional too.  The menu is great, we had bread, oils, olives to start and beef so soft it melted in your mouth.  Next morning the marmalade was to die for and the reason - all the food is made in the Hotel kitchen.  Our stay was made so good by the staff.

As the Hotel is in the city centre everything is so handy, train station. Opera House, City Hall all within walking distance, virtually next door.  The city has a lot to offer as does this Hotel.  I would give it 10/10. TRY IT",5,2010,07,26
226,It is a treat to stay at a hotel that you enjoy coming 'home' to when you are away from home.,"From the lobby to our room, the Fitzwilliams' decor was very chic.  From the lobby to our room the  Fitzwilliams' staff was wonderful - friendly, helpful and went over and above when needed.  The restaurant was phenomenal for breakfast and dinner - we throughly enjoyed our stay.  It was a great location for business meetings as well as wandering the sights of the city.  We were well taken care of, especially by Patrick (conciege stand/lobby).",5,2010,07,26
226,"standard of hotel was top class and staff were excellent, they helped make our stay perfect","I would highly recommend this hotel to anyone, it location is perfect and the rooms very modern and exceptionally clean and fresh.  Foods was superb and nothing was too much trouble for the staff - expecially the porters",5,2010,07,24
226,Amazing hotel...will definately stay here again,I stayed here for one night and it was a truely amazing experience.This hotel simply goes that extra mile.After checking in a concierge showed us to our room 512 and explained how everything worked.The rooms are beautifully decorated very boutique and very clean.Instead of just sachets of coffee they give you a cafetiere with fresh coffee.A fresh orchid was also in the room and many little nightlight candles.In the bathroom was a bath and a double shower and you are given slippers and the use of bathrobes.We did have a drink in the bar again beautifully decorated.I would recommend this hotel and will definately be staying here again.I have stayed in many hotels in Belfast and imo Fitzwilliam is the best,5,2010,07,24
226,Great location and staff but dodgy decor.,"The hotel itself is in probably the best location you could get in central Belfast close to bars, theatre and the bus station. The lobby/reception looks like it should work but somehow it doesn‚Äôt. It‚Äôs the same with the bar behind the reception, it‚Äôs far too dark and the orange furniture is horrible and uncomfortable. Check in was a breeze and this is where this place makes up for its faults, the staff are helpful and polite yet professional.  The receptionist asked if I wanted a newspaper each morning (Didn‚Äôt arrive the second morning) whether I needed an alarm call or a booking for a table for dinner. All excellent from front of house. My room had a great view over the mountains. The room is of average size for a 5* hotel. The furniture and fittings, while contemporary will date very quickly and were not to my taste at all‚Ä¶.. A bit too Las Vegas for me. The bed was huge and comfortable.  The bathroom had a bath and shower and was contemporary but was very badly lit. I would say this hotel is a good 4* but certainly not a 5* hotel. For what I paid I received good value for money. Would I return, probably not.",3,2010,07,23
226,ABSOLUTELY FANTASTIC,"Bit late with this review as we stayed here at Christmas 2009. Booked this hotel for my husband and I as we do every christmas to do a bit of last minute shopping in town , have a nice meal and a bit of ""us"" Time away from the family. So handy for shopping and restaurant in bBelfast. On check in noticed the lovely white sofas in Reception/Foyer area and the roaring open fire, very welcoming. Our room was lovely very ""minimalist"" with dark wood and lovely green accents, complete with robes and slippers....lol.. We did not eat in the restaurant but had a few cocktails in the bar  and had breakfast in the hotel the next morning which was fantastic..........Cooked breakfast to order ......The room service was so so quick in fact the concierge could not do enough to help you every time we came down in the lift they were enquiring to see if there was anything we wanted ...taxis , reservations etc...
Loved the Fitzwilliam....even though we live in Belfast...cant wait to go back.",5,2010,07,22
226,"Excellent hotel, would definately recommend","This is an excellent hotel located very well in the center of Belfast. Its close to the main shopping area and to a number of good bars and restuarants.
The hotel itself is very modern, the rooms are big with a large comfortable bed and very good bathroom. Got this hotel for a great price online with breakfast included. Breakfast was good but I would have thought it was overpriced had I paid for it seperately. Has a very nice bar and restaurant. 
Thought the selection of TV stations in the room was very poor but I was only there for one night so it wasn't a problem.
This hotel is very similar to its sister hotel in Dublin but the room I had here was bigger so for that reason alone I would rate it slightly higher.
You wont be sorry if you stay here, highly recommended.",5,2010,07,22
226,Perfect!!!,"I would definately recommed this hotel to anyone. The staff is very helpful and welcoming. The breakfast was really good. The rooms were amazing. Really big for a hotel in Europe/ UK. I loved the decoration and the bed. The location of the hotel is perfect, right in the middle of the city center. Few minute walking distance from the restaurants and sights to see. It was not very expensive either compared to all the other hotels in Belfast. I would definately stay in Fitzwillam again. Its a five star!!!!!!!!",5,2010,07,21
226,Another Belfast break!,"excellent hotel and good value for money if you book through any web site except the hotel. Telephoning for a price was easy "" we will not price match any body"" but all other travel company's offered a better price.
Yes we will consider the Fitzwilliam again but this was just one of a number of hotels we priced and went there on recomendations",4,2010,07,20
226,AMAZING!,"This is the best hotel I've ever stayed. The room is great, very large with any possible comfort; the staff were really friendly and they help me in every way, the location is perfect, in 5 minutes you can reach the City hall and the bus station... Beautiful, fantastic and amazing!!! I recommend the Fitzwilliam, if You want to live Belfast! Thank you!",5,2010,07,20
226,wow comfortable and cosmopolitan loved it,"i was so pleased with my stay here,the rooms were a lovely size,the bathroom was lovely and the bed was so comfortable,i loved the decor of the hotel itself and throughly enjoyed a drink in the bar which i found to be very cosmopolitan.
Belfast needed a hotel like this and I will most definately be staying here again soon, thank you for such an enjoyable stay.",5,2010,07,19
226,Excellent hotel for very good value and location,"Located just next to the city centre, this hotel has almost everything you need. We stayed there for two nights. The rooms are very fancy, clean, quite large and the bed is very comfortable. The stuff even prepared our room for nighttime by closing the curtains or prepare the bed for sleep. The only things to mention that are not excellent are the price for a full Irish breakfast which is around 19¬£ and the parking that costs 17¬£ a day. But there are some nearby parkings for 10¬£ a day. We definitely would stay there again!",5,2010,07,18
226,cool,from the second the taxi arrived in the rain . the porter welcomed us with a smile and a umbrella . the feeling on entering the hotel reception area was a pleasent surprise we felt right at home very relaxed such a very happy hotel . we were taken to our room . a large open double with all the trims a very tasteful room . we had a fantastic stay with the friendliest staff i have ever had the pleasure of being looked after . you will have a great stay 100% recomended,5,2010,07,17
226,Not as flash as they think they are,"This hotel has some good points, being centrally located with rooms identical to those advertised and a beautiful lobby equipped with a fire place and small library.
However, it is extremely over priced for the services it provides. Parking is 17 pound a day and offered as ""the best option"" when the car park across the road charges 5 pound/night. 
Breakfast, if not included in the room rate is absurdly expensive and consists only of a meagre cereal buffet while all hot food must be ordered of which portions are miniscule. Even toast is served - unappetisingly cold and burnt.
Room was pleasant although nothing spectacular - no hot chocolate or biscuits but a coffee plunger was provided. Air conditioning didn't work.
Exercise facilities are very limited for a 5 star hotel.",3,2010,07,15
226,If you want the best then book in to this hotel,Could walk to every were have stayed in lots of city hotels and this has to be one of the best i left feeling i had made a fab choice this says it all,5,2010,07,15
226,best located hotel in the city and even better service,"we had an unexpected holiday that left us with the choice of staying in ireland so we decided on belfast. lots of hotels to choose from but after staying in the Fitzwilliam in Dublin only 6months previous to this time we thought we would give it a try. we stayed monday to friday. alot cheaper than its Dublin counterpart and just as fancy. we arrived early as we got the train from Dublin. hotel is just 100m or so from Great Victoria Station. very handy and situated right beside the Grand Opera House, as we were going to a show, it couldnt have been better located. They took our bags and showed use to the bar while they speeded up the room  for us. which was only 30 mins wait... nice trendy bar so we were in no rush to move. 2 drinks later we made for the room. Very Nice! nicely designed... Black, White and Lime Green (sounds weird but expected from Such a Hotel as the Fitzwilliam) big soft beds, nice size bath (not really for 2, we soon found out) shower amazing, lovely bath robes and slippers(still have a pair) everything you expect from a high level hotel. would definatly recommend this place to stay for business or pleasure. its right beside Deanes restaurant and has a thorntons part of the hotel but no where near its big brother restaurant in Dublin. love this place and will stay again when go back to belfast",5,2010,07,15
226,One of the best hotels... ever,"Couldn't fault this hotel - location, cost, service, comfort - all outstanding and definitely recommended.",5,2010,07,14
226,A wonderful hotel,"The whole atmosphere of this hotel is quiet efficiency, making the stay a very relaxing experience. Room was wonderful, staff absolutely great. Food excellent. Location central, near shops, opera house and access to tours etc. A very enjoyable 4 night stay. Staff organised hire cars, parking, eating, etc without any hassle. All very friendly.",5,2010,07,14
226,Can I stay longer......,"We arrived at 9.30am, on arriving at reception I asked if they could store our bags as aware that checkin was not until 2pm.  The lovely receptionist kindly let us checkin early....bonus for us as we got to go and explore this wonderful city !
Rooms are fantastic, love the walk in shower (tempted to get one for my home !)- unfortunately as only there for one night did not get to use the fabulous bath !
Did not eat in the hotel but was in the residents bar after our night out, very friendly staff.  Decor of the hotel is amazing - just love it and want to go back again soon !",5,2010,07,13
226,"Great on the Cosmos, less good on the fruit salads","I agree with most of the other positive comments about service, location and style. 

I had the best Cosmopolitan I have ever had (and I've had a few), expertly mixed by the young barman from Enniskillen (didn't get his name) who even showed me his secret trick with the orange peel and the cigarette lighter.

Staff took their jobs seriously and we appreciated their professionalism.

The buffet table at breakfast was a bit nursery-like with its array of cereals and milky products and I felt that the fruit salad focused too much on apples and lacked any real interest either in taste or in presentation. The cooked breakfast was fine.",5,2010,07,10
226,Good.....but!,"Deluxe rooms were fantastic, one of the comfiest beds i have ever slept in.
the staff were very pleasant apart from below,

The service and food at breakfast was a massive let down for this hotel.
the young team of girls were unorganised, we were asked four times what we would like to order and again for tea & coffee four times. not one of them had a smile or seemed to care. one of our colleauges sat down at 7.05, his order taken at 7.15, the food came 25 minutes later, we had to ask where it was. there were less than ten in the restaurant whilst we were there.
the bacon was hard, the poached eggs were hard, and the serving was very small.
the restaurant staff did not seem bothered at all.
We are opening a new business in Belfast and will need accommodation quite a lot, the breakfast has tarnished what was turning out to be a successful choice.",5,2010,07,09
226,"Excellent service & location, fantastic hotel, just fix the air conditioning","Great design and wonderful staff. Our only disappointment was that the rooms were too hot. We were moved once to see if another room had better air conditioning but still had troubles. When we did have concerns of any sort, the staff responded with friendly and efficient solutions that always favoured customer satisfaction - the staff obviously have been well trained and been given permission to say 'yes'.",4,2010,07,08
226,Brilliant Hotel in a Brilliant Location.,Fab hotel.  Very modern lobby.  We stayed on the sixth floor in an executive room .. The lime and green colour  and the lighting is so relaxing.  From the minute we arrived at the hotel we received top class service.. Conceirge and front desk were brilliant.  We enjoyed a beautiful meal in the restaurant on Saturday night and then went on to the bar for a few drinks.  The top class service just continued.. We were served by Kalam who was brilliant.  The choice for breakfast was lovely.  The only problem was the we only stayed 1 night but we will def stay again and highly recommend The Fitzwilliam to anyone who wants to stay in Belfast.,5,2010,07,06
226,This place knows how to treat a customer,"I have stayed in a number of hotels over the years and this is definitely one of my top hotels.  Not only are the rooms very stylish and exceptionally clean but the hospitality is second to none.  You would think the hotel was actually owned by the staff, they invest so much in your comfort and enjoyment but maintain a distance so you are not smothered with it. I love that they have robes as so many hotels have dispensed with this and it always takes away from your stay particularly if you have been looking forward to some time away.  Wifi, CD player and umbrella in the room gives the clear impression that someone has thought about what you need for your weekend.  It does rain alot in Belfast!
The breakfast is a real treat and it is again refreshing to have an ordered breakfast than the buffet style which never tastes as good as it looks.
The concierge team are exceptional and nothing is too much trouble.  They take you to your room and carry your luggage and show you around your room which makes you feel you are staying with your rich friend!
The lounge is lovely with the fire feature which is very relaxing.
Without a doubt these people have customer service nailed to the floor.  Outstanding.",5,2010,07,06
226,I regularly stay in hotels so when I mean this was good - it really was better than most,"Clean, organised, friendly and everything felt genuine.  I have already recommended this hotel to a friend.",5,2010,07,05
226,Perfect hotel choice,"We stayed here our first two nights in a 10-day trip in Ireland, and it ended up being the best hotel of all our nights.  It's a stylish boutique hotel in a great location and with good service.  The room was a good size, very clean, quiet, nicely designed, and had many nice small touches.  The staff helped arrange a black cab tour for us, and the guide was outstanding.  It was also nice that the hotel had a business center to check email back home; we didn't know this would be a rarity in the hotels in Ireland.  I would definitely recommend this hotel and would also point out that there is a sister FitzWilliam in Dublin, which we were disappointed to have not chosen (stayed at The Clarence, which I would not recommend).",5,2010,07,05
226,The most beautiful hotel we have ever stayed in,Myself and my husband stayed here for 1 night on 2nd July to celebrate our 1st wedding anniversary. We thoroughly enjoyed our stay. The room was beautifully decorated and the staff were the most courteous we have ever encountered. We enjoyed a few cocktails in the hotel bar and were surprised when the bar staff offered us a complimentary champagne cocktail to celebrate our 1st year of marriage. We would like to especially thank the bar staff for making our stay so enjoyable. All in all a most enjoyable stay and we would recommend the hotel to everyone.,5,2010,07,05
226,exceeded my expectations!,"Very impressed nice hotel, helpful staff and a nice comfortable bar.",4,2010,07,05
226,"A perfect stay, one of the best hotels I've visited","This hotel is breathtaking as you enter the lobby. The decor is consistently stylish and stunning throughout the public areas and rooms. 
Service was wonderful, very friendly and helpful staff at the front desk, restaurant and cocktail bar (one particularly lovely waiter in the bar went out of his way to give us great service, wish I had asked for his name) We LOVED the cocktails, not too expensive considering how good they were.
Location is fantastic right in the centre of Belfast, four of us travelled from Scotland for the Snow Patrol concert in June and stayed here for two nights. As it turned out Snow Patrol were staying in the hotel too and we even got to meet them!
The room was wonderful, with beautiful details and very clean. Turn down service was a nice touch which you don't find in enough hotels these days.
We also dined in the restaurant and the food was magnificent, prices surprisingly low for the quality and the surroundings lovely.
Overall, I was blown away by this hotel and have already booked a stay in October as a surprise for my boyfriend's birthday. He works in the hospitality industry and has very high standards but I know he will love the Fitzwilliam Hotel as much as I did and can't wait to surprise him. You will not find a better hotel in Belfast for the money.",5,2010,07,04
226,"Amazing service, brilliant food, lovely staff and great location!","If you go to Belfast, stay here! I took a business trip but spun it out into a leisure trip by taking the family and staying on. The hotel provided a brilliant trained nanny for an additional fee, who knew all the best places for children. The hotel restaurant has a pre-theatre menu which is perfectly timed for an early dinner with children. 

From an adults perspective, the restaurant is one of the best I've visited - the service was discreet and attentive and the wine list offered a good variety over a wide price range. 

The room was spacious, the bed enormous and very comfortable with spare pillows in zipped bags in the cupboard. The bathroom, which had a shower and a separate bath, had some nice touches like candles on the side of the bath, and most importantly, matches to light them!

The service was flawless, the staff friendly and nothing was an inconvenience. Stay here!",5,2010,07,04
226,Great introduction to Northern Ireland,"This hotel has nice stylish rooms (cool bathroom!) and a good central location.  We only stayed one night, our first in Ireland, and arrived kind of jetlagged.  The staff were really helpful and in view of our short stay (we were driving out next morning) organized a Black Taxi tour virtually straight away, which was an excellent introduction to Belfast.  There is secure valet parking behind the hotel.",4,2010,07,03
226,food very bad chef should go to bricklaying,i went to this hotel for a meal with my family for a special occasion the starter came out and i never ever got somthing so bad we were going to leave then but stayed thinking maybe the main meal would be better but it was so bad we couldnt even eat it for all the little ther was. i wouldnt recomend anyone to eat at this hotel the chef should be imbarrised at the food he is cooking my children could do better.      john,2,2010,07,01
226,Fabulous hotel,The Fitzwilliam was a fabulous place for our visit. Conveniently located to the downtown area. A very clean and modern looking hotel. Top notch concierge desk was very helpful in arranging a 'black taxi' tour. Made my Belfast visit a great one and would stay there if I should visit the city again.,5,2010,06,29
226,Totally modern chic,"Was so excited when I opened the door to our room  - it was absolute luxury.  The decor was very chic and the bathroom was definitely a highlight - huge shower and huge bath.  The staff were great, freiendly and extremely efficient even down to the two doormen in the evening.

Drinks are a bit pricey at the bar we paid ¬£24 for 2 cocktails but it was a treat so we didnt get too many. 

Have recently stayed in another 5* Hotel in Belfast and after our stay in the Fitzwilliam it was a bit of a disappointment.

Have already recommended this to other people and would definitley book to stay here again - great hotel, close to everything",5,2010,06,29
226,Lovely hotel,"We loved the Fitzwilliam: great location, lovely clean rooms and friendly helpful staff. It was a bit warm in our room at night though - but that's the only tiny complaint I had. Really lovely breakfast (if a little pricey).",5,2010,06,29
226,Charming Hotel,"Just returned yesterday from a one nite stay and couldn't wait to post a review, this hotel is fantastic.
Check in was quick and very efficient and our room was ready at 10 am which was great!! The location of the hotel is excellent within walking distance to shops etc. The staff  are really pleasant and helpful. 
Breakfast was lovely served to our table although you help yourself to cereal and fresh fruit etc.
All in all had a great time and hope to return soon!!!",5,2010,06,28
226,GREAT hotel and restaurant!,"I had a wonderful stay here--except they forgot to call me for my wake up call!  Otherwise, the food, service and quality of the room were some of the best I've had since traveling in the UK.  My office booked me through LastMinute.com and I received the room at about a 60% reduction.  Enjoy it!  I'll be sure to be back here on my next Belfast visit.",5,2010,06,28
226,top hotel in amazing belfast,a real 5stars hotel in the heart of Belfast. service ok. interiors ok.,5,2010,06,27
226,Fantastic,"Not much to complain about with this place. Modern, luxurious and central, with a professional staff. The hotel is nicely decorated, and breakfast, which was wonderful, was included with our rate. A nice perk is that the Crown Liquor Saloon is practically across the road! Highly recommended.",5,2010,06,18
226,More Form than Function,"First let me say that the staff were terrific and that the hotel is nicely located for walking to restaurants, shopping and the university. 
The downside is the design of the guest rooms. No place to lay your toiletries etc. in the bathroom; reading lights above the bed that shine directly in your eyes; the corridor outside the room being  ridiculously dark and a multitude of other small annoyances that made us happy that we were just staying the one night.  It seems like a lot of thought went into the look of the place but little went into the practicality of actually using it.",3,2010,06,15
226,A lovely hotel - but can do better,The hotel is has a very good location and facilities but lacks the expected standards that might be expected from the grade of hotel. Upon checking in - we were asked for ¬£100 deposit for any hotel facitlities we may use - we declined this and said we will pay for the bar etc by cash. The rooms were very good but and Tea / coffee were provided in the room but no biscuits - which would have been nice. The room was serviced at night with a turn-down service which was nice. A glass of wine in the bar was ¬£5.25 - overpriced by Belfast standards. Upon checking out - we had to que up - in a hotel this standard surely this was unnecessary as our credit card numbers had been taken upon reservating and when we paid upfront for the room. The restaurant had irish stew on them menu for ¬£18 - needless to say we ate out.,4,2010,06,14
226,Best hotel we've ever stayed at! (and we travel a lot!),Staying here made me feel like a rock star. The rooms are like something from a design magazine. The location is excellent. The staff are extremely helpful and friendly. The restaurant (Menu) was amazing (this sounds like I am exaggerating but I'm actually not). Best salmon I have had in my life. We would consider coming back to Belfast just so that we could stay here again.,5,2010,06,13
226,Amazing!!,"Fantastic hotel, staff were so helpful and friendly. We used the hotel valet parking which was brilliant and the hotel staff were able to recomend where to go in Belfast and what to see. Only bad thing about our trip was that we were only staying in the Fitzwilliam for one night....Could have easily stayed for a week! Have already told everyone about this hotel and would definitely stay there again.",5,2010,06,04
226,modern comfortable trying to be new york chic,slightly cold surroundings everywhere from the stark entrance area to the dark (and I mean dark ) hallways. In belfast where security is a concern I would expect well lit hallways. Rooms are nice though small.,3,2010,06,04
226,"Cool, great location, great service but a bit noisy.","I booked online and got a great deal for a standard double room. The hotel is in an excellent location. It is however, located off the main street and can be quite noisy as there are two hospitals close by. The service is impeccable. The staff are extremely friendly and professional. The food at the bar was ok. The room was big and clean, ultra modern. I had an issue with the doors making quite a loud bang from the other rooms which I have informed the manager during my stay. Will definitely be returning!",5,2010,06,04
226,Great hotel - service - ambiance - location - perfect!,"I came to Belfast for a weekend by myself while working in Dublin. I picked the hotel for its location and the reviews I had read. The location was terrific a short walk to the city center and near great pubs and next to the Opera House. Loved the decor. The room had everything I needed or expected from a 5 star hotel including an umbrella which was great given that it rained the first day. I was most impressed with the service from the concierge who suggested I book a table at Menu for dinner after I inquired about the restaurant to the front desk clerk who took it upon herself to call me a taxi after I told her what I was trying to do while checking luggage. But the best example of their service was Gareth in the restaurant. He was part of my service team for dinner on Sat. night. He noticed me at breakfast the next morning. He stopped by, greeted me by name, and asked how my evening had been. That is the service I expect from a 5 star hotel. I can't wait to stay in another Fitzwilliam‚Äôs property.",5,2010,06,03
226,It has got to be the best hotel I have ever stayed at,I can not rave about this hotel enough. The style and expert service in which we recieved was with out a doubt the best you could ever wish to get. The pre theatre dinner was excellent and the staff in the resturant where so professional I could not complain about anything in the entire hotel. This is a must see hotel I promise you will not be disapointed.,5,2010,06,02
226,Slick design teams up with personal care and attention,"What a lovely surprise ! Great location next to the Opera House and just down the block from the City Hall Square and shopping districts.  Cool and fresh design with great colorways and gentle balance between modern-almost zen, and cozy.  Rooms have lovely delicate touches like candles in the room and bath, great bath products, tea service tucked away but accessible, great linens...  Afternoon tea by the groovy fireplace, and a generous lobby library are great touches to the common space.  Staff were MORE than accomodating and helpful, and the Irish spirit of hospitality is alive and well.  The FitzWilliam Belfast was one of the most pleasant travel surprises of late.  Would go back here in a minute !!",5,2010,06,02
226,Love it!,"My boyfriend and I stayed in the Fitzwilliam over the Valentines weekend and absolutely loved it!  We stayed in a superior king room and were amazed at how big the room was! We couldn't fault the quality or the decor, which was very nice! I have never stayed in a hotel with such an unusual style, and i loved it!

We had dinner in the bar downstairs and weren't really impressed with the service; the barman walked past me 4 or 5 times before actually acknowledging me, which I could understand if it was really busy, but at this time the bar wasn't.  However, the waitressing service more than made up for this, they couldn't have been more helpful and were very quick with drinks orders.",5,2010,06,02
226,Needs a lot of staff training,"We had to stay for 6nights,otherwise we would have moved.  Terrible lack of staff training and no managers around until several complaints were lodged by other members of the group. Rooms unmade at 5.30pm .Shortage of towels, even though they mention them in their ads. Gym, not as described. No water, dirty towels on the floor. Noisy, uncomfortable dining room. Poor service, terrible breakfast buffet that was not replenished all the time.. 
Bathroom had one small shelf for toiletries.Only 2 drawers for clothing and they were at floor level.  Very dark corridors.  Designer chic gone mad !!   Do they ever stay in the hotels they design?",2,2010,06,01
226,Fantastic,"i am a frequent traveller to Belfast and this was the first time i had stayed at the Fitzwillliam. I remember passing it on open top bus tour of Belfast when i was over last September and thinking `gosh that looks lovely - i could never afford to stay there'. Well , low and behold, when i was arranging my recent trip i was surfing hotels in Belfast and clicked on a `mystery hotel' which had an offer on - you dont actually see what hotel it is until you pay for it. I clicked on it and , guess what ? i got the Fitzwilliam.  I was not disapointed , From moment i booked in till moment i left they could not have been more helpful - the reception. breakfast staff, night staff......everyone !! Big thankls to Amy for sorting out my wine on the sat night when i couldnt get the cork out the bottle !!!(no laffing at the back now) My friend came down on the sat night and she was very impressed . I am already arranging my next visit over to Belfast later this year and will certainly be staying at the Fitzwilliam. My one, and only, moan - cost of breakfast very very expensive - mind u it does set you up for the day.",5,2010,05,31
226,Faultless,"Truly fantastic hotel with great rooms, spotlessly clean, ultra smooth service, fantastic breakfast, ultra smooth bar, great design and a cracking restaurant by any standard and certainly well above the standard of most hotel restaurants included in what is probably the best hotel I've stayed at in all of the UK. Location is great close by some fantastic restaurants within literally 1 minute walk - James St South and Deanes.",5,2010,05,30
226,One of the best hotels I have ever stayed in,"We stayed here for a weekend trip to Belfast and I can honestly stay it was one of the best,  hotels we have stayed in. We were met at our taxi and bags taken to room. Check in was friendly and fast. The room was gorgeous with a spotless bathroom, large room, wine in fridge, music player, huge window overlooking belfast, very comfy bed, just perfect . The room service was excellent, the burger was special! We also ate in the restaurant which is lovely and the food quality is second to none. Its a very design conscience hotel and the lobby is very stylish.  Tips - eat at St James street south, or Cayenne (michellin Bib Gormand award) both were ridiculosly good. Shopping is only a 5 min walk away and the hotel is a 7 pound taxi ride from the airport. 
Will def be coming back.",5,2010,05,28
226,"A Quality Hotel, with very pleasant staff, in a great central location.","The hotel was very pleasant and the Concierge took care of my car immediately. While there were road works immediately outside the hotel but their noise did not intrude in to the hotel itself. Check in was very prompt and courteous with that beautiful Ulster charm effortlessly offered. The room was lovely, modern, colour pastel green on black and clean. I was out for the evening and returned to find the bed turned down and the curtains drawn. I had to leave before breakfast at 7 a.m. Checkout was efficient and effective.",4,2010,05,23
226,Fitzwilliam Hotel central for everything,Stayed at the Fitzwilliam easy access to all the shoping areas and concerts. Parking was just across the road. Had a lovley room overlooking the city . The bedroom was modern and the bathroom had separate shower and bath.However the room was very warm and the air condition wasnt cool enough. All areas of the hotel was very warm. There was no body lotion in the bathroom just shampoo conditioner and shower gel.You had to ask for a bathrobe and slippers which for a 5 star should be in the room.I would prefer the Merchant Hotel as it has the little extras which make it special. I think it is more for a younger age group as the decor is funky and trendy.,4,2010,05,23
226,The place to stay in Belfast,"I had an overnight stay in Belfast which was the first time I'd visited this lovely city.
I chose to stay in the Fitzwilliam which was a decision which I feel made the trip for me. On arrival we were greated with amazing friendlyness and customer service which to be honest is one of the best I've had.
I was lucky enough to stay in one of the suites which was 5 star in everything from layout to comfort.
The hotel is located in an ideal position for the city centre as well as only a short walk from any attractions from the theatre to the Odyssey arena.
The biggest part of the stay was the staff, they went out they're way to assist in any way they could from simple chat to directions and assistance.
A great hotel with great staff.",5,2010,05,21
226,A marvellous hotel,"I have stayed in Hotels all over the world and this is without a doubt the best hotel I have ever stayed in. The staff were excellent, the food was very good and the overall ethos of the Hotel was excellent. The Hotel is situated in the heart of Belfast, right next to the Grand Opera House and is very convenient to all parts of the city either by foot and or taxi(which are not expensive).Valet car parking is  expensive, however it is very convenient for a City centre Hotel.The rooms are very nice, however they do have a tendancy to get quite hot. The bathrooms are very well designed and the showers are large with good water pressure. The restaurant is very good and the breakfast is really good. I recommend the Oats with honey, superb. All in all an excellent Hotel. We shall be back and we shall certainly now use other Fitzwilliam Hotels...",5,2010,05,19
226,"Excellent - Best Friendliest and most Helpful Staff, Lovely Place to Stay","Great place all round, staff are so friendly and helpful. They even have a pillow menu in the room. We chose Duck feather pillows with robes and slippers, the staff could not do enough to make your stay enjoyable. The best service I have experienced, you won't be disappointed. Great rooms, lovely lobby with feature fire place and good bar.",5,2010,05,19
226,Excellent in every way,"Truly wonderful hotel. Excellent staff, location, rooms.. Really can't find a fault with it at all.. It's probably one of the best hotels I've ever stayed in.. Would book it in a nanosecond if I was staying in Belfast again...",5,2010,05,19
226,I have stayed at many of the hotels in Betfast and The Fitzwilliam is right up there with the best.,"The staff were very helpful when I had any queries. The rooms are very well kept and clean. The large shower was amazing.

Only fault really was, opening the closet door to where the mini bar is enclosed before you come back to your room at the end of a night out was very cheeky and a bit of a sales pitch.

But overall 9/10.",5,2010,05,18

226,Fantastic aside from one individual,"It is a great location, central, but not to busy. Most of the people were fantastic, (one girl was very unhelpful with a room mistake.) The restaurant is fantastic, we should have eaten there both nights and the breakfasts were equally good. The room s are very modern and stylish but could do with some maintenance now, (minor issues).",4,2010,05,07
226,"Excellent location, beautiful rooms and very relaxing stay",The location was excellent. Room was very large and cosy with a very nice couch in the room. Bathroom was very impressive.,5,2010,05,05

Great location   parking not a problem",5,2010,05,04
226,what a place!,"I have never left a review for anywhere ever, but after staying at the Fitzwilliam in Belfast I had to say something..the staff are superb, without doubt the most helpful, friendly, knowledgeable, efficient crew I have ever had the pleasure of dealing with. 10/10!",5,2010,04,28
226,Fantastic place in the heart of Belfast,"I stayed at the Fitzwilliam for one night and was very impressed.  The rooms were spacious, clean and beautifully decorated.  The bathroom was amazing with a bath and waterfall shower.

We drank in the bar most of the evening as pretty much all the pubs were closed.  It had a cosy atmosphere and a cracking cocktail menu.  Drinks were quite reasonably priced too.  Breakfast was really good to and all the waiting staff very friendly.

The hotel is right next to Great Victoria bus and rail station which is really handy.

Overall a great hotel and I highly recommend it.",5,2010,04,27
226,Emperor's New Clothes with Ryanair style pricing!,"Methinks it doth protest too much...this hotel spends a lot of time blowing its own trumpet..after staying there I got an email which said: ""We hope the smile we put on your face is still there...The seemingly effortless charm and hospitality that has made the Fitzwilliam famous actually takes quite a bit of effort."" Granted the design is impressive, especially the lighting & mirrors in the corridors but the hotel falls short on welcome. I can't fault any staff member but the sense is of a place a little self absorbed and not as interested in customer delight. Maybe it's because everywhere else we traveled in the North we found the people to go out of their way to be helpful and funny, like they wanted us to have a really good time and that would perhaps be unsophisticated for this hotel? Hope you get the idea. One last thing, we paid an extra ¬£50 onto our quoted rate for parking and breakfast (my friend was charged ¬£15 for a bowl of cornflakes) so check the details of your booking to see what's included.",3,2010,04,27
226,Beautiful modern hotel,"Stayed here for a hens party this weekend. Gorgeous hotel and the staff are so lovely. Bit forgetful though ( had to ring down several times for robes and ipod leads) but overall they were lovely and couldnt do enough for us. One thing as well is when we ordered room service breakfast they brough t2 plates of full english but wed ordered eggs for one and vegaterian for other - was too hungover to bother complaining.
Overall you should stay here when coming to belfast - location is bang in heart of everything and its gorgoues place. 
Note to hotel - please fix the chair in room 312 - i fell off it and really hurt myself then noticed the leg at the back is broken!! 
Thanks",4,2010,04,27
226,This is THE ONLY hotel to stay in when you are in Belfast!! Service is outstanding!,"I only stayed for 1 night and the experience was a memorable one for all positive reasons.  Reception staff made me feel really welcome, room service quick, efficient & friendly & breakfast gorgeous - great selection & quality.  
I stay in hotels all around the world & this one for quality of service is up near the top!
2 parts to any service provided - the Technical side i.e. room, cleanliness, comfort of bed, quality & presentaton of food etc. & the People side - how the service is delivered to customers & it is the People side that your staff are superb at!  They must be well trained as they come across as truly genuine & really want to make the experience in your hotel a real positive & memorable one.  Well done - I will be back & have already recommended to loads of colleagues",5,2010,04,25

226,over rated,"Myself and a friend stayed in the Fitzwilliam Hotel in February for a special occassion.  Reading the previous reviews we had great expecataions of our trip and were really looking forward to the stay.  Througout our stay we found staff unhelpful, disinterested and rude, with the expection of James in Concierge who was excellent.  On departing our room we found hair rollers and a brush in a drawer, obviously not ours and informed the reception.  We recieved no apology and the attitude was again apathetic.  They got concierge to get our car, we travelled on the bus! The whole experience, from arrival to departure was disappointing,  
We took time after our stay to write several letters to the manager reagrding our stay and we still are waiting on a reply.  This I feel really sums up the attitude of this ""5 star"" hotel.  Style over substance!!",3,2010,04,20
226,"Lovely hotel, staffed by very friendly professionals","Due to the volcano we were forced to cancel our planned wedding anniversary trip to London. Not wanting to do nothing we decided to go to Belfast. A quick web search and we settled on the Fitzwilliam. In short, fantasic hotel, great facilities, nicest staff I've come across in a while. The bar is very cool and serves a great range of drinks, in a atmosphere condusive to chilling and enjoying them. Special thanks to Jonothan the barman and his Makers Mark recipie (he is difference between someone who works in a bar, and a true bar man). 
We took a corner room and the ac was not working correctly so the next morning I reported this to receiption and asked to move. Twenty minutes later we were in our new (ac fully functioning) room. Can't ask more than that.
Restuarant (Menu) very nice, great service - on hand but never intrusive. Breakfast lovely. All in all, can't find a single fault. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED HOTEL.",5,2010,04,20
226,"very relaxing, excellent friendly staff, great hotel !","We were on a one nighter away from the kids and needed something relaxing and comfortable. The Fitzwilliam in Belfast was perfect. ...even as we pulled up the concierge was at the car and helping with luggage (we had paid for the secure car parking...but he did not know that until he came out). The reception/lobby oozed relaxation and all of the staff were immediately very friendly and helpful. 
The room was extremely comfortable (superior) and very clean. Dinner in the restaurant was part of the one night deal we had and therefore it was a limited menu, but that did not take away from the quality of the food and service. 
Breakfasst the next morning was in our room (for which there was anominal charge) and was again superb.
I will and already have recomended this hotel to friends.
We are definitely going back.",5,2010,04,20

Staff were friendly and helpful. Bedroom was very comfortable and bathroom large with huge shower and separate bath. got a good rate on internet and can't wait to stay here again.,5,2010,04,19
226,Wonderful hotel,"I loved this hotel. We stayed for 2 nights for a work trip. Got a great deal on laterooms. 

Best bits
- Wonderful service
- Excellent style
- Good breakfast
- large rooms
- Central location. 

We could not have been treated better from start to finish. The service was faultless. I had forgotten to book breakfast online and when I called up beforehand to sort it the lady on the phone was so helpful. This carried on right until our departure. It really felt like a 5 star hotel. The bar is great - I can thoroughly recommend their french martinis. Breakfast was really good. Wasn't so keen on the lighting at breakfast where you felt a little spotlighted. Not good after too many French Martinis. 

Someone even came and lit the candles in my bathroom for me. Now you can't get much better than that. I left some clothing behind at the hotel and they even posted it back to me in Wales free of charge. I was so impressed that I emailed the manager on my return to say how fabulous our stay was and for the clothing return. Didn't get a response but they must get that a lot. I will definitely be going back.",5,2010,04,17
226,"Beautiful hotel, great stay, I'd go back in a heartbeat!","We were lucky enough to get this room at a bargain price on laterooms.  The normal cost was probably out of my budget in all honesty, but seeing the room I can understand how they justify the price.  The bed was really comfortable, the curtains were fantastic and kept out every ray of light for a really good night's sleep, and the bathroom was so posh and clean that I was waiting to get back there in the evening just for the pleasure of a relaxing bath in that beautiful room!  The staff were friendly and helpful and the rooms very quiet.  We didn't hear any of the other guests and thoroughly enjoyed our stay.",5,2010,04,17

226,Fantastic,"Belfast over the past few years really has become a city with a brilliant night life, fabulous restraunts and now top 5* hotels. The Fitzwilliam hotel on royal avenue is magnificant. me and my partner travelled to belfast to see a play at the opera house (conveniantly next door) and from the second we walked through the door we were being looked after. a polite young man took our bags and we didnt see them or him again until we had exited the lift at our room. the foyer is brilliant and when you reach the corridors they are dimly lit and elegant. upon entering your room you realise that you have entered a luxurious room. although the view is nothing to write home about it is fantastic to sit on the sofa that runs the length of the large roof to floor window and have a drink with the lights dimmed in the evening. your bed is a huge king bed infact when booking the hotel you realise that an executive king room is the bottom end of the rooms. everything is controlled by dimmer switches so you can have the lights bright or have the room set to dim light. also a tv and stereo are supplied in the room with cd's on request at reception. yes the mini fridge and restaurant are highly priced with a can of coke costing ¬£3  but the rest of the hotel certainly makes up for the money you WILL spend while staying there. the bathroom has a fantastic black and white mosiac effect wall and floors with a large walk in shower and stand alone bath and a large mirror spreading across the wall again with lights that you can dim if you want a nice relaxing bath. if you go out for the evening you will return to find the room tidied and the bed remade for you coming home with a menu of drinks and next morning rooms service breakfast menu on top of the bed.  if anyone ever comes to me again and asks for a good hotel in belfast only the fitzwilliam will come to mind.",5,2010,04,14

I really haven't got a bad thing to say. I stayed for business but would love to stay again with my partner or family.",5,2010,04,07
226,Excellent City Centre Hotel,"Overall this is an excellent hotel, it has first class facilities and the rooms were very good size, within an high claibre bathroom and shower.  Rooms, lobby etc are very modern with a few funky twists.  Check in was very fast and the staff were friendly and attentive.  We had a package which included dinner and while the meal was overall of a high standard the sides with our main course arrived cold.  The service in the restaurant was also fairly slow it took us 2hrs for three courses.  Breakfast the next morning was excellent.

We would definately stay in the hotel again as the room was excellent but in future take advantage of the many very good restaurant options within walking distance of the hotel",5,2010,04,07
226,"Lovely hotel, but not 5 star...","New hotel located in great location in the city centre between the Europa and Jurys Inn.
On the plus side...
Impressive lobby. Very spacious rooms with lovely decor. Nice big bathrooms with separate rain shower and big bath. Beds are huge and very comfy, and the blackout curtains keep the room dark in the mornings. Bar is lively with lots of cocktails being served on the Saturday night we were there. Didn't eat in the restaurant but couldn't complain about the breakfast either morning.

However for a 5 star hotel, I thought the service could have been better. In the information booklet in the room it stated we had movies on demand / internet on the TV. However this wasn't the case. I rang reception and was told someone would be up straight away. After 30 minutes I called back and was told concierge was busy and would be up ""soon"". A call back to say he was delayed would have been nice instead of sitting waiting for him to come. Also on the first night we requested the turn down service for 9pm (when out for dinner), but it was never done. When I mentioned this to the lady the second night I never even got an apology. I know these may seem like small things but for a 5 star hotel I'd expect the service to be 100%.

Overall I would stay here again, however theres still a few things that need to be perfected.",4,2010,04,06
226,Dissapointment in a romantic stay in our home city.,"For my wife's 30Th birthday I thought a romantic stay in our home city would be a quirky spin from the usual. We tend to travel a lot and are by no means snobby when it comes to accommodation staying in 1 to 5 star hotels. So being tourists in our own city of Belfast I thought I'd try one of the best on offer. The 5 star fitzwilliam ticked all the boxes, a reasonably new hotel in Belfast with a reputable chef in the kitchen. My wife and I booked a room for 1 night stay for 2 with breakfast and a table for 10 for friends and family for dinner that evening. One of our guests is very limited to what he can eat and we phoned a week in advance to see if arrangements could be made for him but were told he would need to make do with what was on the menu. 

 Our arrival and check in was courteous and the valet parked our car in the hotel car park at an additional ¬£17,50 for the night, if we'd have known this we would have got a taxi from our home to the hotel as we only live 6 miles away. Our room was very contemporary, modern and spacious with the all amenities you would expect of a hotel. 

While making preparations for dinner a knock at the door had hotel staff arrive to top up the mini bar at 17.00pm a half hour after we checked in. 

We finally met all guests for dinner a proceeded to the restaurant with great expectations only to be left disappointed. First the complimentary breads most restaurants in the world give were ¬£4 per basket, then no steak on the menu which is a first for all at the table I mean what restaurant on earth doesn't serve steak. Then they didn't have the wine we ordered and had to switch to another. Starters were ordered and disappointment followed out of 10 people only 2 were satisfied, portions were small, bland and expensive. The mains weren't much better, small duck breasts but cooked well, nearly raw salmon that lacked flavour and one of the smallest chicken breasts I'd ever seen. All dishes need extra accompaniments which were small dishes at an extra ¬£4 each with mains being ¬£15 to ¬£24. Desserts were again small and no one was blown away. Out of the 10 there was 4 non drinkers and only 2 bottles of wine and a couple of beers with the meal but the bill was still over ¬£400 with tip.

We proceeded to the ground floor cocktail bar for a night cap were the bar man rudely informed a guest of ours drinks would only be served to residents, our guest let him know quite colourfully that we had spent quite a bit of money in the restaurant and we weren't pleased with service and it wasn't getting any better in the bar so the bar man relented but we had to charge the bill to our room, they had no mint to make mojitos no orange to compliment cosmopolitans and other excuses for certain drinks. We ended up ordering a few beers and waters but the atmosphere fell a bit flat so after the first round the party of people broke up and went home.

After a good nights sleep and a very good breakfast if a bit expensive we checked out, on our final bill was items from the mini bar we didn't use obviously from the staff messing with it the night before, there was also a ¬£1 donation to a charity added to our bill without us being told which was only explained when I queried it, I had it removed from the bill on principle but did make a donation later that day to a selected charity.

While waiting on the valet to return our car I noticed him pull out of a side street to drive around the block to present the car outside the hotel, the valet must have thought he was driving a rally car as he sped up the road at a tremendous pace only to brake very sharply at a red light, I don't treat my car like that and was quite angry that this guy was driving my car so recklessly.

The whole experience left us underwhelmed and with a feeling of disappointment. The hotel itself is beautiful but the food and service are over rated and over priced the 5 star rating needs to be investigated.",2,2010,04,06
226,Lovely hotel in a great location,Lovely hotel but no free parking and rooms very noisy at night,4,2010,04,06
226,CHECK IF THE WINDOWS ARE TO BE CLEANED DURING YOUR STAY!!,"Stayed at the hotel for the first time availing of a combined Deluxe room/ Evening meal and Breakfast package. Initial impressions of hotel were favourable. The room was beautifully decorated and unique in its layout, room service was  exceptional in terms of the food quality.
Dining room was nice but uninspiring and was further inhibited by an absence of natural light. Staff were of a reasonable standard.
On returnng to the room a letter  had been left by hospitality pointing out that the windows of the hotel were to be cleaned at 8am the following morning  and stated ""apologies for the inconvenience"".
Sublime slumber was interrupted just after 7am by the noise from the diesel powered generator which brought the telescopic window cleaning platform into life.
This noise continued for the next 2 hours bringing to an abrupt end any further possibility of sleep or relaxation.  
At breakfast having been allocated a table  I returned from the buffet to find my table realocated. I was left holding my food as staff struggled to comprehend what had occurred and dithered about how to satisfactorily resolve this situation.
On checking out, the staff were unaware of the fact that I had corresponded my dissatisfaction re:  the window cleaning issue to the reception staff at around 715 am that morning.  
I eventually got to speak with the duty manager and outlined my criticisms.
Suffice to say his communication skills were poor and he was not suitably empowered to resolve this matter satisfactorily at this time. He assured me his manager would contact me after 4pm that day. Needless to say 2 days later I had heard nothing.
Further correspondence developed during which varying excuses were given by a member of staff ,none of which seemed plausible.  
In conclusion my stay was defined by interrupted sleep compounded by the hotels staff inability to take responsibility and communicate effectively to resolve these matters.
After much discussion I accepted  a derisory part refund, the alternative being a further nights stay (on a room only basis) the room offered being 2 grades lower  than previously booked.
I could detail so much more negativity but  I have already wasted enough of my time.

I will not stay in this hotel again and would suggest that those looking for a genuine customer-led hotel experience in Belfast should look no further than The Merchant or Malmaison.",1,2010,04,05
226,"Spacious rooms, great breakfast","Stayed here for one night on a business trip with a colleague and would like to have stayed more! 

We booked the Executive (cheapest) rooms through LateRooms and got a great rate of ¬£85 a night, inc. breakfast. On arrival there was a problem because the receptionist said breakfast wasn't included - it was on our confirmation, so it wasn't clear what the problem was. 

The hotel is very modern and right in the heart of the city, around the corner from the Europa Hotel and the Crown Bar. The bedrooms are spacious and well kept with large bathrooms and everything you could need.

We went to the bar for a drink which was very nice, but didn't eat in the hotel. This was a regret because the breakfast was absolutely superb - with wonderful presentation and a great choice of continental and cooked. We were there midweek and the hotel was offering dinner at something like ¬£20 for three courses, so on hindsight we should have dined in because the quality of food seemed very high. I would stay here again if I returned to Belfast.",5,2010,04,05

226,One of the best,"Agree with most recent reviews. Great hotel, attentive staff, relaxed atmosphere and location which is very central. One minor point was that we did get some road noise even on the 6th floor. The hotel is on a busy junction and the double glazing was not total effective.
However the room was great with a large bathroom (bath and shower cubicle) and nice soaps etc. Robes and slippers on request. Must also agree about the concierge who was cheerful, helpful and offered us umbrellas to face the driving rain. Cannot fault this hotel and if you choose it you will have a great base to explore the city both by day and night",5,2010,03,31

226,Brilliant Hotel ideally located,We stayed in the hotel for three nights as part of a trip to Northern Ireland and found it to be ideally located for exploring Belfast and the surrounding area. The staff were extremely helpful and directed us to all the tourist sites and attractions. Take a black cab trip around the Falls Road and Shankill areas if possible. The concierge arranged the trip for us and we were picked up at the door very promptly. The room was very modern and comfortable as is the rest of the hotel. We ate in the bar one night and found the food to be very good.The breakfasts are excellent and the service first class. All in all a very good hotel ideally situated for both business or pleasure trips.,5,2010,03,30
226,Great Hotel with Great Staff and Excellent Cocktails,"Had the pleasure of staying in The Fitzwilliam briefly whilst meeting up with friends. We were only there for one night but our friends had stayed four. No complaints from any of us - infact we all would go back in a minute

The rooms are a good size with large bathrooms with both a bath with a shower overhead and a seperate large shower cubicle with rainfall showerhead.

Staff were friendly and curteous and the barmen make a mean but reasonably priced cocktail. The bar was steadily busy but no waits to be served and all the staff where willing to help and make your stay good. 

Would recommend as beautifully decorated comfortable hotel with good service in a central location.",4,2010,03,28
226,Fantastic !!,"Superb hotel!! the balance between formal and relaxed atmosphere is just right. Excellant central location, everything is on your doorstep! i was there on business but would be happy to recommend it for couples on a city break or  a group of friends. As with many city centre hotels though i did not see much that would suit young children. Overall a very plesent experience.",5,2010,03,27
226,Utterly delightful!,"Mine was an utterly delightful stay: delightful staff (especially the lovely Terri); delicious evening meal; devine design & attention to design detail; devine room; wonderful fluffy bathrobes; sweet conceirge - nothing was too much trouble. You had an excellent write-up in The Times last weekend? - you deserved every word, and more!! I will most definitely be back, and will actively recommend this fab hotel to anyone I know who is booking a Belfast hotel.",5,2010,03,27
226,"Fantastic Hotel, Excellent Staff, Great Food & Beds. Stay Here in a Great Central Location.","Stayed for two nights here mid March and it was as relaxing as a two week holiday.  Centrally located near the europa bus station and five minutes walk to main shopping areas.  Lovely quiet hotel, great ambience, excellent breakfasts-proper juice, fantastic eggs benedict etc.  Relaxing large fire in lobby surrounded by books.  Could not fault this hotel in any way.  All of the staff we met added to our stay by their care and attention.Will stay here again when we return to belfast. Bourbon restaurant across the street is a great place to eat at reasonable prices-great wings and fish chowder etc.",5,2010,03,25
226,Perfect In Every Sense,"We had a spectacular 3 days in Belfast and Northern Ireland with the Fitzwilliam Hotel as our base and it was the perfect location for everything we wanted to do.
Right in the heart of downtown, a few blocks from City Hall and Belfast's own version of the ""London Eye"", next door to the Opera House, two doors down from the Europa Hotel and across the street from the Crown Bar. Even though the city center got a little quiet at night, there was plenty of life within a stone's throw of the hotel most evenings.
There is nothing bad I can say about this hotel. From the minute we walked in the door, every member of staff was attentive, friendly and courteous. The rooms were spacious, the bathrooms were impecable and the beds were comfortable. I would choose this hotel again in a heartbeat.",5,2010,03,25
226,Absolute Genius,"What can I say ? I've only stayed in this hotel twice now but from the welcome I recieved through to the bar service etc it really is something else.
Food is well priced, nothing is a problem and for being one year old the rooms are still immaculate with a ""showhome"" feel.  Can't wait to go back !",5,2010,03,22
226,One of the best ones,"Used it only for sleep and it is very good. Almost downtown, close to the good pubs.",4,2010,03,21
226,best night at home ever,i live in belfast but decided to get away for a night........to belfast...... just wanted to relax and do nothing.... the fitzwilliam hotel was amazing for this...a tranquil haven right in the centre of belfast who would have known it was possible to feel like you are in a different part of the world when your only 10mins away from home...the service was great the food delicious and the style of the room was chic but comfy and cozy at the same time....overall outstanding value for money .,5,2010,03,18
226,Sleep of 1000 sleeps,"Stay in the fitzwilliam and for little cost experience total luxury in the heart of belfast, and in the morning have eggs benedicint....to died for!",5,2010,03,18
226,An excellent hotel,"An excellent hotel, ideally placed in the city.
The evening meal was equally good, followed by a hearty breakfast the next morning.
Staff were very friendly and helpful, all very professional.
Would recommend this hotel without hesitation.",5,2010,03,16
226,"Good ambiance, friendly staff and great food.",Stayed overnight prior to mothering Sunday. Very efficient and effective receptionists for both check in and check out. Continued a conversation with you and showed concern about your stay. Large room with excellent large ensuite. The meal that night was excellent as was the breakfast. Restaurant staff took care and attention both in service and having a conversation with us. Went to bar for cocktails and were treated well.,5,2010,03,16
226,Friendly and very comfortable hotel,The fitzwilliam hotel belfast is a lovely hotel right in the centre of Belfast.  The staff were very friendly and the service excellent.  The bedroom was clean and very comfortable.  The bed was the nicest I have slept in.  Very comfortable.  Would not hesitate to stay here again.,5,2010,03,15
226,Excellent in every way,"I stayed at this hotel last summer and enjoyed it (and probably would have given a high rating) but found a vast improvement this time.  Staff were very friendly and helpful - making a provisional restaurant booking when I wasn't sure whether friends would want to eat with me in the hotel.  Dinner and breakfast were delicious (and the fixed price menu for hotel residents was very good value).  Rooms are lovely, location perfect.  Can't fault it!",5,2010,03,12
226,Could do better,We arrived at 4.40 pm and our room was not ready.The hotel is over priced for what you get.The food was just ok and we were wakened up at 7.30am by the noise of builders across the the road and street cleaners.We really were looking forward to our stay at this hotel but we would not recommend it.,3,2010,03,10
226,The Ultimate combination of comfort and sheer luxury,"The Fitzwilliam Hotel offers a service that is, quite simply, second to none to be found elsewhere in Northern Ireland. From the moment of arrival, to checkout, our every need was catered for. Upon arrival at Hotel Reception, I felt transported to a European city, forgetting that we had just stepped in from Great Victoria Street!
If we had one gripe, it would be the above average Bar prices. Had they been a little lower, our party would have found no reason to leave the Hotel for the duration of our stay.",5,2010,03,09
226,Sooo Lovely will definitely be back again,"We travelled from Cork on a 7am flight. Arrived in the hotel at 8.45am and the staff allowed us to check in straight away which was fab instead of waiting til 2pm. Really lovely stylish hotel. Rooms were very comfortable and even though our room was facing  the street, noise wasn't a huge problem (and I would be a light sleeper). Breakfast was really tasty with a good selection but it is pricey if not included as part of your deal. Staff were exceptionally helpful in all areas within the hotel . The only issue we had was that the air con wasn't working properly in our room but in fairness it wasn't a major issue as the rest of the stay was so pleasant. Its in close proximity to everywhere and you could easily walk to everywhere from it. Would definitely recommend it for a stay.",5,2010,03,09
226,Best place to stay in Belfast,A wonderful hotel with just the right amount of trendyness and service combined. Great food in the restaurant and room service. Staff goes out of their way to help. Would definitely go back.,5,2010,03,08
226,same as fitzwilliam dublin hotel oozes class,having stayed here before i knew what to expect ideal for city centre and transport bus and train station yards away also plenty of nightlife within walking distance no need for taxis having stayed at the fitzwilliam the weekend before they are both classy hotels,5,2010,03,06
226,Defo be back again,"When we arrived we were a little bit early so our room wasn't quite ready, so we were told to wait in the bar and we were supplied with free cofee's while we waited. Lovely touch. Our room was a deluxe double, well worth the extra few quid. Great view of city centre and very well laid out with plush fittings, king bed and gorgeous bathroom. Great location. Staff very helpfull. We were on 4th floor, little bit of traffic noise but nothing too bad for a city centre hotel. Had wonderfull meal on our first night, great choice and quality food. Courtisey car available also which was good on our departure to train. Over all great stay.",5,2010,03,03
226,Wonderful!,I would recommend this hotel to everybody. It was amazing. We did not want to go home. Everyone was very friendly (except the bar staff :( ) The rooms were fab. Great value for money.,5,2010,03,03
226,A first class accommodation in Belfast,"My wife and I were very impressed with our two-nght stay at the Fitzwilliam.  The staff were welcoming and very helpful. We arrived well before noon after an early morning flight from Edinburgh, and were able to check-in right away.  My wife had flown into the UK from Canada just two days earlier --and appreciated the opportunity to catch up on her sleep that first day.  We enjoyed dinner at the restaurant as well as our daily breakfasts.  Highly recommended as the place to stay in Belfast.",5,2010,03,02
226,"Beautiful Contemporary Design, shame about the Restaurant","We were both very much looking forward to returning to Belfast and staying at the Fitzwilliam.  We were made very welcome and were very impressed with the hotel decor and ambience.  Lunch in the bar was very nice, staff were efficient and cordial.  Our room was art deco, bright and welcoming and very comfortable.  All normal factilites available apart from the white bath robes (which I thought were a norm) had to be requested from reception!.  We decided on check-in to dine in the restaurant.  We were heading to the Odessy for 7pm and checked that our 5.30pm would allow us sufficient time.  We arrived at the restaurant at 5.30pm exactly, we were the first.  We were asked if we would like breads with some olive oil, we declined.  When we looked at the menu we would have been charged ¬£4 for this.  In all other top restaurants we have been to, this is normally free.   We chose the A la Carte .  We were told the starters would take 6-8 minutes which we were ok with but our mains arrived at 6.30pm.   We had told the waitresses of our 7pm appointment.  The food, well presented but bland, at those prices and with Kevin Thornton's reputation, we had high expectations.  Side of vegetables does not conjour up aubergine, courgette, onion and tomatoes - horrendous and at ¬£4 per little bowl. In addition, our bottle of wine disappeared out of sight to the ice bucket once we got our first glass.  We stared at our glasses on 2 occasions - they were empty!  I asked for the remaining wine to be sent to our room.  They definitely expected us to drink it direct, hot and from the bottle - no ice bucket or glasses.  There were 4 waiting staff on duty when we arrived but they were doing anything apart from taking care of their guests.  Why else would you dine at 5.30pm unless you had another engagement.  Overall, we found the food service poor and expensive (Cooked breakfast at ¬£18 - saw it and it looked nothing extra for that price!) for what we received.  We would recommend staying at the hotel but go to The Europa next door for dinner or Victoria Square.",3,2010,02,28
226,"Style,Opulance,great food,staff, location.","I booked this hotel via Laterooms and a three night stay cost ¬£212. Breakfast was on top but well worth paying for as all was freshly cooked. The interior,modern by design but not minimalist gave a feeling of stepping into luxury.
The bar serves the best cocktails and the staff are lovely.
The bedrooms are spacious and the bathrooms are too.
A nice touch in the bedrooms was the fresh coffee and cafitierre(a welcome change from the usual sachets of instant)",5,2010,02,26
226,Big comfortable rooms in the centre of Belfast,"I booked this hotel at the last minute, without having read any reviews and was very pleasantly surprised.  The rooms were big and airy which is unusual for a city centre hotel.  The bed was the most comfortable I have slept in in a long time, the bathrooms are really big with a separate bath and shower.  The staff are very helpful and the food in the restaurant is exclellent.",5,2010,02,22
226,Excellent,"Have just come back from Fitzwilliam Hotel.  We booked a standard room for 2 nights.  Check in was fine, receptions extremely friendly, room was lovely, big and spacious.  We went out for a walk, great location, situated between Jurys and Europa and only a walk away from all the shops. When we got back, there was a note put under the door telling us that there was going to be be building work going on at 8am the next morning, wasnt impressed with that, thought they should have told me when i was at reception. Anyway, went out and had a few drinks and a nice meal, next morning as promised the building work started, so that was us awake for the duration.  Anyway, when we went down the next morning, I mentioned it to the receptionist, told her we were away for the first time in 3 years on our own and wanted to be able to have a lie on. The girl was so helpful and seemed to totally understand where I was coming from. She apologised and agreed a note shouldnt have been put under  the door, anyway, she upgraded us to the most beautiful suite right next to the penthouse.  Have to say it made our weekend,  it was georgous, huge room, so relaxing. The shower was built for 2 or 3!! Anyway had a meal that night in the restaurant, i got quail, followed by venison and my husband got the pumpkin soup and steak, it was one of the best meals we have had in years.  The waiter, a new zealand guy was extremely friendly and was able to talk knowledgly about everything on the meunu without being over the top.  Anyway, im rambling now a bit, before we had kids we travelled a lot and stayed in some beautiful hotels and this is up there at the top!! Would go again in a flash and would recommend it to anyone.",4,2010,02,22
226,beautiful hotel but lacking service,"stayed here for two nights at the weekend. Had previously contacted hotel to confirm our late arrival and confirm a pre booked car parking space.  On arrival there was no car parking space for us and we offered a space to park in the loading bay but were told we would have to get up early on  saturday morning to move the car - hardly what you would call valet parking!!  the lady who checked us in was very helpful and friendly giving full information on dining options and breakfast the next morning.  Our room was on the 5th floor and was very impressive although as previous reviewers have mentioned very warm and it did take a long time for the room to cool down when the air conditioning was adjusted. I was very disappointed with water pressure in the showers - my power shower at home is easily twice as powerful and on the saturday night we both had to shower  with lukewarm water - again very disappointing for a 5 star hotel.
Breakfast room was lovely and we were quickly seated and tea and coffee brought to our table.  The continental breakfast on offer was very poor for a hotel of this standard and on sunday morning was very slow at being replenished.  The cooked menu was extensive and the quality of food was very good and served quickly.  Check out was fairly quick and again reception staff were helpful.  We did have to wait in the pouring rain for around 10 minutes on the concierge to bring our car round to the front of the hotel as they had forgot we were waiting!!!

Bar service was excellant although floor staff were very slow at clearing tables and we had to ask for the table to be cleaned on two occasions when other guests had left.

Overall we had a lovely stay but i feel that had i paid full rate for this hotel then i would have been very disappointed.  Would i go back - only if i got a really good deal - you can certainly get better service at other hotels in the city and at a much cheaper rate.",3,2010,02,22
226,Over priced for average food..,"We walked in off the street without a reservation and the maitre'd made a big deal before seating us. Wrong footed from the start? 

We started with a selection of bread, it was served with tapanade and pesto which I thought was a strange combination with the selection which included raisin bread??? My chum asked for butter... 

Starters - we had a crab cake between us... it smelled quite strong... I'm just not sure if fresh crab is supposed to smell like that? 

I had the salmon which was served with sorrel sauce  for my main. That was the only fish on the menu and the veggie option was pasta. I just don't want to eat pasta on a night out at the weekend no matter how good it is... The salmon tasted like farmed salmon no taste, quite fatty and the sauce was really bland... I was expecting the sharp tang of sorrel it was, however, a lovely vibrant green colour. There were girolle mushrooms on the side and they were cold and stringy. We told the waiter - he did nothing. The rest of my food was luke warm. My chum had venision and raved about it. We got one portion of mash and a portion of veg between us.. I thought the mash was way too salty. 

Dessert redeemed the meal - We split a chocolate marquaise with black cherrys... absolutely divine. 

The wine was also good - tasty chablis with the crab and we finished off with an El Boz (?)  Syrah that was full bodied and spicy, really good. 

Coffees and a sambucca each before leaving... 

Total bill came to ¬£127!!! Sorry to be a moan but it I really didn't think it was worth that.. the food was ¬£60 and just over ¬£60 for booze. My chum raved and thought the meal fab but mine was pure bland. Only the dessert and the red wine stood out. I  didn't think it was Michelin star level..  and not affordable as it said on their website...",3,2010,02,21
226,Very Good Hotel in Centre of Belfast,"Very happy with stay. Room was spacious, clean, and comfortable with excellent bathroom including separate shower cabinet. Only small issue was  audible traffic noise from the street outside despite being on the 4th floor. 

Had dinner in the restaurant which was average food for a a good value price (they have a special mid week menu which was available that night - so it is more expensive at weekends. Found the staff throughout the hotel very friendly if a little 'corporate and cold'. 

Finally, the breakfast was disappointing with a poor selection of cold items on a buffet and hot items to be ordered from a menu",4,2010,02,19
226,Over-rated and some fundamental flaws,"My partner and I stayed for Valentine's weekend. I booked the hotel based on a recommendation, I am a frequent businss traveller and a member of a number of loyalty international hotel chain reward schemes, so I like to think I have a very good understanding of hotels.Ok so here goes. Check in on the 12th was fine, smooth. Had an Executive Room on the 8th floor. The room was very small and somewhat disappointing given the money paid. The room consisted of  two twin beds which could be hooked together to make a double. Given it was Valentines weekend and we were a couple and had requested a double bedroom it was a tad disappointing that the room was laid out as a twin. The good news is that the hotel resolved this problem quickly.  The room's layout was obviously designed my a man! The only mirror in the main part of the room was bizarrely half hidden behind the flat screen tv, and the nearest convenient power socket was back towards the room door, so my girlfriend had to try and use her hair straightners at a full stretch and at a rather odd angle, much to my amusement and her frustration. The room's sound proofing was dreadful, you could hear everything in the corridors and the constant beeping oth the lift was a real pain, hardly the tranquility the hotel would have you believe. Like most city break tourists we spent precious little time in the hotel during the day and only used the basic facilities the hotel had to offer so can't comment on them in great detail. We did eat at the restaurant on the Friday and the meal was very good but the service whilst starting well ended poorly with us waiting nearly 40 minutes for our desserts and struggling to find a member of staff to get the bill, poor service at the end ruined the night. Final nail in the coffin for me was the check-out service. Basically you had to check out for Noon with no flexibility at all there which was a tad disapoitning given it was Valentines day but understandable all the same. On arriving down at reception there were at least 30 people queuing to check out, 20 minutes later we finally arrived at the front desk to confirm the bill was ok and hand the key in, why oh why no fast/express check out service? Not only a source of frustration but for a hotel of this alledged standard very disappointing. A positive is the hotel is centrally located but I suspect there are equally as good hotels nearby that are half the price and offer a quality standard of room and better value for money. Would I reocmmend the hotel? If you are happy to pay a premium for a noisy room, badly laid out and small in size with some fundamental service issues (including no parking faciities) and trade this off with an excellent location, the Fitzwilliam is for you, perosnally I will not be staying there again.",3,2010,02,16
226,Enjoyable stay,"My partner and I stayed here for a romantic weekend and for some shopping and this hotel did not disappoint us. It was really really nice, we really enjoyed our stay. The room was lovely and the bathroom was very nice also. We got a great deal online. Staff were friendly, in particular the concierge who offered advice on local eateries- the one we dined in was fantastic!It seems some reviews here are pretty bad- but I must say we had a very pleasant stay here and will return in the near future. We do travel a lot both on business and pleasure and would recommend this to a friend if visiting the city.The decor of the hotel was lovely also and very central just to walk to the shopping center and bars.",4,2010,02,15
226,Not the have of tranquility promised on their website,"I booked a so called ""loft studio""  on the 8th floor which was billed as a""haven of tranquility"" on their website. Besides being disappointingly small for ¬£250 a night, the room was very far from a haven of tranquility. The soundproofing is so bad that the traffic on the street below could be heard all too clearly ; even voices and footsteps in the corridor could be heard. But worst of all, the hotel did not tell us taht we would be woken shortly after 8 on a saturday morning with teh noise of work on a nearby building site. When we complained, we were told there was nothing the hotel could do; but surely for the duration of the building works, they could warn prospective guests that the promised ""tranquility"" was on hold ?
I could go on about the strange heating system that blows great gusts of hot air at the bed but leaves the bathroom icy cold and theSunday morning wake up call that was half an hour early but, for me, the lack of theclaimed ""tranquility"" was probably the worst. 
It's a pity because, with the exception of the over-early wake up call, the staff were very friendly and helpful.",3,2010,02,14
226,A jewel in the crown of Belfast,"Having previously stayed at The Europa I was anxious to try another similar rated and priced hotel for an overnight stay in Belfast.  I chose the Fitzwilliam as it looked bright, airy and modern - the decor does take a bit of getting used to!  My entire stay was a joy.  My only criticism was the automatic adding on my bill of a donation to Orbis.  I decide which charities benefit from my limited resources and I did not like being dictated to.  The amount was deducted from my bill without fussbut even so.  I would prefer a statement on the bill mentioning the charity the hotel supports and then giving me the opportunity ot donating by donation box or whatever.",5,2010,02,11
226,Very Central,"Stayed at this hotel for a special occassion even though I only live five miles away.  The hotel reception is cosy, but not worthy of a five star hotel.

Check in was very smooth, but read the notice at the right hand side of the reception desk carefully.  They automatically add a charge to your bill as a charitable donation to the cause of their choice unless you advise them differently - the receptionists neglect to mention this to you!!

We stayed in one of the deluxe rooms as it was a special occassion.  The room was beautiful, although we were only given one small bottle of complimentary water for two people!  The decor leaves a bit ot be desired though when you have had quite a few drinks - makes your head feel worse due to the patterns!  The corridors leadng to the bedrooms were very dimly lit making it quite difficult to see room numbers etc.  On a major downside - we could see into several rooms in the facing Jurys Hotel and I mean views of the beds etc!!.  We paid extra for the views of some of the streets and resented having to close the curtains. When we checked in we had to leave address details and contact details.  I left shoes in the room but only discovered this two weeks after checkout, yet the hotel didn't feel obliged to send me an e-mail, text message, drop me a letter or phone me (even though they had all this information)  - very poor standard - not the five star service you pay for. I was given the clear impression when I called of - we have your money now and thats that! 

We met some of our friends in the bar for drinks before going out.  This was 8pm on a Friday night and we were the only people in the bar!  They have quite an impressive selection of drinks behind the bar.  My husband asked for a specific rum which the waitress said they didn't do - but the bottle was clearly on display.  We ordered 2 glasses of wine, a g&t, a bottle of water and a cocktail - ¬£48!!!!  Thats why the bar was empty!

We didn't have dinner at the hotel so I can't comment on service, quality etc, but the menu looked beautiful.

Breakfast was nice, but I think I was looking for something a bit more up market for a 5 star hotel - I've had nicer buffets in 3 and 4 star hotels.  I have also stayed in the 5 star Four Seasons in Dublin and I think I was comparing breakfast - Four Seasons definately blew the Fitzwilliam out of the water for the breakfast!

I would stay at the hotel again, but only if there was a special deal, i wouldn't pay full price again.

On another note - you need to pay to park at this hotel - but yet there was cars on the very pavement at the front door?  Dont understand this as there are double yellow lines all round the hotel as it is on a major city centre route.

Its very convenient to the Europa Bus/Train Station, Open Bus Tour just across the street, City Hall less than 2 minutes.",4,2010,02,10
226,Fab hotel central location great service,"This hotel is new, modern and interestingly designed; saw it reviewed in a design industry mag and thought we'd give it a try for a quick weekend in Belfast as the photos looked great.
Nothing disappointed - class service from reception to concierge to bar.
Breakfast was lovely especially the proper soda bread and fresh fruit salad.
Our room (419 - we'd received an upgrade) was plush, large and the bathroom was clean with separate big bath and shower. The only point was that we needed more toiletries than were stocked - some lotions and shower gels were delivered promptly though. 
Extra points for concierge who sorted a taxi tour of West Belfast for us at pretty short notice.
All in all, an luxury setting to explore a buzzy, lively city full of contrasts and history - and very very friendly people!",5,2010,02,10
226,Great for city break,"This hotel is great value - we paid EUR180 for 2 nights. Given you're going to pay near this amount for any other half-decent hotel this one would be a good choice. The rooms are lovely and the entire hotel is non-smoking. Decor is very impressive and as detailed in other reviews the bathrooms are lovely! Flatscreen tv, very comfy beds, small complimentary water, mini-bar - usual but as other people highlighted you do have to request dressing-gowns and slippers. Free wi-fi is a great plus. 
Lunch menu in the restaurant is very reasonable - 2 courses for ¬£9.99 and the food was lovely. Bar is very nice, good atmosphere on the sat night we were there. Valet parking is excellent although costs ¬£17. There's a carpark directly across the road for ¬£12 and street parking is free after 6pm until 8am. 
Great location as it's only 5 minute walk to the wheel. Staff were very friendly. 
OK, definitely not the best 5* hotel i've stayed in but all in all it was great value for a city break - what more could you want.",4,2010,02,09
226,Does not qualify for 5 start status,"Our two-night stay was perfectly adequate, but it is simply is not a five star hotel. Our executive double room was the best bit - comfy beds, lovely shower, very quiet (on the 6th floor). However, you have to request dressing gowns to be brought to your room. We asked for slippers and didn't get them, lunch was really average and the bar is very lacklustre and slow. When popping in for cocktails before dinner, the staff took us to our table and put our drinks down, but didn't even clear the table of previous debris. Poor attention to detail sums it up for me.

In all, It just doesn't have that 'special' vibe that I believe you should feel when staying 5 star. If you can afford it - go and have cocktails in the Merchant Hotel instead and better still - stay there!",3,2010,02,08
226,Suite Retreat - perfect romantic getaway,"We stayed in the Fitzwilliam for one night.  We went for the suite as it is a rare treat to be away for a night, child free.  Cannot recommend these rooms enough.  We were on the 8th floor, so was lovely and quiet.  Massive bathroom, with a shower for 2 and a bath suitable for 2.  Perfect for a romantic getaway.  There is complimentary water in the rooms, although one small bottle between 2 people did seem stingy, given the price we had paid!!The hotel was busy the night we stayed so there was a nice buzz about the place.  All staff were very helpful and pleasant.  
We had lunch in the hotel bar, which was nice.  They had a special on for the six nations with a burger and pint for ¬£10 (not available with a soft drink, which is not so good if you are not drinking alcohol!!).  For breakfast there was a good enough selection, although maybe there could have had a wider selection given the standard of the hotel.  My husband opted for the cooked breakfast which was nice (if a little on the lukewarm site), I went for the pancakes, which were delicious and freshly cooked to order.
There was a bit of a queue for checking out on Sunday morning, although this moved pretty quickly, given we had paid in advance a quick check out option would have been good. The location is great, right in the heart of things.  Overall we really enjoyed our stay and would recommend it for a break away in belfast.",5,2010,02,08
226,"great value, great location!","great value hotel right in the city.  trendy decor, friendly staff & excellent breakfast. Couldn't find fault  with the Fitzwilliami, highly recommended for all.",4,2010,02,07
226,wonderful all rounder,"staff made the stay all the more enjoyable, polite and helpful despite being obviously busy, restaurant was a small let down but you can't have everything and as we both work in the hotel industry, myself and my husband are extremely fussy.
Would recommend without hesitation.",5,2010,02,02
226,"Clean, Central, Beautiful Interior","Stayed for a weekend in January, friendly staff and great location make this a good starting point. Hotel also has a beautiful bar and restaurant, attractive lobby and the room decor and view is exceptional. Well recommended.",5,2010,02,02
226,Would Return,"On arrival, the reception staff were polite however not exactly welcoming. Again polite on departure, but not service with a smile, no enquires about how we enjoyed our stay.
The room was stylish, clean and comfortable. The bathroom was of a very high standard.
The location of the hotel is hard to beat, minutes from shopping and restaurants.
I would certainly recommend this hotel.
I would point out however I received an e-mail asking for any feedback and gave the e-mail address to the hotel Manager / Asssist Manager. Having taken the time to make a couple of points I was disappointed not to get any response!!",4,2010,02,01
226,Best hotel I've stayed in in belfast,"Very good and friendly service, lovely quiet room, very comfortable bed.",5,2010,01,30
226,Good quality business hotel,"Nicely done modern hotel, with spacious rooms and friendly staff. A few downsides: room windows don't open, which is usually a reason for me to find another hotel. And they don't seem to have the hang of breakfast yet - burnt toast, and where did they get that orange juice from?",4,2010,01,29
226,Nearly a lovely hotel.,"A central location in Belfast right next to the Opera house. However, it would be hard for the hotel to live up to it's own hype: ""Cocoon yourself in sumptuous surroundings and create your own oasis of comfort"" means nice room with carpet. The tag line on the brochure states ""This is great. Really great. An wow, what a find"". It really should say ""This is quite nice. Really quite nice.""

Upon arrival, valet parking was convenient, the concierge efficient, and the front desk helpful. Room was modern boutique retro 70's green and chocolate coloured with a few geometric motifs about the place. Philips flat-screen TV, free WiFi, Sony CD player and dimmable ambient lighting. Disturbingly, the mini-bar had opened bottles of water in it - probably a previous occupant trying to avoid the ¬£3 charge for a small botle of water.

We had been looking forward to the meal. The food in the 'MENU' restaurant was tasty, but had hoped for something a little bit more special considering it's association with Kevin Thornton. Unfortunately, the service in the restaurant was dire. We had to ask for a bottle of water three times before receiving it, and it took an hour to get our desserts - it felt like the staff were actively avoiding eye contact. And ¬£5.20 for a 800ml bottle of artesian Norwegian sparkling water? (Or worse still ¬£10.40 for two bottles). Issues with water aside, there was a good selection of wines by the glass. 

Thankfully, the restaurant did redeem itself at breakfast. Prompt service, superb cooked breakfast and a huge array of fruit, yoghurt, cheese, meat and juices.

Checkout was speedy and issues with the bill were sorted on the spot. 

So all in all a relaxing break, and hopefully the next time we return the restaurant will have stepped up a gear.",4,2010,01,24
226,"Excellent, friendly service with a dash of charm from front of house","Excellent, friednly service with a dash of charm from front of house",5,2010,01,22
226,Top cool hotel in Belfast city centre,Really liked this hotel & very good value for money. Modern good sized clean rooms. Central location. Will definitely stay here again...would like to try out Kevin Thornton's restaurant. Only negative aspect is no parking but public car park nearby.,5,2010,01,20
226,"Fantastic service, great food, super room - we'll be back..!","Had a lovely stay, with the meal and the service being particular highlights.  Absolutely lovely hotel.",5,2010,01,19
226,Excellent Hotel,"Nice rooms, modern decor, well maintained.

Note: Most of the room are facing busy roads, so there is a certain Times Square feeling to the hotel.

Excellent Restaurant, brilliant service - 24 hour bar for residents!

The lobby area is a little cluttered and small, but u only notice this when it is full.

From the outside the Hotel has little presence, as it is one of these modern nondescript building, but once u get inside u the atmosphere is plush.

Good location, right beside the Opera House, one block from the city center and the main going out area in Belfast is up the road.",5,2010,01,12
226,A most enjoyable and relaxing experience,"A beautiful hotel in the heart of Belfast, close to all the shops and nightlife. The staff were exceptionally friendly and helpful.  We had a three course dinner in our package, which could only be described as 'divine' ; the chocolate fondant was delicious and I could have eaten it again for breakfast. The bedroom was tastefully decorated with the most comfortable hotel bed I've ever slept in.",5,2010,01,10
226,Warm and welcoming when stranded in Belfast by fog,"Great hotel.  Interesting decor, friendly and efficient staff, good value.  Arriving as a tired and grumpy traveller when my flight back to London was cancelled, I was transformed within minutes by the welcome and warmth.",5,2010,01,10
226,A perfect retreat in Belfast,"A truly wonderful hotel in the heart of Belfast. The rooms are beautifully designed, uber modern influenced by Artist Bridget Riley - black and white with hints lime. Everything about our stay was perfect - the staff, the hotel location and breakfast was delicious ( we didn't have dinner in the hotel). The Hotel is most definately a 5 * ( we popped into the Europa Hotel piano bar which was next  door and also classed as a 5* but it wasn't a patch on the interior of the Fitzwilliam).

Top tip: eat dinner at 'Made in Belfast' restuarant during your stay. The food is local faye and is as fresh as can be. A very quirky arty style restaurant, surroundings that might not suit all but our very fussy older eaters were blown away by the quality of prawn starter and steak.  Its a 2min walk from hotel but you must reserve a seat in advance as it gets busy - Wellington Street/ Wellington Walk i can't quite remember?
 
We also took the Belfast tour bus that pionted out famous landmarks and drove through the previously troubled areas. It felt strange driving through these areas being spectators in real peoples lives, a bit incomfortable but really important to fully understand the cities history i guess.
 
Will definately be back again.",5,2010,01,07
226,Beautiful and luxurious hotel,"The Fitzwilliam was the best hotel we have ever stayed in.  The rooms were beautiful, spacious and very comfortable.  The separate bath and shower were also very decadent.  Also a perfect location in city centre.  My one complaint is that the food in the restaurant was a bit too picky and the portions were rather small.  Although in saying that,  I wish we had stayed at the hotel for longer than 4 nights.",5,2010,01,05
226,Wow,"This is a really gorgeous hotel, black and lime green theme, wonderful lobby and lounge and breakfast looked like artistry and tasted just as good. Definitely would recommend and in easy walking distance of restaurants, would recommend Cayenne if you are looking to impress, or if you fancy a very good value beautifully prepared meal.",5,2010,01,04
226,not quite there yet,"Having finally got the snooty, unfriendly receptionist to accept that I had already paid for my room 
( about 15 minutes later and a lot of her staring at the computer screen) I made my way to my very acceptable room ,via the lift with the dirty carpet. The housekeeping trolley never left the corridor for the duration of the stay.
We had arranged to meet friends in the bar - dark and lacking atmosphere.
The bar man had the worst cough ever - I sympathise but after coughing, rubbing your nose and sniffing PLEASE wash your hands!! Also - note to said barman after this DO NOT sniff the top of the bottle to see what the vodka smells like in full view of me!
The glass my drink arrived would have been unacceptably dirty in a wild west saloon never mind a 5* hotel. It was returned and replaced without bother. We had planned to eat dinner in Kevin Thorntons restaurant ,but if this type of substandard hygiene practice goes on in front of guests, what in God's name would it be like in a closed kitchen?!  So we left when our friends arrived depriving the restaurant of 7 customers and a few drinks in the bar. In this current economic climate I would say no where could afford to do this.

Don't get me wrong the room was grand and the male receptionist on check out was a nice helpful guy. But I wouldn't stay again because there are nicer hotels in Belfast where the service is a hell of a lot better. 
They could go up the road a bit to 10 Square and learn a bit about customer service which was pretty much non existent.",4,2010,01,03
226,A Very memorable 50th Birthday,"Stayed at the fitzwilliam for my 50th birthday. From the moment of check in staff were professional and friendly. Our room was a deluxe on the 6th floor. We did not want to leave the room. Bar staff  very helpfull and friendly. All the staff we encountered were excellent. The breakfast was unbelievable fresh orange juice and cooked to order breakfast.  Keep up the high standard,",5,2009,12,29
226,"Fabulous, luxurious, stylish & friendly","We've just returned from a 3 night stay at the Fitzwilliam in Belfast and can honestly say that it is one of the very best hotels we've ever stayed in.
The staff were welcoming, friendly and extremely helpful... on the Saturday evening when we rang down to ask for a corkscrew and some matches to light the candles in our room, someone was with us within a couple of minutes, and when he realised we only had a couple of candles, he came back with another five so I could have a candle lit bath.... now that's what I call really great service!
The hotel is smart, fashionable and very centrally located  - right alongisde the Opera House and over the road from the Crown Saloon - so everything was within easy walking distance. 
Our room was spacious, stylish, clean and very comfortable, and the bathroom was beautiful with a fabulous deep bath & a large separate walk in shower. 
The little finishing touches really made a difference too -  from the umbrellas in the rooms for use during the stay to the cafetiere & coffee, it felt that everything had been thought about.
I would thoroughly recommend this hotel  - we had a really fabulous weekend here!",5,2009,12,22
226,Excellent location and ambiance for a seasonal trip,Excellent base for a Xmas shopping trip - rooms of a high standard and would feel we got excellent value for money. Only downside was a slightly disapointing meal but it was Xmas party night,4,2009,12,22
226,"Hotel was superb, good size room and bathroom would highly recommend to anyone",Located right in the heart of the city centre near loads of clubs and pubs and restuarants.  Hotel rooms were modern and spacious and decorated with taste.  Staff were friendly and very helpfull.  Excellent cocktail bar.  Would definitely stay here again as I felt I got value for money.,5,2009,12,21
226,"Horrible staff, poor value","The staff are rude and untrained.  They refused entry in to the hotel after midnight until they verified by ID, leaving me outside in the rain.  The room service food is poor and the fittings in the room are cheap.

They do have a good location.",1,2009,12,19
226,Great place to stay,"Stayed for one night, the hotel was very busy and reception staff pleasant and welcoming. The foyer is smaller than expected. The basic (executive)rooms are very clean and comfortable. Nice bathroom with a seperate bath and rainfall shower. We ordered a room service breakfast for 10am to 10.30am which was late but a phone call to room service assured us it was on its way. The tray charge of ¬£4 for the  made to order breakfasts was good value and more importantly the food was delicious. The bar has a great range of drinks and cocktails and the food looked good. The Europa Hotel is a practically next door as is the train station the Crown bar is across the road from there and there are plenty of restaurants nearby. 
Valet parking is available for ¬£17 per night with a nice friendly valet, it is nice to have safe parking with the  car warmed up and ready for take off.  City centre parking rates are generally expensive and Belfast is no exception.
The only let down we had was the 20 minute queue for check out on the Sunday morning. It is such a pity this five star hotel does not offer express check out.",5,2009,12,19
226,I can't recall when was the last time I experienced such great service!,"Service was excellent from the minute we stepped into the hotel to the minute we left. Our room was clean, modern, classy, spacious, comfortable. The location was good as it was near where the bus from the airport dropped us off and where the aircoach to Dublin left. It was walking distance to the main city centre area too. We tried the restaurant and though I wouldn't go back again for the food, I might go back again for the service. Internet was free and the only problem we had during our stay was that both of us couldn't use our laptops concurrently as only one account was set up per room (our guess) but that was easily resolved by the friendly staff. Our room was GBP85/night and we wished there was more in Belfast and its surrounding areas to see so we would have stayed more than 2 nights. Extremely value for money for the quality of the room and the service you get. Highly recommended!",5,2009,12,19
226,I had the smallest piece of venison it was possible to serve.,We went for Sunday lunch . It was  a bleak dining room with no atmosphere . Nearly empty . Portions tiny.  When I emailed the hotel afterwards they would take on board my feedback and instruct the chef to serve larger portions of venison. Not much good to me!,2,2009,12,19
226,Excellent service and standards highly recommended,Very friendly and efficient.  I left my Iphone in my car and the valet Philip brought it up to me without being asked.  The room service was the best quality I can remember (the pea and ham veloute is exceptional). Overall standards very high and I congratulate the staff on the levels they have achieved at this hotel.,5,2009,12,17
226,What a perfect way to spend a relaxing week-end,"Met by freindly professional staff on arrival. My room wasn't ready so they took my mobile number and rang me within an hour. The room was nice and clean and laid out perfectly. Everything was perfect in the room. Tea, coffee making facilities, a lovely comfortable bed and a nice clean bathroom. Perfect! I would highly recommend the restaurant. Excellent food! I will be highly recommending this hotel to friends and family when they visit Belfast.",5,2009,12,17
226,"Fabulous Hotel, right in the heart of Belfast.","A fabulous Hotel right in the heart of Belfast. The Rooms were very large & luxurious and for a hotel that was situated directly on one of the main thoroughfares in Belfast was remarkably quiet at night. The staff in the Hotel couldn't  have been more helpful during our stay there. 

There is a lovely trendy Bar on the Ground Floor of the hotel that must have the largest drinks menu I've ever seen! I would recommend this hotel to anyone, young or old, to stay in if visiting Belfast.",5,2009,12,16
226,Very weak on the basics - will not be returning.,"Spent 2 nights in the Belfast Fitzwilliam and was not impressed. 

Highs: 
> Good location in the centre of town. 
> Friendly & efficient check-in. 
> Good breakfast all cooked to order.
> Nice bar with intersting drinks menu even though service was very slow. 

Lows: 
> Room service was prompt but grubby with dirty plates and an incomplete order. 
> No quick check out option. Very long queues on Sunday morning which is understandable but don't make us wait for 20 minutes.  
> Standard of cleaning was shocking!
- Carpet in the lifts was very grubby as was the carpet in the bedroom. Very obvious a hoover didn't touch it. 
- We left the room early on Saturday and when we returned at 3.30pm it still hadn't been serviced.
- When we returned again late on Saturday night the room had been serviced but barely. Bed was made and general tidy done but toilet was not cleaned, mirrors were not polished, toilet paper not replaced, shower gel etc not replaced and empty drinks glasses from the bar the previous night not removed! All in all - very poor. 

All in all the hotel is too focused on being trendy without delivering on the fundamentals. Back to basics and start again please!",2,2009,12,15
226,Happy as can be,"I chose the Fitzwilliam Belfast because I normally stay in the Dublin one when visiting Dublin.  I was very lucky to get a very good special rate too.

The rooms are beautifully appointed, bathrooms too.  Very much like the Dublin one, but I thought it was even just a bit nicer.  Great location, across the road from the Crown.

One down mark, we came back late after a concert and a party, were starving and were not able to get room service to pick up the phone. I let it ring 3 times, our friends tried too and also no luck.  I mentionned it the next day, there's nothing they could do much except say sorry.",5,2009,12,15
226,"Great hotel,  Pity about the breakfast","Modern Trendy hotel in great location close to Belfast Wheel and the shopping.
Great rooms with CD player included.  Bathroom good size with separate walk in shower.
Only disappointment was the breakfast.  Took for ages and when it finally arrived the bacon was not cooked very well and the poached eggs were hard and slightly cold!!",3,2009,12,14
226,Style and substance at the Fitzwilliam,"Just back from a weekend stay at the Fitzwilliam, Belfast and would recommend to those looking for style and substance from their hotel. The Fitzwilliam is contemporary with the design of the bold but comfortable lobby - complete with sofas and easy chairs around the open fire - continued into the superbly quiet corridors, with moody lighting, lux carpets and mirrored doors leading to large, light bedrooms. Big bathroom with lovely pampering goodies, candles, double size walk-in shower and separate bath. Huge bed with choice of pillows guaranteed a good night's sleep after a day's Christmas shopping. 

All of the staff were friendly, attentive but unobtrusive - great service all round. Bar is a popular venue for residents and visitors so be warned that it can take time to be served as cocktails are the drink of choice - that said it's a good atmosphere with a real mix of ages.  Other than breakfast, which was excellent and extensive although pricey if not on your room rate, we didn't eat in the hotel as there are too many superb restaurants within walking distance - can recommend James St South. 

Hotel was almost full when were there and the bar was busy with Christmas just around the corner but once in our room we didn't hear a sound. The quality of the hotel and its location just a 5min walk from Donegall Square made the Fitzwilliam a good choice. My husband has stayed at the Europa and Jurys (both next door) but is now a convert to the Fitzwilliam.",5,2009,12,14
226,VERY DISAPPOINTING,"I don‚Äôt know what hotel I stayed in recently but it certainly didn‚Äôt bear any recognition to that which features in some previous reviews.

We booked in for a special occasion to a suite for one night at ¬£225 but didn‚Äôt come away feeling special. Judging by previous reviews of the standard and deluxe rooms we thought we would be in for a real treat, however we were disappointed. We checked in, there was no offer to help us with our bags to the room, and took the lift to the 8th floor. While the room has the design wow factor, the functionality of the room has suffered.

The mini bar wasn‚Äôt stocked properly.

There was no hairdryer in the room.

I was looking forward to freshly brewed coffee as other reviews mentioned cafetieres but we had a kettle and sachets of coffee ‚Äì not a cafetiere in sight.

After the turn down service one of the key cards was lifted from the room which left us feeling vulnerable security wise.

While the Hotel advertises music systems which are ipod compatible it fails to mention that you need an AV lead to be able to use your ipod.

The foot stool was missing two covered buttons ‚Äì not acceptable in a suite in a 5 star hotel, especially such a relatively new hotel.

The toilet doesn‚Äôt have a wash basin.  You have to open the door and go out into the room to wash your hands.  Shelves beside the wash hand basins are tiny and have very little room to hold toiletries.

We couldn‚Äôt get a seat in the bar which is very small and occupied with locals.  Why not have an exclusive resident‚Äôs bar for those paying to stay in the hotel.

My husband had to wait 15 minutes to be served in the bar, then they didn‚Äôt have a cocktail list behind the bar and he was told to go and lift one off the tables which were all fully occupied. They then said they were too busy to make cocktails!  

We had room service, which was OK ‚Äì nothing great.  Accompanying condiments were non-existent.

The dining room is reminiscent of a narrow train corridor with seating compartments off it. I ordered buttermilk pancakes and strawberries for breakfast.  The pancake was as tough as old leather, the strawberries was one strawberry cut into slices.  

On mentioning some of these points at reception on check out they didn‚Äôt seem to care and said we should have phoned down to report anything that was wrong.  I think they missed the point that these things shouldn‚Äôt have happened in the first place and if we had phoned down we would have spent the whole night on the phone! On the plus side the valet parking was great ‚Äì the car was waiting for us immediately we checked out and the location is good.  However if the Hilton was beside it I would chose the Hilton every time.

Obviously Northern Ireland Tourist Board give out 5 stars very easily as the service and facilities are severely lacking compared to other 5 star hotels I have stayed in.",2,2009,12,14
226,Luxury with wonderful Northern Ireland hospitality,"From the recepionist on our arrival to the concierge when we collected our suitcases for departure the staff at this hotel provide a warm welcoming professional service. The room was wonderful smart,chic decor with extra touches like an umbrella for use during your stay (useful in Belfast) and a caffetiere with filter coffee as well as other tea and coffee making facilities. The breakfast was excellent with a great choice of cooked items which were cooked to order. This beautiful hotel is in an excellent location with the heart of Belfast city centre only a 5 minute walk away. On my many visits to Belfast I have watched this hotel being built and now it has been a great pleasure to stay in it.",5,2009,12,13
226,lovely modern hotel,"Went for a night away with a friend.  The hotel was in an excellent location, it was modern and the bedrooms were modern and trendy.  The bathroom was amazing with black sparkly tiles and bathrobes.   When we arrived at the hotel we discovered we had a free upgrade as well.  Did not eat at the hotel so could not comment on that.  I would definitely recommend this to a friend.",5,2009,12,10
226,luxury at a good price,"Decor was splendid. Bed was comfortable. Free wifi. The best, more spacious bathroom we've ever encountered in the UK and/or an EU country. Good location, with a Saturday food market down the street, excellent pub across the street, and city center nearby. Clean, modern, affordable for the high standard. I dream of coming back to stay (especially after seeing the equally beautiful, but much more expensive sister hotel in Dublin--I really appreciated the value then!).",5,2009,12,08
226,Too expensive!,"I'm in the minority here with a negative review...our twin-bedded room was very small compared to the double bedded rooms the rest of my family were given on the 5 floor. When I asked about the difference I was told that all rooms were the same and that rooms on the 5 floor just seemed bigger. Obviously my spatial awareness is at fault! I'm not sure why i had to pay the full price for my stay on checking in because I only carried a debit card. I have not had this happen in other hotels. The bar was a nightmare - too loud music, too small tables and service was awful! We waited 20 minutes for a simple drinks order which at least gave us time to prepare for the prices! Don't bother with the Guinness-it's nowhere near as good as in a local bar. 
Breakfast prices again are ridiculous for what you get. Location is great but there are many more hotels in the vicinity which are better value.",3,2009,12,08
226,"FIRST CLASS HOTEL, HIGHLY RECOMMEND!!","Just back from overnight stay at the Fitzwilliam Hotel, I have to rate it higher than the Hilton.  Excellant location, be prepard this hotel has the WOW factor.....entrance is really beautiful and most welcoming, fire buring beautiful surrondings and of course the christmas tree...Very elegant design.  We stayed in room 506 on the 5th floor. The room was exactly like the pictures on the hotel webpage, and the bathroom is something else..  The bed is massive, plenty of pillows and extra blankets if needed. The tempeture of the room was pleasant, although we found the room to be quite warm throughout the night. This is not a problem when its 2 degress outside. There is the usual tea/coffee, tv, hifi with mp3 adaption,hairdryer, iron and ironing board, dressing gowns, and slippers and georgus toiletries.  The staff are very pleasent.  The food was superb.   The location is perfect - 5 min on foot and you can be anywhere...... Try the Bourban across the road, up a few doors from the famous Crown Bar, for evening meal....hmmm.delicious.. Anyone travelling from Ireland I would advise to arrive by bus or train, the traffic is awful (we did arrive at 5pm - bad time)   The train/bus station is literally 3min walk to hotel. The hotel carpark costs ¬£17 per night.   The Hotel is right next to The Opera House, great if you are going to a show.   No taxis are needed for your stay even though they were plentyful.",5,2009,12,03
226,Functional modern design with great views of the city,"Why choose the Fitzwilliam?  If you want a top quality hotel (not a cheap one) with (1) great location, a few blocks from city center; (2) modern design with colors and clean lines (v. the ornate nature of the Merchant); (3) friendly service; and (4) reasonable rates compared to other hotels of this class.

We stayed in a deluxe room, #702,  which is the highest floor you can be on in this type of room.  The deluxe rooms have a corner location with floor to ceiling windows affording great light and views.   See photo. The only downside is street traffic noise - if sensitive, bring ear plugs.

The room photos on the hotel website are very accurate.

There is a very small gym with three pieces of cardio equipment and a few weights - enough for a quick workout, but not much more.  No spa, if that matters to you.

Have to pay for parking - it was 17 pounds Sterling a night.   And you need to arrange it when you reserve, because they have limited spaces.  They valet and it's easy, although you can probably find cheaper parking nearby.

Plenty of space in the room, except for luggage - had to stash it in a corner.  Nice couch, CD player, desk space.  Bathroom large with separate shower.  Only downside was the lack of shelf space in the bathroom, and the lighting was borderline in the bathroom.

We did the package with dinner one night and breakfast each morning - seemed to be a reasonable deal, although we didn't comparison shop.  If you don't like going out in search of breakfast, take the hotel's option.

Also, take a Black Taxi tour if interested in the politics of Northern Ireland - Frommer's has a page recommending a good one.",5,2009,12,02
226,Fitzwilliam perfect in belfast,"Booked as a treat for christmas shopping & visiting friends.  Perfect location in middle of city. Staff soo friendly & efficient without being stuffy or false. Fab-u-lous rooms, loved it!  The colours were greens/black/white and a to-die-for bathroom! Bestest thing are the black out curtains....complete blackout, great for nursing hangover & excuse to stay in bed!!!  Great room service and quick! although very limited choice after 10pm.  Careful not to move anything in the mini-bar or they'll think you drank/ate it, but are more than happy to remove this from bill upon departure. James the conceirge was lovely and full of information and happy to chat away with you. Breakfast I paid for when booking (¬£10 pp) a bargain compared with ¬£20@ for the full works if paid at the hotel. Great choice for breakfast and all cooked to order. Mirrorred doors in corridors great for that final check your looking your best.  Fab bar with amazing selection of drinks Ive ever seen.  Cant wait to go back!!!",5,2009,12,01
226,Fantastic,"I would have no hesitation in recommending this hotel. It is in a great location, just 5 mins walk from Gt. Victoria Street station and across the road from the amazing Crown Bar with all its charm and history. 

The service in this hotel was faultless: friendly, welcoming staff. The lobby featured a modern fire place which was very inviting and lovely to relax in. No complaints either about the food in the Menu restaurant - it was very good.

The view from our room was the best... it is seldom I walk into a room and go wow! but I did here. The room included all the creature comforts including a huge comfy bed with soft pillows.

I will definetely visit this hotel again.",5,2009,12,01
226,Another Great Stay,"I have recently stayed at the Fitzwilliam Belfast for the 3rd time and I havent been disappointed.We stayed on B+B + evening meal deal which was excellent value.The meal was excellent as was the breakfast.The hotel rooms are of a good standard and the hotel is in an excellent position for shops,bars and nightlife.I hope to return again soon.Do yourself a favour and give it a try.",5,2009,11,30
226,Excellent hotel,"Couldnt fault one thing about this hotel, the room was perfect and the location top notch, I wouldnt recommend drining a car as parking would be expensive but with the train station 2 mins away its not needed.

The staff a very friendly and helpful, Look about for deals for this hotel, I got this stay for ¬£66 per night which is fantastic for an executive room, Bar prices are no more expensive than normal city centre bars and you are in the very centre of town for everything you would need, 

Will be trying  this hotels sister in dublin and hipefully is up to this high standard",5,2009,11,28
226,FABULOUS FITZWILLIAM,"Myself and 5 girlfriends stayed in the fitzwilliam to celebrate my 30th Birthday!  We only wish we were staying longer than the one night!  The rooms were fabulous (we even managed to get a free upgrade to a superior room).  The service from check in to check out was fantastic!  The little touches like candles in the room, cafetiere for coffee and the cd library make it extra special!  We chose not to eat in the hotel as we had made dinner reservations elsewhere but breakfast was out of this world!  By far the best in any hotel ive been in!  The bar was great with a lively atmosphere - and the cocktails are divine!!  I am now pestering my husband to take me back again!",5,2009,11,24
226,Very relaxing Hotel of excellent standard with great location.,"Well done to Fitzwilliam. This hotel has created a very modern theme and been able to keep a cozy and relaxing ambiance. The staff have to be commended for there friendliness and helpfulness. The cooked breakfast was amazing, excellent value for money . Breakfast was served until 11.30 am very relaxing!  Rooms are large with excellent facilities,bed was very comforable beautiful bed linen. Hotel bar was cozy with a lovely atmosphere. Location was stop on next to Opera House,train station,local bars,walking distance to main shopping area. Open top bus tours have a bus stop just outside the hotel well worth doing, book this online its cheaper!       We had an excellent time will definently go back.  The only thing you need to be aware of is the Hotel parking not cheap, we used the train.",5,2009,11,24
226,5 star hotel with a true 5 star service at very competitive prices!,"A true 5 STAR service at very competitive rates, very spacious rooms, clean and luxurious with the best walk in rain shower i have experienced! The attention to detail is phenomenal. View from the hotel look over Belfast's busy streets or over the grand opera theatre. Fantastic location walking distance from most bars, clubs, shopping centre and attractions. Everything you need for a pleasant stay, Privileged to get to know the staff Gemma, the night manager and James the concierge both are amazing and would tender to your every need. Food in the hotel is to die for, you may find yourself dining, drinking or staying with celebs, need i say anymore? The lounge makes you feel at home and the ambiance of the hotel distracts you from the fact your in the middle of a capital city. Overall probably the best hotel you'll stay in whilst visiting Belfast i would recommend it to everyone.",5,2009,11,24
226,"Excellent hotel, with some minor flaws. Great location.","The Fitzwilliam is an excellent hotel with a great location in the centre of Belfast. The staff were really friendly with none of the stuffiness you associate with some of the other 5 star hotels. We had dinner and breakfast in the restaurant which was superb. Only a couple of minor flaws. The air con in our room was not very efficient, it was hard to maintain a comfortable temperature and there were a few cracked wall tiles in the bathroom which was surprising for a new 5 star hotel. Overall though, very good and we would stay again.",4,2009,11,24
226,Lovely Lovely Lovely!,"We stayed in room 510 for two nights for a short weekend break, and this hotel was close to perfect.  Check-in was friendly and efficient, the room was lovely; classy decor & design and large enough to have a cat-swinging party of you wanted to.  Had all that you'd expect, & of a high standard, plus absolutely enormous bed, flat screen TV and sofa.  The bathroom is worth a special mention for the shower alone - big enough for 4 if you're so inclined! 

The location is great, a few doors from the Opera House and bus station (we caught the bus transfer from the International Airport which took about 30/40 mins and was entirely hassle free), across the road are pubs and restaurants (some well known) which were 100% welcoming.  It's also just a short walk into the shopping areas and we walked up to the Crumlin Road Jail too - which only took 20 mins.  Belfast is pretty compact so basically you're close to almost everything in the city centre.

We ate in the hotel's restaurant (which they plug pretty heavily), the food was yummy but at the more expensive end of the scale. 

The door staff were delightful - while we were there the Business Centre printer was out of order, so we checked-in for our flight home in the lobby, during which the porters offered us lots of info and advice and were swift to organise taxi's, bags etc.  They were genuinely hospitable and seemed to be enjoying their job!

I have no hesitation in recommending this hotel - we had a lovely stay and would use this hotel, or others in the chain, again.",5,2009,11,21
226,"Stay the night, and enjoy!","I stayed for one night with my boyfriend , in their smallest/cheapest (sorry, cant remember name ) choice of room, and we loved it, such a lovely decorated hotel, in a great location.  
the breakfast in the morning was beautiful, and everything thing you need with great service.
This hotel would make me come to stay in belfast again, even though we are only as  hour down the road!
Would  highly recommend.",5,2009,11,19
226,"If Carlsburg did hotels, The Fitzwilliam Hotel would probably be the best in the world!!!","I stayed in The Fitzwilliam for a wkend in november with my boyfriend, and i havent got a bad word to say about it.
The staff were so helpful, the food was amazing, the location is perfectly central, and the rooms are gorgeous!!!
Would highly recommend it tp everyone!",5,2009,11,10
226,Fab hotel,"Stayed overnight in Belfast for a friends 40th. We were staying as a group of friends and just wish we could have stayed longer at this hotel as it was fantastic. The service was super, we were treated like ladies. The rooms were fantastic...spacious and beautifully decorated and the bathrooms were massive with huge separate baths and showers big enough for more than one :-). The bed was the most comfortable I have ever slept in and there was NO noise from either outside or the corridors.  Nice touches in the rooms...candles, cafetieres, bath robes, umbrellas etc. The breakfast was divine. Location super....right next to the Opera House so super for shopping and going out. We travelled by bus so had no car but I don't think carparking is easy (at last I don't see where the car park would be). We didn't have to pay as it was a present so that made it extra special BUT I'm taking my husband to it and it seems that there are good deas if you shop around. Worth the money!",5,2009,11,10
226,Fabulous - the best place to stay in Belfast,"We loved this hotel (and we are not easily pleased!).  The rooms are funky but they work well and are very well equipped with everything you need - including bathrobe/slippers etc.  They are quiet and a good size - most seem to have sofas in them which is a nice touch.   The bed was super-comfortable and the air con worked really well.  The windows opened too which was nice!   We didn't find the corridors at all dark - all the doors are mirrored and so we felt it was quite light.  

Breakfast was excellent with good service and very nice food.    The hotel is also in a great location and right in the heart of things.  We have stayed at a number of different hotels in Belfast but this would be our choice for next time, we were really impressed - keep it up!",5,2009,11,08
226,avoid,very disappointing hotel. small rooms. restaurant v. poor value for money and recommended to eat beforehand..expensive parking. awful views from the rooms. no aftercare service from staff. nothing at all to recommend this hotel. definitely would not stay there again.,1,2009,11,04
226,"very friendly and helpful staff ,rooms too warm ac not working ,expensive parking","My self and my wife spent the Holloween weekend in the Fitzwilliam . We were offered an excellent deal on price . The hotel is centrally located between Jurys and the Europa on the corner of Grosvenor road .The staff were extremely friendly and helpful .the room was bright clean and had a large bathroom and excellent shower . 
An excellent Breakfast and dinner (on one night) was included .The dinner menu was very limited and the extra charge of ¬£3 for veg and ¬£3 for  potatoes was mean . 
The biggest problem was the temperature in the room much too warm and leaving the window open was not an option as the street outside was very noisy",3,2009,11,03
226,"Fantastic, beautiful room, highly recommended","Had a fantastic stay here - admittedly for one night only.The hotel is very stylish with a designer cool lobby and reception area. We had a suite on the eighth floor which was stunning.I think this is the best room we've stayed in so far (im happy to try and better it though!) .The decor and lay out were perfect .Huge,open plan bathroom with touches like lots of large fluffy towels, gorgeous toiletries,double rainshowers and sinks giving a real sense of luxury and space.My only regret is that I didnt have time to make use of the very large free standing,double ended bath.Cleverly designed with a separate large wet room for the showers so everything else didnt get soaked.It did occur to me that the door on the loo - which was another separate room - was only a frosted glass screen, so without getting into details you might not want to be shy or having your first romantic weekend away together!
The bed itself was large and very comfy although my tall boyfriend did find it was rather shorter than a standard king size. 
One wall of the room was floor to ceiling windows looking out over Belfast and the surrounding hills - quite beautiful even though its not the most stunning skyline.A really nice feature as the room was painted black and grey so this meant it felt light and airy.
My only gripe would be the food, I think we may have been unlucky but our room service meal on the first evening was seriously underwhelming-especially as Kevin Thornton has put his name to it.My boyfriends burger was leathery and very small and the hand cut chips were seriously undercooked,a real pity as the menu is much more original than most hotels.
Breakfast was also quite disappointing, while the selection was seriously impressive the food was cold when it arrived (not warm ,cold) although the coffee was delicious and it was served on time.
The bar in the hotel is great, well worth a visit with a good atmosphere and great drinks,the menu is extensive and the staff seem to really know their stuff.
In short a fabulous hotel, well worth the visit and I was sorry we only had the one night and not a lot of time as we were heading to the Odyssey for a show.I would be interested to see what the restaurant is like as room service is often hit and miss but the menu for dinner downstairs looked superb. You do have to pay to park so be warned, but a fantastic luxurious spot with super friendly and attentive staff.",5,2009,11,02
226,"Wow ""Amazing"" most enjoyable stay","Stayed with the two kids over the weekend. 
The staff were kind, service was without fail the best received in Belfast this year. 
We often stay in hotels all round the world and we got an amazing welcome when we arrived and also the Fitzwilliam friendleness was evident during our stay.",5,2009,11,02
226,Oh what a night!,"I am too sleepy to write a big long review but I would thoroughly recommend the Fitzwilliam Hotel to one and all. My wife and I had a WONDERFUL stay in this slick hotel in a 7th floor deluxe corner room with great views of the city.
The staff are top class in all departments and really went out of their way to make our stay as good as it could have been. 
The room was very special and beautifully designed.............and what a view!
The Europa Hotel next door couldn't hold a candle to this place.
We will be back!!",5,2009,10,29
226,Excellent hotel could not fault in any way!,"After a stressful conference in Dublin, my partner treated me to a three night stay at the Fitzwilliam. Refusing to tell me the hotel he had booked until we arrived in Belfast, I was so excited when we rolled up to the doors of the Fitzwilliam  hotel and were greeted immediately by a porter who took our bags up to our rooms. The staff were so welcoming and the personal touches in the room were a rare and pleasant surprise. A  handwritten note on the bedside table for instance, thanking us for staying at the hotel reflected the personal attention that we received throughout our stay. The room was beautiful, almost a suite, with a well stocked bar, immaculate bathroom and CD player (with the offer of borrowing CDs from the concierge). You were even welcome to take books from the lobby library into your room.
A special and belated thanks must be given to the concierge (I forget his name) who made sure that we had dinner arrangements each night. Although we ate at the hotel, which was fabulous, the concierge recommended many restaurants to us within Belfast and there was no sense that they were pushing their own establishment upon us.
If you are looking for luxury, personal attention and good quality service, then I must recommend the Fitzwilliam Hotel.",5,2009,10,28
226,"Cool hotel,great location","Just spent a two-night break at the Fitzwilliam and must say I was very impressed.  The whole feel of the hotel is cool and contemporary, and is in a great location to explore the city. Staff were pleasant and efficient, and the service in the bar and restaurant was very good. Breakfast selection was great, loved the porridge and eggs Benedict. The door banging as the staff went in and out of the kitchen was a bit annoying ...my only quibble...  The bedroom had plenty of space, sofa was handy for dumping all the shopping! Loved the black,white and yellow colour-scheme, and the dark corridoors with the mirrored doors. It all contributed to a feeling of hidden luxury.  Dont forget to book a car space in advance, otherwise you'll have to use a public car park  (like I did!) , the one across the street was very convenient.",4,2009,10,25
226,Simply Gorgeous!,"We stayed here with our parents for their anniversary. We arrived and had no issues with parking. We simply pulled up and the concerige parked our car for us. Check in was very efficent. The hotel has a lovely atmosphere, it's very modern in style, but really elegant and you cannot help but feel special. The rooms were beautiful. I loved the quirky design of mirrors on the outside of the doors, very gothic boudouir! Both rooms were gorgeous. Lovely big beds, massive shower and wonderful toiletries. Even down to the little touches like an umberella in the room, fluffy rodes and slippers, cafetiere and proper coffee, corkscrew, just everything was thought of. We did not eat dinner in the hotel as we had booked a restaurant for the occasion, however we had cocktails in the bar after dinner and they were just sublime - loved the fitzwilliam cosmo's! The bar also had a lovely warm atmosphere, comfy booths to sit in as well. Breakfast the next morning was just so tasty. We all had the full Irish and it was delicious and service was very good. We phoned down prior to check out and the car was waiting at the door. Overall we had a great time and we will definitely be back.",5,2009,10,23
226,Excellent for city centre stay,"stayed in this hotel  at the end of a five  night trip to N. Ireland . overall I would have no problems with the hotel ...    it checked all the boxes ... comfy ....  good service ...  attentive staff ,  city centre location .... however  i felt that the brekkie was a little bit too formal ,  and the  breakfast itself left a little bit to be desired . however it  was the first hotel that  i got coelic bread toasted .   If you are staying in this hotel , the 15 euro to park your car is a must!!!!! .",4,2009,10,16
226,The Hotel night porter Paul made us feel welcome,As we arrived in the hotel the porters showed us to our rooms and was very friendly and asked us our plans. Even though the decor was not to my liking it was very busy but the room was comfortable. We had tickets to the opera that night and we returned to the hotel bar. After a wonderfull evening out to return to paul the night porter really made our night. Paul was very accomadating helping us with queries and always on hand when we needed a drink it was a perfect end to a perfect evening and would like to thank Paul for a night to remember.,5,2009,10,13
226,Marmite - you'll either love it or hate it,"Decor wasn't to my liking - tries very hard to be funky but I just found it a bit gaudy. Corridors are very dark but rooms are bright and clean, bathrooms are large with both a bath and shower - shower was huge but had really poor pressure. Staff are friendly and helpful. Our room faced onto a very busy road and there was a lot of traffic noise. Valet parking was a expensive.",3,2009,10,09
226,Superb Hotel in a Great Location,"Stayed here in Jun 2009 and got a great Deal online. The Hotel is Stunning and the Rooms are tastefully decorated if on the smal side. This Hotel is as advertised a true 5 Star experience. If you are looking to stay in Belfast and can spend a little extra on true Luxury you wont do better than the Fitzwilliam. We had our evening meals in the Bar and the Food, Service and surroundings were excellent. The prices were a little more than you would expect to pay locally but worth every penny. Prking was pricey but in line with what you would expect locally. We would stay here again in a heart beat.",5,2009,10,05
226,really lovely - modern & chic,My friend & I thought we had earned a wee break and decided on the Fitzwilliam as our destination.  And we weren't to be disappointed with our accommodation.  Had read a few other reviews which were very negetative and wondering should we have chosen otherwise - but thankfully not.  The room was lovely and comfortable - beds included!   Asked for room away from elevator but guess what got one right beside them  but not that we noticed we never heard a thing - room was really sound proof.  Great to have tea/coffee making facilities in room.  Ensuite was again lovely and had all the mod cons - great shower also had bath. Breakfast was another enjoyable experience service was very good and restaurant lovely - like everything else - new and modern.  Thoroughly enjoyed our eggs benedict!  Good location for shopping.  Would definitely recommend and stay again - just waiting to be asked!!,5,2009,10,03
226,Disappointment for 5 star hotel,"Stayed here in July 2009 with friends, rooms were very small (as in legs hit off the wall getting out of bed small) and there was alot of noise from the corridors and lifts throughout the night as our room was near the lift shaft, constant 'binging' and mechanics noise as well as voices.

View from our room was straight into another guests room so blinds were required all the time to avoid voyerism. The parking situation is insane, you have to pull up on a high kerb footpath to unload and the car disappears until you require it again, make sure you taken everything you need out when you arrive. There is also an extra charge for parking -location is good but its not bang in the city centre to justify no parking.

Restaurant was fantastic but pricey. Good location, excellent service but rooms too small and build quality poor due to inadequate sound proofing.

Emailed hotel to express my concerns but no reply shows lack of interest in customers experiences",2,2009,09,29
226,great location and lovely hotel - deals to be had too!,"The hotel location is excellent and withing a 15 minute walk of most of Belfast. We used this as a base and walked to the city centre, botanic gardens and falls road areas easily. The hotel was excellent and we had a deluxe corner room with double aspect glass walls overlooking the city. Whilst they failed to clean the room one day this was very quickly rectified when mentioned to them. The breakfast was lovely with great choice and good service. I guess for many the ¬£19 for full breakfast seems steep and it would be. I called the hotel to book directly and used the rate offered by Expedia (one night free) as a basis and they threw in breakfast for ¬£20 for both of us for the three days of the stay.... so a good deal i reckon.",5,2009,09,29
226,Great hotel and a great location in the heart of the city,"My husband and I have just returned from a stay at The Fitzwilliam for our wedding anniversary. We travel a lot, like quality hotels and always do a lot of research on our hotel beforehand. This hotel is undoubtedly the best and most luxurious we have ever stayed at. 
However, where the hotel really excels is in the service and attention to detail. The staff were extremely friendly, helpful and professional.The concerge Fergal recomended we take the black taxi tour and our guide Bobby was brilliant .
The specification in the rooms was high- no corners were cut . Lunch in the hotel bar was delicious also.
It's sadly common to feel shortchanged when you splash out on a pricey hotel but this really was good value and absolutely worth every penny.
We feel blissed out after our stay and can't wait to return. When we next visit Belfast",5,2009,09,28
226,A COMPLETE LET DOWN,I stayed for two nights on businss.  Reception resembles a three star not five.  Corridors too dark.  Charge for every possible extra.  Hotel charged extra to credit card for their own chosen charity without asking permission from me until I queried the charge.  Hotel staff explained they have leaflets throughout hotel explaining this will happen - I saw no such information anywhere in hotel during my stay. Guest should be entitled to choose their own charity in their own time .  Parking is a rip off at 15stg per day on top of overcharged accomodation. As a result I would never stay at a Fitzwilliam hotel again for business or pleasure.,3,2009,09,28
226,"For a special occasion, book a suite at this hotel - fabulous","My husband booked this hotel as a 30th birthday surprise. He booked a suite room and it was just fabulous!! 
AS soon as we arrived at this hotel we felt very special. The service and staff were excellent. We live in Belfast and have travelled extensively, however I can honestly say this is one of the best hotels we have ever stayed in...and it's right on our doorstep. Loved it. It has a romantic feel in its surroundings for couples.",5,2009,09,27
226,Fantastic Holiday Relaxation,"I recently spent a week at the Fitzwilliam and have nothing but good to report.  I arrived at about 10:30 AM, just after a transatlantic flight and expected to wait until the 2P check-in time to get into my room.  I was wrong!  I no sooner walked into the lobby than the concierge took my bags, got me checked in at the front desk and delivered me to my room.  What a pleasant surprise!  And then the room - comfy bed with a thick duvet, lots of pillows, mood candles, and even a flower in a vase on the side table!  I actually thought it was one of those fake flowers with clear plastic made to look like the water, but not so.  The bath was luxurious with a big soaking tub and a walk in shower, even a cozy terry robe to wrap up in.  The staff was very friendly and helpful, I could get spoiled here.  I also had dinner in the Menu by Kevin Thornton (restaurant in the hotel) and it goes down in my book as one of the top 2 restaurant dinners ever. I took my waiter's dinner suggestion and had an absolutely amazing meal!  Location?  Easily within walking distance of most anything you'd like to do, and if you need a taxi they will have one there in 5 minutes.  Next time I go to Belfast I won't have to go looking for a hotel - I already know where the best in town is!",5,2009,09,16
226,Very nice relaxing stay,"I liked the Fitzwilliam.  Really convenient for shopping etc. Our room was nice, very modern (it might date quite quickly) and comfortable.  Nice shampoo etc & good shower.  Well stocked mini bar.  Brolly was a nice touch.  Breakfast was good.  Really only slight disappointment was our room service - the caesar salad wasn't nice, nor were the crabcakes.",4,2009,09,09
226,Excellent Hotel For Couples,"I was reading the ""Terrible"" reviews about this hotel and I couldn't disagree more with the ""Dissapointing"" one. Rooms are fairly big and our bed was the most comfortable I have slept in many hotels. Service was great too, though I must admit it's quite expensive (I had a shot of rum nearly twice as expensive as in any sophisticated bar in town). We had breakfast in the room and the presentation was spotless. Also, it was on time and most importantly: it was delicious! I have to give credit about the heating control, it was quite warm at some point but eventually you can regulate it. If someone ever has a bad stay here is because they expect rooms to be the size of a hippodrome, or just that you're in a bad mood during your stay.

About the second ""Terrible"" review: She's quite right about location and inaccesibilty. But let's be honest: This hotel is made for couples :-).

Excellent place, I totally recommend it!",5,2009,09,09
226,"If you are going to Belfast, stay at the Fitzwilliam!!","We recently stayed at the Fitzwilliam in Belfast.  It was a wonderful stay.  The room was beautiful, the food was excellent and the service was exemplary.  The location is really great, near bars, restaurants, entertainment and shopping.  What a great hotel!",5,2009,09,04
226,"Great Location, Good Service, Dirty Hotel","This hotel advertises itself as a five star but falls somewhere short - I'm not saying it's a poor hotel but it's certainly the worst five star I've stayed in. Staff were friendly but rooms were never made up until last in the afternoon and even then were poorly cleaned - it was an effort to get extra towels.
On the plus side, it's location is great and the staff were friendly - Overall it was not worth the money to stay there.",2,2009,09,02
226,Disappointing,"Was looking forward to my 2 night stay in this hotel after reading the reviews, however I was very dissappointed. The foyer was a let down for a 5 star hotel, the halls were ridiculously dark and the room, although nicely decorated, was very small. The bed was the most uncomfortable bed I had ever slept in and on the first night I slept only 3 hours due to the heat in the room and the hospital-like bed. I phoned down to reception twice only for them not to answer or call back. No turn down service offered or received on first night. I also found the staff dismissive to the point of verging on rude. 
Will not stay again if I wish to have a relaxing stay.",1,2009,09,01
226,Classy,"Stayed for 1 night (Saturday) with my wife. The hotel is very well located - just a couple of minutes from the main shopping area. The foyer is not very impressive for a 5-star - quite compact and under stated. The bar is modern and quite clean. I booked valet parking (cost ¬£15 per day) - it's a convenient service and the attendant was very efficient in taking the car and bringing it around on checkout.

We got the standard room and this was certainly big enough for the 2 of us. The view was of a carpark but we didn't mind. The room was very tastefully decorated. Most of the furniture and fittings was of an exceptionally high quality (with the exception of the writing desk which for some reason was a little flimsy)

There is a fully stocked minibar, haridryer, ironing board+iron, writing paper, lcd tv. There were extra pillows and tea making facilities (including milk) and free bottle of water on arrival.

We booked dinner in the hotel as it has a michelan star. The dinner was excellent and not outrageously expensive. The restaurant is on the first floor and it is (again) modern and very tastefully decorated. The waiting staff were very attentive. The presentation of the food was first class and portions were on the smaller side (which is the way I like it when out for a few drinks also). I had code and it was cooked to perfection. My wifes beef (stew) was less impressive but still very nice. The starters and deserts were top notch - overall well worth dining there. One issue I had was that the fire alarm went off a couple of times. This was annoying and we played it down when the poor waiters rushed around apolgising and explaining why it was happening. But a 5-star establishment should've offered a free drink and I'm taking a star off the rating for this. But this is a management issue - the staff were excellent and we tipped on that basis.

Belfast is quite a small city and there's not a huge amount to do so if you're staying in Ireland I couldn't recommend anymore than one (possibly two at most) nights in the area. The bus tour is very interesting (¬£12.50) as it goes through some of the sectarian 'hot spots' (Shankhill Road & Falls Road). You can still see the 'peace line' fences that divide the communities. Also, the bus goes into the grounds of the very picturesque 'Stormont' and along the port with the famous Haarland & Wolfe cranes. There is also a Titanic tour available but we didn't go on that. On the bus tour we passed by Queens University which looked very beautiful and probably worth a visit if you had the time.

We also went to see a concert in the Odyssey Arena - acoustics were excellent - very good venue for a concert. The hotel were very efficient in booking a taxi to take us out and the draught beer in hotel bar on the way back was very good.

There are quite a few large shops in the town center - sterling is quite weak (as of writing) so it could be worth doing some shopping while you're there.",4,2009,08,24

Parking at ¬£15 not good and as far as I could see not on web!!",5,2009,08,11
226,Perfect 5* hotel at 3* price,"We stayed for one night, but it felt like a week. Hotel is beautiful, very modern design. Room was huge with en suite with bath and large shower and the toiletries were fab. Staff were so friendly and genuine. Philip the wonder concierge booked a fabulous restaurant for dinner (James Street South) and organised a taxi for us. Our car was taken from us when we arrived and we didnt need to take it back as we checked out, there was no problem leaving it parked until later in the day.

The reception area has a small library of books which are fantastic to browse through over a drink and the bar is very cool and food was perfect. I honestly couldnt recoemmend it any more.  Oh and irs right beside the Opera house so perfect if you were going to a show.",5,2009,08,10
226,fantastic hotel with food to match,"We stayed for the weekend. It was our first trip to Belfast and we were not dissappointed. My husband is coeliac and the staff did eveything to ensure he was able to eat safely. The rooms are a good size. The bathrooms are very luxurious. Position is a block from main bus station and a block from city hall. The open top tour bus stops across the road, so its all on the doorstep. It rained so the hotel gave us a brolly for the day, arranged transport at the drop of a hat. Truly a joy to stay there.
The restaurant is very reasonable and the chef is Michelin starred. Good irish cooking no faffy stuff. good portion sizes and good choice.
Will go back again.",5,2009,08,10
226,One of the best hotels i've stayed in!!! EVER!,"I travel quite a lot and have been lucky enough to stay in many 5 star hotels around the world! id rank this hotel top of the list! 
Check out was so fast! Girl on the desk was very friendly and so helpful, I got Valet Parking ¬£15 per night - the mccauseland car park across the street is ¬£11 per night but id prefer my car to be on site! 
I stayed in a Deluxe king room booked through the hotel ¬£155 for 1 night! the room was gorgeous with a corner view overlooking the city and Divis mountain, and it really wasnt that noisy for being right in the heart of belfast!
id deffinately recommend this hotel to anyone it was fantastic, bed was really comfy too! ive not one complaint!!! LOVED IT!",5,2009,08,08
226,Great Location,"Stayed in this hotel on a two night dinner B&B rate.  The staff were very friendly.  The girls on reception were very helpful.   On check out, we enquired about the Black Taxi Tour, and after deciding to do the tour, the concierge had a Black Taxi outside waiting for us within 10 minutes (very well worth it).  We had a great night in Robinsons pub across the road where there was live music playing.  However the hotel was extremely quiet, with very few other residents",4,2009,08,07
226,Service second to none,"Stayed here for 2 nights the August bank holiday weekend as I was going to the UTV country music fest. Had been to Belfast before and stayed elsewhere and after staying at the Fitzwilliam will never stay at another hotel in Belfast. The rooms were spotless and luxurious and the bed you would die in its that comfortable.

Had room service on both nights quite late and the staff were more than happy to attend to us with a smile. Reception staff were so friendly and helpful I asked for directions and one of the girls printed me a map.

The valet parking was an added expense but our bags were carried in and out to the car and I forgot something and the valet got it and delivered to our room. The design of the bar is beautiful and the halways are fabulous too.

All in all its 5 star all round and worth every penny we spent!!!",5,2009,08,04
226,Beuitful Hotel but be warned very expnsive,"Stayed here for my birthday for 2 nights on the 1st and 2 of August.Hotel very easy to find read a lot about parking but we just parked on the footpath which is very wide and unloaded our car.Here is my opions on the hotel some good point and some negative points.

Car Park:We did not book out car in the carpark so it was full parked accross the road which was ¬£11 for the day.The Hotel car park turned out to be ¬£15 for the day as we moved it for the sunday.So i would use either again i thought the hotel car park was very expensive as you are already paying for the room.

Rooms:These were very very nice with everything you could want in them.If you are a light sleeper the church bell might annoy you in the morning as it rings every 15 mins.Also found that the A/C could have worked a little bit better but then i like my bedroom very very cold.Bathroom was lovely shower everything was great.On the satuday night that we stayed there was a turn down service and towels ect changed but they turned off the A/C in our room.No turn down service on the sunday night or change of towles,if they are going to do this they should do it very night and not just the oone night.For a 5 star hotel this should be done every night.Stay away form the bar in the bedrom a can of diet coke was ¬£3.50 and a btl of beer  ¬£4.50.

Food:olny ate brekfast there as we were olny room olny the brekfast was ¬£15.00 for continental and ¬£19 for full irish this was a bit expensive i do not mind paying if things are nice but to me this is a rip off. so olny had brekfast one night did not eat dinner there as i am sure it would have been more expensive.

Staff were very helpful and could not do ennough for you.

the bar was very nice but the drink was expensive but then that was the way it is in belfast and you get a smaller btl than we get in southeren Ireland.

We also did the Black taxi tour which was very nice and would recommen that you do it.

We ate in 2 restraunt Tony Roma and Villia Itialia both were very nice and a good price.

Overall i  enjoyed my stay and would go back again.On thing the Fitzwilliam is a member if the I Prefer club but when i handed in my card at check in they did not know anything about it.As a member we were entilited a tour of the city but did not rescive it also we were entililited to a free upgrade but did not rescive it i know that it was not availaible on the sat night but we were not offered it on the sunday.Hotel should not have these offers if they do not know about them in the hotel.",5,2009,08,04
226,you will not be disappointed!!!,"everything about this hotel is magnificent. very centrally situated the delights of belfast are on your doorstep. the hotel truly deserves its 5* rating. from the moment we arrived the staff were more than accomodating. the room was very spacious and the bed was very very comfortable. the hotel bar was very modern and a pleasure to drink in. my wife and i did not eat in the hotel, choosng instead to sample a restaurant in town. i phoned reception who telephoned a taxi for us and it was waiting outside the hotel to take us to our restaurant. whether your stay is for one night or more, you will definitely not be disappointed with the fitzwilliam hotel - i will definitely be booking again",5,2009,07,26
226,One of the nicest hotels ever visited,"I would throughly recommend the Fitzwilliam if visiting Belfast. Their own website seems to be the best place to book - ¬£148 DBB excellent value. The decor is very modern and very cool while being extremely comfortable. The food is top quality. But what really makes this hotel stand out is the genuine friendliness of the staff.
If I could change anything about  our stay in the Fitzwilliam it would be that we could have opened the window in our bedroom - constant airconditioning is not good for anyone - but the architect doesn't seem to have taken this into consideration which is a great pity in what is otherwise an almost perfect place to stay in Belfast.",5,2009,07,25
226,Magnificent!,"I just returned from 2 nights in the Fitzwilliam Hotel and wow this hotel is very impressive.

ROOMS:

The rooms have a lovely design with up-to-date features like lcd tv, very comfortable bed & lovely sunken bath and huge shower.  The colour scheme in the rooms of black and gold is beautiful.

SERVICE:

The hotel really excels in this area.  Reception staff, conceirge are all very welcoming, friendly and will do anything to make your stay more pleasant.  Little touches like staff remembering your name, room number is lovely to see.  

HOTEL BAR:

I don't usually go on about hotel bars as they are usually boring but the Fitzwilliam had a great atmosphere, great food and not a rip off.  I really recommend weither you stay in the hotel or are in belfast to check it out and enjoy it.  The residents bar doesn't close so technically you can have drinks at any hour of the day/night!

LOCATION:

Great location right beside the Opera House, only 2 mins walk from City Hall and 5 mins from the shopping district and importantly all the tour buses go from Jurys Inn next door so very handy.

THINGS TO SEE/DO:

I highly recommend the Black cab tours you can take around belfast.  Absolutely brilliant.  Our driver Nigel was soo enthuasiastic, helpful and brought us around for 4 and a half hours with tons of local knowledge.  Very very insightful and one of the highlights of the trip!  He even recommended a couple of great restaurants and pubs to visit!

OVERALL:

Brilliant hotel, lovely city and great value!!!!",5,2009,07,22
226,"""Very Nice""","We decided to spend a night in Belfast after returning from a weeks sun hoilday in portugal, based on the great reviews we decided to try the Fitzwilliam,the hotel is in a good location , about 10 mins from Victoria and Oxford st, the main shopping areas.The hotel itself is furnished very tastefully , rooms are of a decent size , and most if not all are in lime green colors,rooms have mini-bars,flat screen t.v and mini hifi. The Hotel bar is small but the coctails are well worth a look.The staff were friendly and helpfull.I would definitely recommend this hotel.",5,2009,07,21
226,trying hard -- and succeeding!,"As -- seemingly -- the ""new guy"" in town, this hotel is trying very hard -- and succeeding on all counts. Everything -- our room, breakfast, the staff -- could not have been better. And the location is convenient as well. This is a first-class hotel in what is -- possibly -- not a first-class city... but the city is also trying very hard -- despite various problems...",5,2009,07,15

226,Belfast New Chic,"Got a great deal on this hotel through Travel Supermarket. Cheaper than the grotty Holiday Inn nearby. I love the style of this hotel. Bang up to date, and a level of furnishings in the public area which really marks this out as different from everything else in the city. All the others seem faded and dated compared to the Fitzwilliam. The staff I met were professional and friendly. A good experience. A few things do need to be sorted by the management.. Firstly the water pressure in the shower is low, even when turned up to full. I am sure this can be put right with ease. Secondly, when the staff are going round picking up room service breakfast orders, and leaving news papers at 05.00 in the morning, please do it quietly. I was wakened by numerous doors banging as they went round. Not great as it spoils a near perfect experience in a hotel I hope does well.",5,2009,06,24
226,Tasteful and elegant,"Had a one night stay at this hotel. On arrival, found the reception staff very friendly and the valet parking very useful. The room was reasonably large and beautifully decorated. It had all we could have needed. The bathroom was exceptionally well designed. The lighting in the room - including tea lights - and the fresh orchids added to the ambiance in the room.

The location of this hotel couldn't have been better to experience Belfast.

Had a fab stay at the Fitzwilliam Belfast",5,2009,06,22
226,Understated Elegance,"Have just returned from a 2 night stay at the Fitzwilliam Belfast.  The hotel is located in a very central part of town, right beside the Opera House, just down the road from the famous Crown Bar and a short walk from City Hall and the main shopping areas. After reading previous reviews we were really looking forward to staying at the hotel, and were prepared for the drop off and parking facilities at the hotel.  We had booked a two night bed and breakfast and one dinner package directly with the hotel and had also booked a spot in the car park with valet parking.  We had no issue with arrival at the hotel and parked on the very wide pavement outside the front door of the hotel, unloaded our bags and handed our keys to the very friendly Concierge who took the car to a nearby carpark. The lobby of the hotel is  nicely decorated, modern and understated, but with fantastic attention to detail.  The more time you spent in it the more you notice, everything is very subtle. There are lovely couches and chairs to relax in and plenty of reading material available.  There are two lifts from the lobby to the rooms and they are very fast, you are never waiting very long for one.  Our room was very nice, exactly as pictured on the hotel website.   Modern furnishings and again fantastic attention to detail and  very subtle luxurious touches, such as two beautiful fresh flowers, floating in a glass on coffee tables at either side of the sofa in the room.  Very trendy VOSS mineral water left at the bedside.  There was a built in area at the side of the bed that contained the mini-bar, tea and coffee making facilities (a cafetiere for fresh coffee)  and a CD player and speakers. Guests can chose to borrow CD's from the hotels collection.  The bathroom was fabulous and contained a large bath and a huge shower.  The toiletries available were also of a very high quality.  There was as bathrobe and slippers for both of us.  There was also a Fitzwilliam umbrella in the room for us to use while we stayed ...this was a nice touch and we were glad of it!  Breakfast (which is served until 11.30 in the morning )was fantastic.  A lovely selection of cereals, fresh fruit, breads, croissants and a choice of  cooked  breakfasts.  We opted for the traditional fry both mornings and it was truly delicious, but you could chose from a large menu of items that included Eggs Benedict, pancakes and fresh strawberries etc. The staff in the restaurant were so professional and very friendly.  We explored all that Belfast has to offer during the afternoon, and while out called the hotel to make our dinner reservation for that evening, and this was one of only two issues that I would have with the hotel and why they only recieved four out of five for service.  The person on the phone was very offhand, and even though we explained that we were guests in the hotel, on a b&B and dinner package, they were very unaccommodating about making a reservation in the restaurant as they said they were very busy that night.  Eventually when we insisted that they had to sort something out...they managed to make a table booking for us.  This was I felt very bad service from a  hotel, it has always been my experience that hotel restaurants always have a number of tables in reserve for hotel guests.  This should not have been an issue particularly as we were on a dinner package!  Anyway, we had  our dinner there that evening and it was quite good,  The menu and name of the restaurant is attributed to Kevin Thornton so with this the expectation is that the food would be excellent and to  be fair certain aspects of it were, but my partners porcini risotto starter left a lot to be desired, lacking in flavour and very gloopy.  The portion sizes of the fillet steaks were also on the small side. However, the steak was cooked to perfection.  Again in the restaurant, there was obvious attention to detail with the presentation of the food.  The restaurant staff were excellent.  

On our last morning, before we headed down for breakfast  I rang reception to request a slightly late checkout (according to their blurb in the room they will always try to accommodate this where possible!), we were having breakfast at 11.15 and I hoped to extend checkout till about 1230-1245 so that we wouldn't have to rush it.  This is my second gripe about the service in the hotel, when I rang reception and made the request, the receptionist was very rude and abrupt.  She reluctantly allowed me a 1230 checkout but ""absolutley not any longer""and made me feel that she was doing me a huge favour by granting this concession, I thanked her and said that this would be perfect for us, but her attitude left me with a very bad impression of her poor customer relation skills.  There are nice ways to say no to someone, and as a person who stays in hotels regularly  I totally appreciate that late checkouts are not always possible....but it's all in the way you say it!  The staff in the restaurant, bar and concierge desk were truly excellent and my disappointing encounter was on two occasions with the reception staff by telephone which is why I can only give four stars for service.  Overall the hotel is very very nice and I would certainly stay there again, if you like modern five star hotels then this is worth a stay.  It's very nice, comfortable, relaxed,trendy and ideally situated in central Belfast.",4,2009,06,21
226,"Well-decorated ,Good staff but the room's view !","1- The hotel was the same price of Euorpa hotel but I wanted to get a 5 stars one ,So I booked it as they were in the same range of price but I regretted it because Europe had a very out-standing view over Victoria square and Fitzwilliam has an aisle view!!!

2- The room and the toilet were well decorated and beautiful even the lobby was nice although it was quite small but looked cozy except for the entrance which was so 3 stars hotel like , I mean as 5 luxurious hotel, i expected the entrance to be gigantic instead, it was like a small shop entrance.

3- The staff were so polite and helpful.I called the reception at midnight to ask for something to eat, they did not ask me to call the room service instead they brought me a super-delicious sandwich!! by the way I so liked the staff uniform , very Elegant!!

4- The location was perfect ,did not need a car or even bus except when I went to Odessy arena and the airport..

5- I probably would try the other twin hotel in Dublin If and only if it has a great view over the street not an aisle...",5,2009,06,21
226,"Beautiful hotel, nicest staff","Everything about this place is brand new (only open about 3 months), smartly designed, and pleasing to the senses.  We were the first people to ever use our room! Much larger than we expected, certainly by European standards. King bed was truly king size. Can't say enough about how perfectly they balanced good taste and a modern/futuristic design scheme. 
Their conference rooms looked beyond state-of-the-art. Would love to attend a professional/business meeting there.
Everyone who works there is a gem. All arrangements made by internet were faithfully carried out. Nothing is too much trouble for the staff.
Restaurant, bar, and breakfast were superb, at amazingly low prices for what I'm accustomed to paying in a European capital. Food was so fresh and delicious, presented and served so well, and the atmosphere was the best.
Location perfect. Short walk from Europa Bus Station and Great Victoria Train Station. All tour buses and taxis are across the street. Very friendly drivers and tour guides waiting to take you, and the prices are quite reasonable. Wonderful historic pubs just a block up the street.
Business center is a nice touch- 3 free computers, free internet, free printer.
Prices everywhere are a lot cheaper than London or Dublin. They seem desperate for American tourists. The people of Belfast are the nicest you'd ever want to meet!
Noteworthy- the city seems to close down early. By 6pm most stores are closed. Tour buses stop going out at 4:30pm. Hard to get a meal anywhere without a reservation after 9pm, unless you eat at the hotel. It was daylight until about 10:30pm! Weather was perfect- a shower each day, high temp about 60 degrees. Have a rain jacket with a hood, and you'll be fine.
It's very safe in the city. We intentionally avoided the margins of the city where the haters/troublemakers of both sides still seem entrenched.",5,2009,06,21
226,Nothing Special,I stayed for just one night with my sister and my 15month old son. I found the room to be very small. It had everything you could want but for a new hotel it just isn't anything special. There is a lot of noise coming up from the street below. Breakfast was excellent. Bar area nice but it was difficult to get a space as it isn't that big. There is no space outside the hotel to pull up and unload and as we arrived at rush hour we had a number of cars blow at us because we were blocking traffic... Maybe we're spoilt but I really feel for a new hotel the Fitzwilliam is just not delivering..,2,2009,06,20
226,fab fitzwilliam,"we booked this last minute and got a special weekend break rate including an evening meal on the hotel's website.
Really loved the whole experience-staff were without exception really professional friendly and efficent.
The room was a standard but was beautifully decorated.
We had a few drinks in the lovely bar on the friday evening-fantastic cocktails and lovely atmosphere.
The lobby area is very impressive -you can sit and read the books on display or just chill out.
Breakfasts were fab-great choices and service but the best bit was the fantastic meal.
The food was wonderful and the service again excellent-will definetly be returning.

Loved everything about this stylish hotel-great Belfast location too.Drinks are a bit pricey but as a treat now and again definetly worth it.",5,2009,06,14
226,Loved The Fitzwilliam!,"Stayed at the Fitzwilliam for one night and wish it could have been longer.  The staff was more than friendly - Mark (who appeared to be the manager) sat down with us for nearly an hour and helped map out our trip around Ireland!  The rooms were comfortable, stylish, quiet, and clean.   Although parking was a bit confusing at first, Fergus (the accommodating and very friendly concierge) quickly appeared to take our car to a nearby parking garage.  Great location in the center of town.  Belfast is a great place - if you are a tourist make sure to book a Black Cab Tour of the city.  We will definitely be back!",5,2009,06,07
226,relaxed luxury and excellent service make this a very special hotel,we wanted to treat ourselves and be well looked after for a night and this hotel certainly delivered. having pulled up to the door we had the car taken care of straight away by valet parking and were met by very friendly reception staff who made us feel warmly welcomed. The space and light of the foyer contrast beautifully with the slightly dark and daring feel of the bar and the contemporary decor throughout left us with high expectations for our room. we were certainly not disappointed. the bedroom was pure luxury from the bedding to the bath and we had everthing from books to browse through to champagne in the mini bar. heaven! we spent most of evening in the hotel enjoying excellent food in the restaurant and great cocktails in the bar. all the staff were very friendly and seemed to take real pride in providing the best of service. Breakfast at eleven the next morning was a real treat with a great choice of both healthy and indulgent options which finished off one of the most relaxing and enjoyable stays we have ever had. our next stay is already booked!,5,2009,06,06
226,SUPERB STYLISH ....... The best Belfast has to offer..,"I stayed with my wife for the second time recently and had yet another fantastic experience. The room decor lemon/black was refreshing, and the newness of everything was to be enjoyed. Unfortunately the other hotels like the Europa and Culloden are in some serious need of a major revamp so its refreshing to see a bright new one arrive in town. 
Dont dare think about eating out. The restaurant in the hotel is fabulous and not at all expensive compared to whats out there. If you dont want to eat in two nights in a row then the Cayenne restaurant (Paul Rankin's) is a very easy walk 5mins up the street. Sun-Thurs ¬£20 and ¬£25 3 course set menus. But watch the wine prices they can bite!! avg ¬£30+/btl
There was not one negative to report.on with the Fitzwilliam. Only one comment that we booked a suite for the first visit and an exec. for our return. The extra space in the suite seemed to be in the bathroom which is nice, but we found the exec. room more than adequate. Well done to staff and management. A pleasurable experience..... and we will return again and again..",5,2009,06,02
226,Fantastic - a hotel Belfast can be proud of,"My girlfriend and I stayed at The Fitzwilliam for 2 nights in May and thoroughly enjoyed our break. Before booking here we considered staying at The Merchant Hotel but in the end we found the Fitzwilliam Hotel excelled in terms of it's location, the deal they offered us and their overall efficiency in responding to our emails. 

After a friendly genuine welcome from the young but professional reception team we were allowed to check-in to our room early. The room was exactly as that portrayed on their website with the black and lime green colour scheme working surprisingly well, especially in the evening with the curtains drawn and lights turned on - very cosy and elegant. The room was spacious and comfortable with a separate seating area. The bathroom was also spacious with separate bath and rainshower although this seemed to have just the one setting which could have been more powerful for my liking. It would have been nice to be able to have music piped from the tv radio into the bathroom as we have experienced in other 5 star hotels. Our room was on the fifth floor on the side directly overlooking bedrooms in the Jury's Hotel, a stone's throw away, opposite but this did not bother us too much as we were out and about most of the the day. It was the little touches like umbrellas, highest quality toiletries, free newspaper delivered daily, and a great Concierge service that really sets this hotel apart from the competition.

The breakfast delivered to our room was the highlight of our stay for me - it was the best hotel breakfast I have ever had. The quality of each ingredient in the traditional Irish cooked breakfast  was the best available, particularly the black and white puddings which just melted in the mouth. The breakfast in the hotel restaurant the next morning was just as good however we found the breakfast room/restaurant a little too modern, clinical and cold for our tastes, as was the entrance and reception area.

We had a couple of minor complaints about the housekeeping, namely the room not being serviced until late afternoon, despite us being out all day or not giving the room a turn-down on one night but overall we were extremely happy with The Fitzwilliam Hotel and definitel recommend it.",5,2009,06,01
226,Love this place!,"Stayed only for one night, but wished I were going to be there for more. I think it is brand new, and has only opened recently, so at the moment, they are offering great deals. Even if not, it's worth staying here! The design is very contemporary, appealing and well done (and I am usually one to prefer traditional to trendy); the lobby is an inviting place to hang around for a bit; and every member of the staff that I interacted with was really outstanding. The room was quite nice - not huge, but a nice size with a nice layout - and the bathroom with its dramatic balck and white tile was very cool (great shower!). I think most rooms that face the front would have a great view; ours was rather terrible -- we looked into rooms across from ours, and out onto the roof with the heating & cooling works. Be sure to ask for rooms on the front - I'm sure they'll accommodate you if they can. Now here is the one bad thing: unless you know to pull your car up onto the sidewalk and let them valet it, you will have a terrible time with unloading and/or parking. The hotel is on a very busy street and there is nowhere a place to pull up with you unload. This was very frustrating, and there's no way you'd know what to do just from passing by. So consider yourself warned on that, and enjoy the rest!",5,2009,05,31
226,Belfast Brilliance,"Everything about this hotel was fantastic. The staff was friendly, helpful and efficient. The rooms were lavish and sooo aesthetically pleasing. The location was as central as it gets and there was none of the obnoxious 'pay as you go' policies that so many hotels and airlines operate these days. Breakfast and minibar were extras (and the breakfast was fantastic!) but everything else was included: wifi, hifi (cd's could be borrowed at the reception) bottled water, newspapers delivered to the room, gym, complimentary nuts when buying drinks in the bar. There were bathrobes and slippers and umbrellas which could be used throughout the stay (and bought at departure if wanted). The experience we got from staying in this hotel was luxurious from beginning to end and we cant recommend it highly enough!",5,2009,05,26

226,Great Stay in belfast,I Stayed in the Fitzwilliam hotel over Easter with my Husband and 2 Children... I can't say enough about the place... The hotel is so central it was walking distances to everything. The staff were very friendly and helpful.... Including the housekeeping... who I asked to lay a Easter egg hunt in the room for me...  when we went down for breakfast. The food is excellent and have a great kids menu but there was no problem in asking for special requests from the Children!!!!!!! Room were big and spacious. We requested ajoining rooms which they had available. All in all can't wait to go back.,5,2009,04,21
226,Top class post theatre venue,"My wife and I stayed at this hotel on a thursday evening after a show in the adjacent Grand Opera House for which its ideal being but a matter of a few steps away. Perfect to retire to for a post show drink before bed and have the pleasure of mingling with the theatre cast. 
The service was excellent and although there was a minor glitch with the reservation it was corrected immediately and a discount given by way of apology. 
The entire decor is pleasing, makes an ultra modern statement, and is carried throughout the hotel. We had chosen to dine in the Opera House's own Hippodrome Restaurant (which I highly recommend) so I can only comment on breakfast which was excellent as was the service.
I understand all rooms face the street, ours did giving great views over the city and only the slightest rumble of traffic noise. A very comfortable bed and one of the best night's sleep we've had.
The downtown location does mean that there is no parking adjacent however there is ample parking at reasonable overnight cost in the nearby multi storey or by ringing ahead the hotel will park your car for a small fee or best of all leave the car at home and use bus or taxi.",5,2009,04,18
226,Great,"A gem of a hotel, modern,central, stylish. Loved it and the staff where just wonderful, friendly without being obtrusive. Great decor, modern but still felt like a living room, books open fire, lit candles.. And the food, well it's Kevin Thorntan so it's better than good. The studio rooms are a piece fo Asia in the heart of Belfast city.
Great location for a weekend away and you romantic types would be happy too!",5,2009,04,06
226,Great Beds,Stayed at the fitzwilliam for 2 nights on its third week the good points were the beds best i have ever slept in. The shower and the bath room were great and the room was very nice. As it was my first time in the north bit a culture shock as no RTE channels and hard to get southern papers. The parking and the breckfast were the negitives about the hotel ¬£15 per night for parking and you also had to park on the double yellow lines to get your bags out of the car not sure how they got plaining for hotel with out  a set down area. Breakfast was nice but i have had better and cheaper ¬£19  for full Irish. Not worth that price. Resturant was very nice and the bar ok not my style thry the bars a cross the road.,4,2009,04,01
226,Excellent location and some flaws,"Here is a hotel with some personality and class in the center of Belfast. Certainly functional and comfortable, this hotel has a good quality of service and an essential but elegant environment, a typical high-level urban hotel, but not exactly deserving of 5 stars. The rooms are beautiful and also functional but not very large, the bathrooms are a little more spacious. The restaurant where breakfast is served is pleasant, but the breakfast itself could be a little more refined and varied in terms of buffet while more options are provided with an a la carte menu which however implies slightly longer timings than normal . The very small gym, practically located in a room, leaves something to be desired. However, the valet parking service is highly appreciated (although expensive), very useful in the centre. As I reported to the Management, the request of 10 pounds in case of request for 1 hour late check out, among other things for guests staying for multiple nights, is completely incomprehensible considering the standard of the hotel. It is not a question of additional cost, considering the non-trivial cost of the accommodation, but only of principle which makes the structure expire for a trifle and consolidates the perception of not being faced with a five star hotel.",4,2024,06,18
226,Belfast Warm and Very Cozy,"We were in Belfast for a few days and we had excellent attention and the service of all the staff at the hotel was first class, the restaurant has exquisite food, the 100% family atmosphere and the help at all times both in ordering taxis, offering us help for tours, and bottles of water, directions to the city, or if it rains, have umbrellas ready. Thank you very much!!!",5,2024,05,23

226,Excelente hotel y muy buena ubicaci√≥n.,"Llegamos un poco cansados del viaje y nos recibieron excelente, la atenci√≥n del personal siempre fue la mejor, los cuartos muy agradables aunque les falta una actualizaci√≥n para dejarlos m√°s modernos y con m√°s comodidades. En general todo excelente! 
Totalmente recomendable!",5,2018,12,17
226,Super f√ºr ein Wochenende,"Das Hotel liegt mitten in der Stadt, also bestens geeignet f√ºr einen Wochenend-Trip. Die Zimmer sind hochwertig, der Service ist sehr nett, eine tolle Hotelbar. Hier passt alles. Es ist nicht gerade g√ºnstig, aber wenn ich mir die anderen Hotels in Belfast ansehe, d√ºrfte der Preis sich im Rahmen halten.",4,2018,10,28
226,Sch√∂nes Hotel in top Lage,"Das Hotel befindet sich zentral in Belfast, sodass alle Sehensw√ºrdigkeiten gut zu Fu√ü zu erreichen sind. Busse von und nach Dublin ins Zentrum oder zum Flughafen halten nur wenige Meter vom Hotel entfernt.

Wir hatten hier einen sch√∂nen Aufenthalt.",5,2018,10,07
226,Ad un cinque stelle si richiede di pi√π ,"Siamo stati recentemente a Belfast per visitare la citt√† e in particolare il museo del Titanic, cos√¨ abbiamo scelto di soggiornare in questo hotel, che √® molto vicino alla bus station e ai siti di maggior interesse. La camera, bench√© piccola, era abbastanza confortevole e silenziosa, anche se ad un hotel cinque stelle si richiederebbe un'attenzione maggiore ai dettagli. La colazione era sufficiente, ma se si desidera usufruire dell'american breakfast bisogna pagare un sovrapprezzo. La hall √® un po' deludente, come del resto l'arredamento, moderno ma senza gusto. Il punto informazioni all'ingresso √® invece efficiente e disponibile, ed √® possibile prenotare tour direttamente presso la reception. Insomma nella media, ma non all'altezza di un cinque stelle.",3,2018,08,24
226,Cinque stelle di cartone,"Il disagio maggiore √® all‚Äôarrivo. Ti dicono che devi parcheggiare tu in un parcheggio privato a pagamento a 100 mt dall‚Äôhotel e, con identica cortesia, ti dicono di conservare il biglietto.
Quando fai il check out te lo timbrano e poi paghi il parcheggio come se fossi andato normalmente. Una discreta presa in giro, per√≤ la sceneggiata √® carina.
La camera √® anch‚Äôessa carina con la caratteristica del lavandino totalmente crepato con simpatiche linee nere che ne rilevano l'et√†. Il resto √® un po‚Äô triste.
La tristezza aumenta al ristorante: niente finestre e servizio ‚Äúa fortuna‚Äù. Anche per la colazione tutto dipende dal cameriere: non c'√® uno standard. Passi da quello bravo ed efficiente a quello che invece dell‚Äôespresso ti porta un semplice bricco di acqua calda. Sul tavolo non ci sono bustine del te‚Äô e rimane la curiosit√† di un messaggio simbolico.
Spendete meno e spendete meglio: a Disneyland l‚Äôavrebbero probabilmente incluso nelle attrazioni.",2,2018,08,17

Wir waren zum WM Qualifikationsspiel in Belfast. Der Empfang war top. Leider war das Zimmer noch nicht fertig. War aber kein Problem.

Zimmer. sehr ruhig und komfortabel.
Wir werden bei Gelegenheit wieder kommen!",5,2017,10,08

Desayuno muy b√°sico y sencillo.",3,2017,09,10
226,Hotel eccezionale,"Strategicamente posizionato nel centro storico della citt√†; consente di visitare e conoscere Belfast a piedi. Nelle immediate vicinanze della struttura troverete diversi locali in cui assaggiare specialit√† tipiche della capitale Nord Irlandese.

Camere curate, servizio di primo ordine, e disponibilit√† del personale completano la presentazione d'impatto che la struttura offre fin dal primo accesso alla hall. ottima colazione a buffet, buono il ristorante interno.

Consigliato!",4,2017,08,24
226,Muy cuidado.,"Es una gran opci√≥n para pasar la noche en Belfast. El hotel es caro ya que es un 5 estrellas y ofrece lo que te esperas del mismo: buen servicio, limpieza y dise√±o. 
El √∫nico pero es que nos dieron una habitaci√≥n para minusv√°lidos teniendo el lavabo y el espejo muy bajo y nos dificultaba un poco el uso del mismo. Es algo que deber√≠an tener en cuenta ya que pagas caro la habitaci√≥n y esperas todas las comodidades que un precio as√≠ incluye.",4,2017,08,10
226,Gutes Hotel mit kleinen Sch√∂nheitsfehlern,"Das Hotel ist in Downtown sehr gut gelegen. Die Zimmer sind gro√ü und das Bad ist mit Wanne und Dusche ausgestattet. Es ist trotz der zentralen Lage sehr ruhig.

Von der Auswahl beim Fr√ºhst√ºck war ich auch etwas entt√§uscht.",4,2017,05,30
226,Mejorable,"Correcto, pero no un 5*. Desayuno buffet con poca variedad. El mantenimiento no est√° a la altura de la categor√≠a (bombillas fundidas, desconchones en muebles). Ubicaci√≥n muy buena y centrica. Gran cantidad de restaurantes en cercan√≠as.",4,2017,05,17

226,Rundum zufrieden,"Ja, das gibt es noch, hier tr√§gt der Concierge noch einen Zylinder. Freundlich werde ich empfangen und man nimmt mir den Koffer bereits am Taxi aus der Hand. Freundliche Mitarbeiter machen den Check-In unproblematisch und routiniert. Die Zimmer sind renoviert und entsprechen meinem pers√∂nlichen Geschmack, etwas modernisierter Art Deco Style mit einem Schuss Vintage. Auch das Bad sehr sch√∂n und top sauber. Tolle Matratze, die einen entspannten Schlafkomfort bietet. Das Fr√ºhst√ºck sehr umfangreich und vielf√§ltig. Kaffee und Tee werden an den Tisch gebracht, die Speisen bestellt man √† la carte und werden ebenfalls am Platz serviert. Dies ist in Zeiten des grossen Buffets selten geworden, aber wird von mir als sehr angenehm empfunden. Der letzte grosse Pluspunkt wird f√ºr die zentrale Lage im Herzen Belfasts vergeben. Restaurants, Gesch√§fte und Sehensw√ºrdigkeiten (City Hall) sind fussl√§ufig erreichbar. Die 3 N√§chte, die ich dort verbrachte habe ich genossen und ich kann das Hotel sehr empfehlen.",5,2017,03,22
226,Rod stewart coincidio conmigo en el Hotel,"La vida es imprevisible y lo digo porque en mi viaje a Belfast para ver el concierto de Rod Stewart nos
quedamos en este hotel de 5 estrellas a pocos metros del ayuntamiento de Belfast y casualmente era el mismo hotel donde se quedaba Rod stewart y su equipo lo cual realmente fue increible.
Respecto al hotel puedo decir que es confortable y adecuado pero las habitaciones carecen de la suficiente luz artificial en el ba√±o lo cual es imperdonable en un 5 estrellas, por otro lado el servicio es bueno aunque tengo que criticar duramente la costumbre anglosajona de no adaptarse a los clientes de otros paises por ejemplo en la cuestion de horarios de comidas.Pienso que en un 5 estrellas tienen que hacer sentir al cliente como en su casa y es necesario tener las cocinas abiertas lo suficiente para poder dar servicio en todo momento al cliente y no cerrar a las 21:00 horas.
Por lo demas es un 5 estrellas 
Normalito que aqui en Espa√±a hay muchos 4 estrellas a su altura o incluso mejor.",4,2016,11,18

226,Bemerkenswertes Hotel in guter Lage !,"Mein Mann und ich haben 4 N√§chte im Superior Room gebucht.

Positiva:
Sehr freundliches, hilfsbereites und kompetentes Team in allen Bereichen.
Grosses, modernes und stylisches Zimmer, trotzdem f√ºhlt man sich heimelig.
Das Bad ist ebenfalls gro√üartig, auch f√ºr Touristen vom Kontinent.
Beim Fr√ºhst√ºck bleiben keine W√ºnsche offen.
Der Flatscreen ist angenehm gro√ü.
WLAN ist kostenlos in allen Zimmern.
Auch den Parkservice fand mein Mann sehr angenehm: Anruf gen√ºgt und das Auto wird einem in kurzer Zeit vor dem Hotel bereitgestellt.
Minuspunkt: Parkplatz kostet 17 Pfund pro Tag.

Negativa:
Die Fenster sind schlecht schallisoliert:
Man h√∂rt den gewaltigen Verkehr ziemlich laut (ab 04:30).
Von 09:00 bis 21:00 l√§utet die Glocke vom gegen√ºber liegenden Glockenturm mit einer Lautst√§rke, die man  ca. 1zu3  im Zimmer h√∂rt.
Au√üerdem glaubt man in London zu sein, denn man wird st√ºndlich mit demselben Gel√§ute wie Big Ben beschallt.
Bei Sonnenschein ist es Im Zimmer sehr warm. Trotz Klimaanlage kamen wir nicht unter 25 Grad.

Fazit: Das Fitzwiliam ist mit kleineren M√§ngeln ein Top-Hotel in Belfast. Wir kommen gerne wieder und empfehlen es weiter!",4,2016,08,21

Abz√ºge gibts f√ºrs Parking, haben 15¬£ f√ºrs Parking bezahlt, unser Auto war jedoch voller Vogelkacke am n√§chsten Tag das war nicht sooo toll (Parking ist ebenfalls direkt gegen√ºber vom Hotel m√∂glich habe aber keine Ahnung was das kosten w√ºrde).

226,"Lo mejor, su ubicaci√≥n. El trato al cliente, decepcionante.","Para nosotros ha sido decepcionante nuestra estancia de 4 noches en este hotel. Lo mejor es sin duda, su ubicaci√≥n, al lado de la estaci√≥n de bus y tren de Great Victoria Street y a 5 minutos andando del centro de Belfast. El hotel tiene una decoraci√≥n muy moderna, aunque en los pasillos apenas se ve nada. Las habitaciones son muy amplias y est√°n limpias y bien decoradas, aunque las ventanas no pueden abrirse con lo que no tiene ventilaci√≥n natural. Hay que utilizar continuamente el aire acondicionado, bastante ruidoso, para refrescar un poco la habitaci√≥n que es tremendamente calurosa. Pero a parte de lo anterior, lo que fue totalmente decepcionante para nosotros fue la pol√≠tica que siguen con sus clientes: al hacer el check-in, y aunque nuestra estancia estaba totalmente pagada desde febrero, nos pidieron la tarjeta de cr√©dito para ""posibles extras"" que utiliz√°ramos y nos aseguraron que no se nos iba a hacer ning√∫n cargo en la misma si no hac√≠amos uso de ning√∫n servicio m√°s del hotel. Totalmente falso. No hicimos ning√∫n gasto extra y cual fue nuestra sorpresa al ver que, dos d√≠as despu√©s de abandonar el hotel, hab√≠a un dinero retenido en mi tarjeta por importe de 400 libras. Me puse en contacto inmediatamente con la jefa de operaciones del hotel, Gemma Connor, y tengo que darle las gracias por su r√°pida respuesta y porque al d√≠a siguiente ten√≠a mi dinero disponible. Seg√∫n me inform√≥, la pol√≠tica del hotel es retener 100 libras por noche, y yo me pregunto ¬øeternamente?. Lo cierto es que todo esto habr√≠a sido evitable y que lo que no hay que hacer es mentir y enga√±ar al cliente,  y hay que informar de que tambi√©n existe la opci√≥n de pagar el servicio que se utilice al momento sin tener que facilitar la tarjeta en recepci√≥n al llegar. En resumen, un hotel con pretensiones de 5* pero que por desgracia, no llega ni de lejos a hoteles de menor categoria. Desde luego, si volviera a Belfast buscar√≠a un hotel por la misma zona, pero evitar√≠a el Fitzwilliam.",2,2012,08,08
226,Buon albergo.,"Buon albergo. Centrale, pulito con wireless gratuito. Unico difetto: colazione, anche quella continentale, misera. Per il breakfast tradizionale un sovrapprezzo esorbitante. Non abbiamo provato il ristorante. Il personale e' molto efficiente. In definitiva un giudizio positivo.",5,2012,07,25
226,angenehm modern,"Das Hotel ist insgesamt sehr modern eingerichtet, aber nicht zu modern, dass es abschrecken oder kalt wirken w√ºrde. Unser Zimmer war gro√ü und ger√§umig. Die Farben in schwarz/wei√ü gehalten wobei mit gelb ein paar Akkzente gesetzt wurden. WLAN ist frei und gut im Zimmer zu empfangen. Alles super sauber. Im Bad fehlen leider ein wenig Ablagefl√§chen.  Es gibt sogar einen Parkservice. Das Parkhaus kostet allerdings etwas, aber wenn man mit dem Auto anreist, hat man in Belfast keine andere Chance zu Parken. Pubs und Einkaufsm√∂glichkeiten sind direkt im Umfeld vom Hotel. Das Personal ist sehr nett.

Der Service - angefangen beim Check-In √ºber den Concierge bis zum Park-Service - war einsame Spitze. Fragen wurden sehr zuvorkommend und freundlich beantwortet. Zudem war das Zimmer (Standard) sehr modern und stylish eingerichtet. Das Hotel muss in letzter Zeit modernisiert worden sein. Das Bad war recht ger√§umig, sodass Wanne und eine separate Dusche Platz finden. Wir h√§tten stundenlange unter dem Grohe Raindance duschen k√∂nnen... Die Lage des Hotels ist f√ºr Erkundungen des Stadtzentrums optimal.

226,Sehr modernes designer Hotel in klasse Lage mit super Service,"Der erste Eindruck des Zimmers war ungew√∂hnlich: Das Interieur war alles in gr√ºn, schwarz und wei√ü T√∂nen gehalten. Nach den ersten Minuten wurde mir klar, dass diese hervorragend auf ein ander abgestimmte Farbnuancen waren, die ein sehr angenehmes Ambiente geschaffen haben. Die Zimmer sind ger√§umig mit gro√üem Bett, Coach und Schreibtisch. Leider kostet auch hier das Internet.
Das Bad war hoch modern mit neuster Einrichtung (Grohe) versehen (inkl. Duche und Badewanne). Alles war in angenehmen schwarz-wei√ü gehalten: Elegant! Alles war sehr sauber.
Das gesamte Hotel war sehr neu und modern eingerichtet. 
Die Lobby war sehr ger√§umig und mit einer gem√ºtlichen Sitzecke an einem (k√ºnstlichen) Kamin.
Der Service war hervorragend! Als ich am tag der Abreise feststellte, das ich keine GBP mehr hatte um das taxi zum Flughafen zu bezahlen (Kreditkartenzahlung ist ein Noririschen taxis un√ºblich, bzw., nicht m√∂glich), arrangierte die Rezeption ein Barzahlung des Taxis von der Hotelkasse, so dass ich das Hotel (f√ºrs Taxi) mit Kreditkarte bezahlen konnte. 
Ferner war ich √ºberrascht, das w√§hrend der Zeit, in der ich das Zimmer zum Abendessen verlie√ü, noch einmal der Room-Service kam: Das bad wurde gereinigt, Seife und Handt√ºcher geordnet, die Gardinen vorgezogen, die Bettdecke aufgeschlagen und die fernbedienung f√ºr den TV auf das Kopfkissen gelegt. Sehr nett!
Hervorragender Service!
Das Restaurant war auch sehr modern in einem sehr ansprechenden Design aus verschiedensten Holz-T√§felungen eingerichtet. Der Service war super, das Fr√ºhst√ºcksbuffet jedoch sehr d√ºrftig (Toast, etwas Marmelade, etwas Obst und Kuchen). Alle anderen Gerichte (Eier etc.)  kosten erheblichen Aufpreis, schade!",5,2010,06,22
