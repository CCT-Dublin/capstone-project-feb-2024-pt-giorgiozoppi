141,Ask for a room where the toilet has a door - apparently not all rooms do and there is no bathroom door,"I recently stayed at the Londoner for 6 nights - I had two booked with iprefer points, one with a mix of points and cash the other 3 nights fully paid .- I acknowledge this was a bit complex but emailed the hotel in advance and all bookings were together to try to stay in the same room. We arrived and  checked in and I always wonder if they treat you as a lesser guest if you book with points and they certainly did here - they gave us a room with had no toilet door - you could see where it was missing - and the problem is there is no door to the bathroom so in essence the toilet opened to the whole hotel room - I don’t know if this meets any hotel hygiene standards - I called down and first the reception was shocked there was no door then back tracked and said not all our toilets have doors - if that is true I highly recommend asking for a room with a toilet door when booking ( or better still choose a hotel where this is standard ). We requested a room change and they found another room and simply brought the key up - we had a lot of luggage but no offer to help - the hotel was not busy at 930pm at night but the receptionist just bolted  
I was told to get the key reset after each booking as it would lock us out - - but did not expect to be locked out of my room at 8qm on each proposed “checkout” day - I was - in my robe and swimmers unable to get into my room and being told by the staff member outside the room to go to reception to sort it out - surely keys lockout at check out time not 8am?
To add salt to the wounds on checkout they tried to charge me for two breakfasts which we did not have - I advised her of this and she did not apologise for the error and rather stated I will need to investigate this - still haven’t received an apology or an outcome - 
I stayed at 5 star hotels in Paris and Amsterdam prior to this and usually stay at hotel 41 or the Langham in London - I travel a lot and have been treated  so much better and more politely in all standards of hotels 
I have titanium status with I-prefer rewards program - clearly doesn’t help to be a loyal member of their sister hotels and rewards program either 
Perhaps look elsewhere if you don’t have thick skin as this hotel seems to intend to offend not welcome",2,2024,10,15
141,Brilliant ,"What's not to like! 
The hotel is spotless with friendly staff, the facilities available in this location of London was unbelievable. 
Comfy bed, cool bathroom! 
The Spa facilities was great! We had a meal at Whitcomb's the food was great and the breakfast there was good also. 
No complaints at all! ",5,2024,10,14
141,A world class experience,"The only place to stay whilst in London…. From the moment you walk through the front doors until the moment you leave, you are made to feel so welcome and nothing is too much trouble.
The location is extremely central…
The facilities are amazing from roof top bars, wonderful restaurants to a gym and  pool
The rooms are spacious and luxurious.
I could not recommend this hotel enough…",5,2024,10,12
141,More than we could have wished for,"May I take this opportunity on behalf of my wife and I, to thank everybody involved at  the wonderful Londoner Hotel. It was our first ever but all too short visit and we are now contemplating another slightly longer stay next month.

From the very first moment we arrived the service received from the door and welcoming staff was exemplary...and that continued throughout our stay.  We were fortunate enough to find that our room had been upgraded, and as has been detailed elsewhere the room was exquisite in every respect. In the afternoon we had booked the champagne high tea in The Stage and it has to be said that it was by far and away the best we have ever experienced.

We had booked to see Les Miserables in the evening and were concerned that the table we had booked post theatre in Joshua`s Tavern may not be held for us. But again there was no problem whatsoever as the Tavern staff assured us that there would be no problem, and indeed that was the case.

We then thought we would like to enjoy late night cocktails in the Izakaya Terrace Lounge, and true to form the staff and experience there was first class. To end the night we thought we would have a nightcap (hot chocolate/latte) and there again we were not to be disappointed in The Residence.

We completed our stay with an excellent breakfast in Whitcombs this morning.

All in all our somewhat brief stay at The Londoner was more than we could have wished for and we will certainly be returning next month. Likewise we would highly recommend the centrally located Londoner Hotel to anyone.",5,2024,10,12
141,5-star experience that did not disappoint!,"My family and I had an INCREDIBLE time staying at the Londoner for our first trip to London. The location is absolutely perfect and the hotel is immaculate. 

I'll start with the building/hotel itself. It is stunning! It takes your breath away as the door man opens the door and you step inside for the first time. No one spared the little details. There are many different floors and areas exclusively for guest use and each one is more beautiful than the next!

The room had a ""smart"" lighting system that also allowed for us to request housekeeping services or to ""do not disturb"" with the touch of a button. The bed was so comfortable that I looked forward to sleeping in it each night! Our glass water bottles were always refilled and the coffee/tea pantry was well stocked. The toilet has heated seats with a self-cleaning feature and various bidet settings. 

The restaurants on-site were spectacular. One night we ate at the Japanese restaurant on the 8th floor, and we enjoyed snacks/small plates frequently at The Residence and the main lobby hotel. The staff made wonderful mixed drinks and appeared genuinely happy to be there. 

I have to touch on the breakfast- breakfast is my favorite meal and I am telling you; it did not disappoint!! The pancakes are my absolute favorite! We particularly appreciated service from AKHILA and RIPON who greeted us with smiles and warm welcomes each morning! 

The staff members are what makes The Londoner truly stand out. They were ever-present and always ensuring that we had no unmet needs. They were all so warm and welcoming and felt like family by the time we left. 

It was a stay that I will always remember and I can't imagine any place that could top the experience we had staying at The Londoner.",5,2024,10,11
141,Awful loud music spolied a potentially great place to stay,"So noisy all evening from music thumping through my room in the hotel - private party guests on top floor were having a lovely time - my room on 6th floor vibrating to the bass. Not really what I hoped for at  £570 a night! Staff were lovely, room nice, food great, no disturbance from outside the hotel - just incredibly noisy inside. Super disappointing. Wouldn’t ever stay here again as a result.",2,2024,10,08
141,Beautiful and comfortable hotel in the heart of London,"Stayed here for 3 nights for a quick weekend trip to London. The location was excellent - very easy to several different tube stations and easy to walk to a lot of places. The building is beautiful with great fragrances, modern and artistic design, and exceptional cleanliness. Everyone we interacted with were very kind and accommodating. Sometimes it was a little difficult to understand what they were saying because they had accents and spoke a bit fast. The room was small but more than adequate. It was very quiet. The fancy Toto toilet was a surprise and the shower was very refreshing. The bath products smelled amazing. The bed was quite comfortable although the pillows were a little too soft to our liking. Our room package included breakfast and it was great. I would definitely stay here again.",5,2024,10,08
141,A Great Central Stay,"What an amazing hotel. Despite its central position, The Londoner is very new & could easily be missed.
The central areas are very spacious & the rooms very well appointed.
We particularly enjoyed the exclusive area for guests. This was great for a complimentary snack & newspapers prior to & after check in.
Breakfast was very good with a large range of choices.
The lobby & rooftop bars were both excellent venues to meet for a glass of champagne although were busy & worth booking. 
We had an evening meal at The Whitcombe restaurant. This was all good but not exceptional.",5,2024,10,07
141,Overpriced and poorly designed,"Not value for money. 
Room 312 has soundproofing issues and you can hear water draining pipes from bathroom above. We had to move rooms as it was impossible to rest. 
Automated toilets are noisy, impractical and unnecessary.
Bed was comfortable.",2,2024,10,05
141,Wonderful hotel,"The hotel is stunning, fantastic artwork and furnishings. A true 5* hotel in London. Location is great for West End. 

I stayed in a corner suite which was great, the binoculars are a great touch for people watching in Leicester Square.

Everything from the food, service and facilities were fantastic.

I organised a business conference for 220 guests, we all stayed in the hotel for two nights and used the main ballroom and meeting rooms. We had great feedback from guests.",5,2024,10,04
141,Excellent hotel situated in one of the nicest parts of London.  Staff were amazing.  A wonderful experience.,"Excellent hotel situated in one of the nicest parts of London.  Staff were amazing.  A wonderful experience.
The only reason i didn't give a 5 star rating wasthat I had to contact the hotel via email a couple of times, and then had to phone them regarding an over-charge that I found on the final bill/invoice I received by email a few days later that I wanted a refund for. The scenatio was: we were offered breakfast to be included when checking in, and accepted that.  We were told we can either go down to the restaurant or have it delivered to the room.  On both days we had it delievred to the room.  On the final invoice I noticed we were charged the standard breakfast fee, but then were charged a separate room service fee for both breakfasts.  We were essentially charged double.
However, when I phoned the hotel (after not getting a timely response by email) the person did find the issue and told me it would be refunded back to my card.  Just something to check if you stay there.",4,2024,10,03
141,Exceptional at so many levels .,"I was one of the first guests at this marvellous hotel when it opened. And it has gone from strength to strength particularly relative to the standard of food and the exceptional service one gets here. With London and all its. choices this is the only one that I go to. 
Simon-the general manager and his team are visible and you can just feel that the sense of duty and care is fully knitted within the fabric of this great stop over

Go. You will not be disappointed",5,2024,10,02
141,Amazing,"My mum & I stayed at the Londoner in September, and this was definitely one of the best hotel experiences we have ever had. The staff were amazing & so accommodating, specifically Arabella on reception who went above & beyond to ensure we enjoyed our stay. She is so lovely & a real credit to the team at the Londoner. Arabella gave us a tour of the hotel & directed us to the residence bar, where we were able to enjoy a wine & some tapas. The room was fabulous, the bed was so comfy!!! Would definitely stay again!",5,2024,10,02
141,"Great value for money, amazing spa!","The spa is amazing! A must do spa in London with great food and amenities. The room was nice and clean. The room service food was a bit bland to be honest but that’s not what we went for. Can’t complain! If you want luxury then go to a luxury hotel in London but for a nice London hotel at a good price, I recommend. Very clean and comfortable, great if you’re on a budget",5,2024,09,30
141,Perfect hotel in Central London,"This luxury hotel totally blew me away 
Its understated elegance makes it a very classy place to be , in the best location in London. Situated in Leicester Square, the hotel is easily accessible to many tourist attractions, shops, restaurants and nightlife 
The corner suite was very spacious and with a large bathroom, and the staff were very helpful throughout 
Breakfast was delicious and had a great choice, and the indoor pool was gorgeous with wonderful bedding to relax 

Would highly recommend The Londoner for a leisure or business stay",5,2024,09,29
141,Ovepriced and terrible customer experience,"Stayed at the Londoner Friday - Sunday on weekend of 28th sept 24. The staff were very rude especially the person at the complimentary bar who refused to serve my husband and I. It was giving racism. Because he served other people who came after us. Furthermore we requested (in person) for cutlery and plates to be brought up to our room and that was never done. The person we spoke to at reception in person already had an attitude so I wasn’t surprised he never sent anything up. Overall really disappointing experience considering I was there for my birthday and also because it’s so expensive. 

The positives were the spa which was really nice, the room was nice and the building seems well kept. 

Also I found it weird how in my bathroom, the art that was selected said “I hate poor people”. Just seems really tone deaf and elitist. Overall I had a nice weekend due to the activities I had planned and I was mostly out of the hotel but the time I did spend at the hotel was just weird. I definitely will not be going back",2,2024,09,29
141,London Baby!,"Check-in reception experience was second to none ie, attendant left her post, walked with me and pointed out all amenities. Nice touch! Room is very modern and was very clean and well-appointed with everything one would expect.  I was on a lower floor facing Leicester Sq but was quite surprised how quiet it was. Incredible breakfast on lobby floor! Had a couple of pints at Joshua's Tavern (secretly attached to main floor). It's a must go! Roof top has great food and great views. Location is fabulous & perfectly central. Had an early morning departure (sadly missed another hotel breakfast) but doorman handled my cab ride to LHR. What a memorable stay. I'll definitely be back!",5,2024,09,26
141,The Londoner : setting the bar at the highest levels,"Staying at The Londoner is a most exclusive experience. With a fantastic location, only a few steps from the most vibrant neighborhoods of London, The Londoner provides you with an elegant, warm and caring environment. Cannot thank enough The Londoner’s team for making us feel welcomed at all times. Thank you for allowing us to live a fantastic experience during these few days in London.",5,2024,09,23
141,A Jewel Of a Hotel In the Heart Of London,"What a wonderful hotel. I was blown away by everything and the location cannot be beaten.
The rooms are well appointed and the beds are so incredibly comfortable.  The breakfast was varied and had some great vegetarian options, all served with a smile by the lovely staff.
This hotel has paid attention to the details, nothing has been missed.
Finally, the guest lounge is a great feature with complimentary drinks and snack options throughout the day.
Would recommend 100%.",5,2024,09,23
141,A great place to stay for your next business or leisure trip.,The rooms are stunning. The location is very central and easy to get to the tube for commuting. The breakfast was perfectly arranged with lots of options to accommodate all different food preferences. I highly recommend this hotel if you are looking for an option in London.,5,2024,09,23
141,The most fantastic hotel in London!,"The Londoner Hotel is simply fabulous, from their attentive staff to the amazing fully stocked rooms, to the delicious breakfast, I cannot recommend it more! The location is perfect, walking distance to Covent Garden, Trafalgar Square, Piccadilly Circus, Soho and The Strand. This hotel is truly a 5-star experience, you will not regret it!",5,2024,09,23
141,Best hotel stay ever in London...only at The Londoner!,"What an incredible 7 night stay at The Londoner Hotel.  From the moment I checked in, I felt welcomed and special.  Everything about the hotel was excellent - gorgeous rooms, wonderful facilities and exceptional staff throughout.  Thank you - I look forward to another vist.",5,2024,09,23
141,5 Star,An outstanding hotel in central London with 5 star service. Great selection of bars and drinks . The number 8 roof bar is highly recommended The spa area is beautiful and very relaxing.  The rooms are stunning with immaculate room service and house staff .,5,2024,09,22
141,I feel very special when I visit The Londoner!,"As soon as I walk into The Londoner I feel so very looked after & all my needs are taken care of immediately. I’ve stayed at this hotel several times now & the staff/service are always second to none.
The location is fantastic & the rooms are very well thought out & modern.  You don’t really hear any outside noise especially with the location being in Leicester Sq I think that they’re soundproofed.
It’s particularly lovely staying here at Christmas time to with all the decorations & events that happen at this time.
The breakfast is always presented so lovely & again the service is excellent.  All the staff are so friendly/polite & professional I would like to say thank you to Olivier he’s so lovely with such a great personality that brightens up the dullest of days, but his attention to detail is fabulous so helpful indeed.
Thanks again The Londoner, hopefully see you soon.  Keep up the good work.",5,2024,09,19
141,"Boutique, quality experience with exceptional staff","A clever super boutique concept that resonates - quality rooms, super helpful and friendly staff - Calentha was simply the best! 
The Retreat, the Residence and the Breakfast were higher quality and hit the mark each day. 
Location is great and easy access to the West End",5,2024,09,18
141,The Londoner Afternoon Tea,"I lovely place to have afternoon tea whiles watching a nice musical entertainment. The scenery is beautiful and it's easy to get from Leicester square station. the cakes was nice and the sandwiches was filling, plus the glass of champagne was nice.",5,2024,09,16
141,My favorite boutique hotel in London.,"This was one of my favorite hotels I’ve ever stayed at. The people that work here made my experience one of the best. When I arrived, “Arabella” greeted me and not only checked me in, but then walked me throughout the property, offered me a welcome drink and told me that she was available and that if I ever needed anything to let her know. This was the type of service I got throughout the property from all the staff that I met. My room was beautiful, comfortable and elegant overlooking Leiscester Square. It had a high end amenities, a powerful hairdryer which I appreciated since I had forgotten mine and beautiful details. My first night there I went up to the 8th floor and they were able to accommodate me last minute on the balcony overlooking the sunset with the Thames and London Eye in the distance.
I can’t say enough great things about this hotel, and it’s staff. I’m looking forward to going back.  Hopefully next time I’ll be able to check out the spa, the massive gym, pool and have dinner in their restaurant by the fireplace.",5,2024,09,15
141,"Perfect location, service & hospitality","Perfect location for theatre, shopping, food, all within a few minutes walk of the hotel. Service from all members of staff first class and what you would expect from a 5 star hotel, cannot wait to revisit next year might even try to squeeze in an extra visit it was that good.",5,2024,09,15
141,"Second Stay, Still Amazing: An Incredible Hotel","We had such a great experience at this hotel last spring that we decided to return this summer. We were celebrating our wedding anniversary, and the staff went above and beyond to make us feel special. Upon arrival, we were welcomed with champagne and found a complimentary bottle, chocolates, and a thoughtful hand-written note waiting in our room. The staff was incredibly nice and attentive throughout our stay. Room service had a great variety of options and always arrived quickly. The spa was a highlight—we had an amazing couple's massage and enjoyed the pool and sauna. If you're looking to feel pampered and stay in a convenient location, I definitely recommend this hotel!",5,2024,09,14
141,Not the Best Choice.,"Very disappointed in our king room. Very small, with no drawers, minimal closet space, and minimal bathroom space. There is no space for drying hair or putting on makeup, either at the bathroom counter (which is not separate from the bedroom) or in the bed area. We mostly lived out of suitcases on a small sofa for four nights and spent much time squeezing by each other.  Beds were comfortable. The staff was very accommodating, and the location in Leicester Square was accessible to many areas if touring London. You are literally in Leicester Square, which is VERY busy.  Because the door to the building is in Leicester Square, there is no drop-off area for your suitcases, so Uber drops off at the side of the building. This was very awkward, and there was no bellman or other representative guiding you.  The hotel decor is nice.  The Spa/pool area was small but well done.  The in-pool jacuzzi was lukewarm with minimal water circulation - disappointing. The lounge was nice, but on two of our four nights, two of the restaurants were closed. Our room was not worth the higher price, and the lack of space took away from our trip.  We loved London but would choose another hotel next time.",2,2024,09,12
141,The perfect night away!,"My son and I stayed a night in a deluxe city view room last weekend. We thought the hotel was just perfect - the room was lovely, the service exceptional, the retreat area so relaxing and the resident lounge was our favourite place in the hotel. We were celebrating my son's 13th Birthday so it was the perfect hotel to relax in, get spoilt and the location for visiting the West End shows was ideal. We had breakfast at the hotel which was exceptional. We cant wait to return again!",5,2024,09,11
141,Outstanding Hospitality,"From the moment we arrived, we were treated with exceptional care and attention. Every staff member, from the doormen to the reception, restaurant, bar, and room service teams, made us feel truly valued. The hospitality was outstanding. The food, wine selection, and cocktails were superb, making the entire experience even more memorable. I would happily stay at the Londoner again.",5,2024,09,11
141,The Best of Times,Exceptional in every aspect - from the greeting by the Doorman and the Reception staff - to the attention the detail in the room - from the light system to the Opera glasses - the quirky umbrella - the coat hooks - the fluffy slippers - the thickest notepad and of course the heated toilet seat!! Just wonderful fun.,5,2024,09,08
141,Reserve your bed at the pool,"A stunning hotel and great staff 
MY TIP FOR POOL!
People reserve the beds at the side of pool  so i was asked to move as 1 person had reserved  the bed i sat on ...it was a double Cabbana  which looks like it would be appropriate for 2 couples as it is 2 double beds...i moved to a very uncomfirtable single bed type thing!
Why are you allowing one person to reserve a 4 bed  to them selfs ?
The very polite attendant thought this was acceptable !
And the reseved sign implies one half is reserved not the other half .
A great stay i would recomend  the Londener but this tarnished my last morning .",4,2024,09,08
141,EXCELLENT STAY!,"This is a must! Clean, comfortable and beautiful room, caring staff, attention to detail, excellent restaurant, incredible pool and spa facility, wonderful location! On arrival we were greeted at the front desk, our room was ready with early check in and we were invited to a latte in the lobby prior to going to our room. When we arrived at our beautiful well appointed room, our bags had already been delivered. Whitcombs restaurant was excellent for breakfast and dinner. The pool and spa area were relaxing and immaculate. The staff is always friendly and helpful. Highly recommend!",5,2024,09,05
141,Incredibly frustrating and disappointing experience,"We had an incredibly frustrating and disappointing experience at The Londoner Hotel during our stay in February 2024. Our client had their watch, ring, and 2000 euros in cash stolen from the gym locker room—a blatant security failure on the hotel's part. For a so-called 5-star establishment, the security is appallingly inadequate. It seems anyone can freely enter the gym locker room and steal from guests without consequence!
Despite having CCTV footage of the incident, The Londoner Hotel has refused to cooperate with the Metropolitan Police in finding the culprits. It has now been over six months, and they still have not compensated our client for the damages. During our stay, they repeatedly pacified us with false promises, claiming they were working on a solution. But it became clear after check-out that they had no intention of taking responsibility or resolving the issue.
Instead, they have unjustly hidden behind their insurance company and have not responded to any of our messages since. This behavior shows a complete disregard for the safety and well-being of their patrons. It is shocking that a hotel with such a reputation cares so little about its guests being robbed on its premises.
If you value your belongings and expect even the basic standards of security, avoid The Londoner Hotel. Their negligence and lack of accountability are not only disappointing but entirely unacceptable. We will never return and strongly advise others to stay elsewhere.",1,2024,09,04
141,Abysmal Security and Total Lack of Accountability,"I had a terrible experience at The Londoner Hotel, which has left me deeply disappointed. In February 2024, my watch, ring, and 2000 euros in cash were stolen from the gym locker room. For a supposed 5-star hotel, the security is shockingly poor, and the response from the management has been even worse.

It has now been over six months since the incident, and I have not been compensated for my losses. What’s more, despite having CCTV footage of the incident, the hotel has not cooperated with the Metropolitan Police to find the culprits responsible for the theft. Instead, they are unjustly hiding behind their insurance company, showing no willingness to take responsibility or make things right.

To make matters worse, after a while the management has completely ignored my messages and has shown zero concern for the fact that a guest was robbed on their premises. It is unacceptable for any hotel, especially one that claims to be 5-star, to demonstrate such disregard for its patrons' safety and security.

I strongly urge anyone considering staying at The Londoner Hotel to think twice. A hotel that does not prioritize the safety of its guests and fails to address serious issues like theft does not deserve its reputation. Stay elsewhere, where guest security and customer care actually matter.",1,2024,09,04
141,Royalty,"I was nervous to stay at the Londoner
But I never felt out of place once, the
staff made me feel like the only
person staying at the establishment.
Calantha and Cassandra were in

option. Thank you Calantha for
making this experience one to

141,Do not stay here if you want to sleep!,This is our second time staying here but never again! Last night a wedding was on below my room and the music was so loud and stayed on until 1.20am despite being told by reception it would go off at midnight. I have a 9 year old daughter who was crying as she couldn’t sleep. So tonight (Sunday) i try to get to sleep at 11pm as we are both exhausted and the music is blasting below us again! Reception not even answering the phone this evening disgusting! This is not a cheap hotel i expected more than to be above what sounds like a nightclub!,1,2024,09,01
141,Great Service,"We booked afternoon tea here for my birthday,  the food was very  good and plenty of it and the service was great, my only criticism would be that it is all very open and people were walking in using the lifts to get to their rooms,  so  it would be better if there was some sort of screening to separate the bar/ dining area from the corridor.",4,2024,09,01
141,Full circle experience of luxury ,"Fantastic location

141,Warm Hospitality & Perfect Location Hotel in London,"After exploring different hotels during business trips, The Londoner has got to be one of our favorite hotels in London. Upon arrival, we stopped by to say hello to Tom Wardley and Alex, the Head Concierge, but they were in a meeting. Instead, we were warmly greeted by Tyler from the concierge team, along with the front desk staff, who were incredibly welcoming and took the time to show us around. We had a wonderful experience meeting our client at the exclusive meeting space called The Gallery Foyer. The hotel’s location was ideal, just one minute walk from Leicester Square. We highly recommend The Londoner Hotel and will definitely be staying there on our next trip to London.",5,2024,08,28
141,Felt like a Mole,"Very nice hotel with great facilities and exceptional service. The hotel is positioned ideally for sightseeing and Covent Garden. 
However do not have a courtyard room (unless you are a mole). 
There is no natural light, although we were on the 4th floor, you felt as though you were underground. 
It is a shame, we wouldn’t book again unless we could have a room with a view or at least some natural light.",4,2024,08,27
141,Fantastic ,"What a speculating evening at the londoen hotel,  we went to the residence where service was super good 
We shall come naxk and try the whisky room as suggested 
Service from Alvato and Damien was incredible thanks to guys.
We ordered a. French martini which was divine. ",5,2024,08,24
141,Wonderful stay.,"I first visited the hotel in July 2024 and the stay didn’t live up to expectations. The hotel is beautiful, restaurants/bars are fabulous, the spa is a cosy little haven away from the hustle and bustle of Leicester square but unfortunately the staff let things down. I was then helped by Cassandre, the hotel manager who went above and beyond to right the wrongs. I decided to give the hotel another chance as everyone has bad days and I’m so glad we did. I returned home today after a very relaxing, stress free stay. The food in whitcomes was to die for! The smoothies in the spa are delicious and the beds are like clouds. From the moment I walked into the hotel I felt relaxed, the lady on reception recognised me after only staying once which I always think is a nice touch. The staff were all so accommodating, we called for an iron and the gentleman was back within 3 minutes! We stayed in a corner suite and the bath was a great addition to the room. If you want a calm relaxing spa break you can stay in this hotel or if you want a busy/crazy night out you’ve got everything you could want on your doorstep. We done both and both times have had a great night. Would highly recommend this hotel",5,2024,08,24
141,My new favorite hotel in London!,"This is my new favorite hotel in London! The service is warm and impeccable, the extras and complimentary amenities made my stay even more enjoyable (I booked through Amex), and my room was gorgeous and very comfortable. I spent 2 hours in the hotel’s hot tub one day. And it’s so convenient to the tube, taxis, and shopping. Can’t wait to return!",5,2024,08,24
141,Great hotel right in the heart of the action.,"Fantastic hotel, excellent location.  We were upgraded to a corner suite which was spacious and comfortable.   We loved the Residence for morning coffee and afternoon drinks - much more cozy than the restaurant or lobby bar.  This is a great and unique feature of this hotel.",5,2024,08,23
141,The londoner hotel,"I stayed at The Londoner for 5 days and for 5 mornings I was able to delight in the delicious and very rich breakfast of this hotel. I must pay particular attention to the service offered by Georgiana, a polite, discreet and sunny girl. For an elegant and refined stay I recommend it",5,2024,08,19
141,A very good first impression!,"I had booked a King for 1 night and had a great stay. The room was on the small side but perfectly appointed and the upkeep of the property is still looking new. 
The residents lounge is a great addition, definitely the place to relax before or after heading out. 
All the staff I had interacted with were welcoming and professional.
I didn't get to use the facilities such as the gym or spa however i can see myself booking again in future as the location, facilities, service and pricepoint make this unmatched in the local area.",5,2024,08,19
141,Calm oasis in the madness.,"We have stayed in over 30 different London hotels over the years and this has got to be one of the best overall hotels and experiences we have had. 
Of course the location is fabulous if you want to be in the heart of the madness but when you get inside there is silence. 
The hotel interior design is stunning. Every detail is elegant and beautiful. 
Our room was slightly smaller than expected however it was well appointed and very clean. House keeping did an excellent job every day and every member of staff was welcoming. No stuffy staff and we felt very at home. The lounge is an added bonus and a great quiet space for a coffee. 
The best things were the shower, absolutely amazing! The slippers are the best quality from any hotel I have stayed in. One of the reception staff even offered to get me another pair as I loved them so much.  
A great atmosphere always. Cant wait to go back.",5,2024,08,19
141,A great hotel with many touches,"Well were do we start a modern fantastic hotel  with loads of funky areas and places to go to .
The rooms are modern and compact , the gym is fantastic and the pool is lovely with great steamroom.
Breakfast was superb and Olivier the restaurant manager is the best .
The residents lounge is a great place to chill .",5,2024,08,11
141,Luxury and great customer service! The perfect combination.,"This is truly an exceptional hotel, you can’t get a better location. The luxury, hospitality and ambience just complete the perfect stay. 
A special thanks to Mohammed and Olivier at the Whitcomb’s restaurant, very warm welcome! The breakfast is delicious, try their special purple broccoli eggs! In fact all the staff cannot do enough and it’s refreshing to see customer service is at the forefront! Nice touch with the Residence, it was nice to whine down and have a complimentary drink after busy days walking around London. 
We look forward to staying again, make time for the spa.. very relaxing and aesthetically be beautiful!",5,2024,08,11
141,Perfection in London’s West End,"I have just spent 3 days in the company of The Londoner with my wife and 2 young children and what an experience.

It’s not my first time to The Londoner but it is with my family. My wife and I have visited a number of times on business and due to our previous experiences, saw it as the obvious choice for a trip to show our daughters the sites and sounds of central London.

Although the hotel is very mature in its theme and is certainly geared more around an adult clientele, the staff were incredibly receptive of our 2 and 6 year old, making a fuss of them wherever we went.

The hotel speaks for itself in terms of its quality and luxury from top to bottom, it’s the staff however that excel The Londoner into the very best of experiences. 

Every single staff member, from check in to breakfast staff to concierge are exceptional in their professional and friendly conduct. Not only providing top tier service in their respective role, but often going the extra mile to stop and chat and ask how our stay was and make our daughters feel special. 

We certainly are not amongst the celebrity clientele the hotel is used to welcoming, but we honestly felt we were treat in the same way as if we were.

Spotlessly clean, incredible breakfast, unbeatable location, impossibly beautiful inside and out. We loved our short trip and thank you to The Londoner and its wonderful staff for a magical experience.

We look forward to returning in the near future.",5,2024,08,10
141,Great night in a gorgeous suite,"The hospitality and service were great and the suite was beautiful; my partner and I had a lovely evening made all the more special by the calibre of the hotel and the kindness of the staff. My only critique would be an inextensive amount of vegan options on the menu but we ordered food from elsewhere. Hotel is beautiful, no complaints! Thank you so much!",5,2024,08,05
141,July two night stay,"Had a lovely two night stay at The Londoner. Negatives would be that rooms are small, would have liked a little more space. It took a little while to check in as a request I’d made hadn’t been made, complimentary drinks were offered due to this and were appreciated. Also my key card didn’t work to my room on two separate occasions so had to go down to reception to get another key card which was annoying. Other than his hotel was lovely staff were all friendly and helpful. It’s in a very central location for the west end. Would stay again if I was having a treat as it is expensive.",4,2024,07,31
141,"Great Hotel, Better Hospitality",From the moment we checked in at the front desk we felt a warm welcome from Gaya. She was a big reason that our honeymoon started as well as it did! Showed us around the hotel and gave us quite a few tips to know when exploring London. Ripon in the restaurant was also a very nice gentleman that even gave us a few treats on the house because of the special occasion. We will definitely be back and the staff is a big reason for it (as well as the warmed toilet seats with bidets).,5,2024,07,28
141,Super Hotel,"The best hotel I’ve ever been to, it simply  had everything, Great location, friendly helpful staff, spotless hotel, amazing spa, great entertainment, I could go on and on, honesty I’ve  stayed in many hotel’s around London this is by far the best simply amazing.",5,2024,07,28
141,"Great place,  amazing location ","Lovely stay. Very clean hotel. Staff are very engaging and friendly. The rooms are spacious and clean. Comfortable bed and room has great facilities. All toilet seats are automatic and heated. The bathroom lights are on sensors so no scrambling around in the dark looking for the switch. 

I probably had the best mojitos I've ever had in the hotel bar. Bar staff very friendly and accommodating. 

The location of the hotel is perfect if your looking to be right in the mix of all the action. ",5,2024,07,28
141,Innaceptable Room,The Londoner should learn to keep sales promises! I booked a Deluxe Kingsize Room with a City View for 850 € per night. I even asked for a room with a nice view before arrival and during Check-in. What did I get? A room on 3rd floor with a view directly to an old ugly concrete facade across the street with no view at all. Never again!,1,2024,07,27
141,"Fantastic hotel, well located","Excellent hotel, well located.  Great breakfast.  Comfortable bed and pillows.  Upgraded to a suite which had everything you could ask for.  Didn’t use the Retreat or Residence.  Staff were courteous and efficient.  Would definitely stay again.",5,2024,07,27
141,The shower will blow you away,"This hotel is beautiful and the rooms are exquisite to look at. Unfortunately, there is no place to put anything. The closet could hold maybe two shirts and a jacket. One tiny drawer. These rooms were designed for one person traveling on business. Two people with a week's worth of stuff resulted in just a giant mess. Two positives: the staff is incredible and the shower is beyond belief. I'm still dreaming of it.",3,2024,07,24
141,Five stars experience,"We spent 4 nights at The Londoner and it was a great experience for my family and I. Staff went above and beyond what you can expect as far as kindness with guests. Special thanks to Gaia for our flawless check-in, Olivier and Gabriela were the first rays of sunshine you can have to start your day with smiles at breakfast. The hotel facilities are just amazing. Swimming pool is just the top of what you can expect in a hotel right downtown in London. The Gym has more equipment than most of the gyms I’ve seen and is at the edge of technology, it makes your workout more  pleasant. The food and beverage served at The Londoner reflects the quality and the sens of detail that Edwardian Hotels cultivate year after year in each of their properties. I highly recommend The Londoner as you will doubly enjoy your stay in London. Thank you",5,2024,07,24
141,Disappointing 5 star. Not up to the level.,Some parts of the room design didn’t make sense. Toilets kept making noises at midnights. Housekeeping will straight away stomp into your room with only one ring on the door without waiting for guest to response. Took 30 min trying to call the front desk but nobody picked up the call. Ridiculous service level for a 5 star hotel.,3,2024,07,23
141,"Terrible tired, stuffy bedroom, rock hard mattress and inedible room service","Awful room, I’ve stayed in better premier inn rooms. Tiny, stuffy, basic, terribly hard bed, inedible room service. Limited soft drinks, cheap interior of room. I have requested a refund as this feels like a bad joke, they claimed it was an ‘upgrade ‘ too so I dread to think what the original ‘deluxe’ room we had would have been like. 
Avoid this place like the plague unless you’re prepared to spend £3k for a suite.",1,2024,07,23
141,Lovey stay at The Londoner,"Our connecting flight from London to Split was cancelled; so, we made the best of the day/evening with a stay in London. Amex travel services helped book us in this five star hotel, located in iconic Leicester Square. (We squeezed in a few miles along the Thames to see some sites.) While the rooms were on the small size, our experience was delightful. Staff were accommodating, extremely friendly, and helpful. They even sent champagne to our room, knowing we were tired, thirsty, and hassled.  They recommended, and took care of reserving, dinner at Ginza St James.  The food was excellent — fresh and inventive. Because we were staying at the Londoner we were treated to a(nother) bottle of champagne. We were well-rested the following day.",5,2024,07,22
141,Excellent hotel in the heart of London!,"Lovely experience, wonderful staff, great location. Rooms are very clean and a very well stocked mini bar and Nespresso machine available in the room. Shower is really nice too. Gym is very well equipped as well as a relaxing pool area! We will definitely come back!",5,2024,07,22
141,"Modern, clean hotel in the heart of the west end","Big step up from the nearby Thistle Trafalgar where we used to stay. Have spent four weekends in the Londoner over the past year and it has been great every time. The staff are amazing, the rooms are modern and comfortable and the whole hotel has a great vibe",5,2024,07,21
141,Amazing Stay,"I just wrapped up a 7 night stay. My first visit and I know I’ll be back. 

I have traveled the world and have seen and experienced everything along the way. The Londoner gives a truly unique magical experience. 

The service is polite, friendly, welcoming, but not pretentious.  I really felt at home during my week there. The room was well appointed and large by London standards. I especially loved the Toto toilet. The layout of the bathroom was wonderful with a separate wet room for shower and bath. Rooms seemed to be magically cleaned (to a very high standard) within minutes, including evening turndown service. 

The gym and pool area are perfect. The Residence is a beautiful quiet lounge that includes breakfast items in the morning, snacks all day, soft drinks and coffee to order. 

Location is amazing for London. We were able to make a short talk to a new, beautiful dinner every night of our stay. 

Just a couple of things that I would change. The room doesn’t get completely dark. I just couldn’t get blinds to fully seal and some light came from the top too. I do like my bedroom totally dark. But there was zero noise from outside, even when the square was jam packed (my room faced the square). 

And it seemed that every single chair and surface in the pool area was by reservation / pay only. Didn’t have a place to even leave a towel or shoes close. They asked me to leave my stuff in a locker a 3 min walk away. Didn’t make much sense. 

I’ll definitely be back!  Really loved my stay!",5,2024,07,21
141,Well worth it for the west end,"So I’ve stayed at this hotel twice. The first time (after it had recently opened) was a complete shambles, the second time was absolutely fantastic - they had rectified the issues and I was really impressed with our stay. 

The location is excellent for theatre and the west end. The vibe is upmarket, kinda glamorous and a bit bouji which I loved. The common areas (bars, foyer etc) have wonderful interior design and a great atmosphere. 

The check in takes some time and I feel this could still be streamlined a bit, but you do get to sit in the bar and have drinks throughout, rather than waiting at a desk which is good. 

The second time we stayed we were gifted a suite (a gesture to rectify the issues of our first stay). The room was generous by London standards. The bathroom was lovely - great bath. Again really good interior design. 

We had champagne and treats on arrival which was a nice touch (part of the apology!) and our cases were brought to our room promptly. 

The spa is really excellent. Not too busy, and given that it is underground, the illusion of light is incredible - it really seems like the ceiling is letting in natural daylight. Great pool and a lovely place to chill in central london. Last time we stayed we had multiple issues regarding avaiability at the spa (I guess down to poor training of staff as it was newly opened). This had all been rectified. We were able to use the spa even after we had checked out. 

One of the bars we went to (I think the one for residents only) sadly closed quite early (about 11/12ish). This was a shame as we’d have liked to stay there longer after coming back from the theatre. We prefer a quiet bar to the more open public bar in the foyer. It was a lovely spot to hang out. 

One of the standout parts of the stay was breakfast at Whitcomb’s. The best pastries I have ever eaten in my life. The pancakes were also divine - I would go back for breakfast any day if I could. Seriously the best breakfast I’ve had in the uk. It was quite packed though - in terms of lots of tables and lots of people. For a more exclusive hotel I would expect a bit more space - I don’t want to feel like I am part of my neighbours’ conversations/meals. 

Room service was also good. Not too long to wait and really delicious food. Not insanely pricey given it was central london. 

Overall, a great stay. I’m really glad the hotel offered us the chance to come back and make up for the first stay. They convinced me that they’d rectified all the issues, which fell largely down to staff training. I would happily stay again now that they are more established. 

One final thing: there is a really lovely and distinctive but subtle aroma about the hotel - like it has a signature scent. The other day I was walking past (without realising where I was in London) and was like ‘wow, it smells of the Londoner.’ Lo and behold, when I looked up, we were round the back of the hotel off Leicester Square. Incredible marketing/branding - it definitely made me want to step in for another stay!",5,2024,07,21
141,Loved the Londoner!,"The experience was fantastic!
Olivier and Gabrielle were excellent!  One of our family members is disabled and they were accommodating, caring, friendly and made our first visit to London easy. 
The breakfasts, spa, pool and gym were first class!",5,2024,07,20
141,Extremely pleasant,"Beautiful unique hotel with the best hotel gym I have ever seen. Squat racks, Smith machine, multiple benches, cables with various attachments, kettlebells, Olympic bars, trap bar, weights exceeding 400 kg and two sets of dumbbells ranging from 5 kg up to 38 kg. It had a separate room for stretching, abs etc and bikes and treadmills if you're into cardio. Better than a lot of commercial gyms I have been to. there is also a pool, sauna and steam room for recovery. A special shoutout to Olivier the breakfast manager, who is quite possibly the nicest guy we have ever met and is an asset to the Londoner! We will be back to see him and the gym in the future.",5,2024,07,19
141,Could be great,"This hotel has everything to great but chooses not to elevate itself
to this standard. With rules like closing the FULL lobby bar at 10h30 at the same time as the rooftop bar and any other option in the hotel 3 days in a row is mindboggling.
There are always rules as to why they can't do this or that. But no one ever told us what they can do for us. Gave you a very kind 4 but at the price you charge you need to elevate your game. And I'm not going to rant about the restaurant and the rooms.
I ve said enough",4,2024,07,17
141,Fabulous Service with a Personal Touch,"We would be remiss if we didn't share a few highlights of our lovely time at the Londoner Hotel. First off, the staff was superb. Tom with the concierge team was simply sensational, sharing his knowledge of London AND PARIS. He could not have been more helpful. What an ideal ambassador for the hotel and by extension, for London. Also, had we not spoken at length with Calantha, we would not have actually believed how dedicated to service The Londoner is. At every station, we were greeted with kindness and willingness to be of service. Worthy of special praise, Calantha exemplified high-touch professionalism and creative leadership. I'd guess she can speak to anyone about anything -- from the window washer to the King -- and tthey would walk away feeling great about themselves ... and The Londoner. If we were in the hospitality business, we would do our level best to hire Calantha away.",5,2024,07,17
141,Trendy,"Hotel is modern and very clean. Location at Leicester Square is busy, close to restaurants, shopping, theatre and entertainment venues and tube. Kings guards, Big Ben, London eye and Buckingham all within walking distance. Enjoyed relaxing around the pool, breakfast is very good and also the staff.",5,2024,07,14
141,"perfect hotel with amazing service, great food and incredible location","This hotel is incredible... we spend 3 nights here and were treated like royalty. The common spaces are beautifully designed, and really feel like spaces you want to spend time, rather than just pass through. The restaurant for breakfast was a really bright and welcoming space, with a very sophisticated high end breakfast offering. the service was impeccable. The rooms are truly stunning- incredible views over all the main sites of london, with plenty of space, very comfortable beds and luxury bathrooms and amenities. Again, rooms that you really want to spend time in! The spa is a real sanctuary and was very well managed...  The location is perfect - right in the heart of london but with a total feeling of calm as you walk through the hotel doors. You have soho and covent garden on your doorstep and other attractions very close. 

I will be staying at the Londoner again!",5,2024,07,11
141,If Selfridges did a hotel,"If Selfridges did a hotel, it would be the Londoner! 
There are plenty of luxury hotels in London: four seasons, the rosewood but they are all a bit stuffy. Londoner delivers the same level of luxury but in a cool way. 

Considering the hotel was fully occupied and 350 rooms, I am amazed how quiet it felt and how quickly the elevators arrived (some sort of magic!!!) 

as a competitive weightlifter, I was impressed with the gym and 15 kg bars. However there is no place to snatch. 

The guest lounge is superb!",5,2024,07,11
141,Service outstanding,"We scoured the reviews to find the right hotel for a couples vacation and have to say we were so pleased we chose the Londoner.  Though the rooms are a bit small, but typical for Europe, the staff is super attentive to everything you could possibly want.  The concierge staff was amazing, with excellent recommendations for dinner (Fumo, yum) and show tickets (thumbs up for MJ the musical, one of the best we’ve seen).  Front desk, bar and restaurant staff super accommodating. The hotel is in prime location and that’s a plus too.  Definitely would recommend!",5,2024,07,10
141,Excellent stay,"The Londoner was a bit of a ""splurge"" booking but wanted to stay in a ""nice"" hotel for my first time in London. While Leicester Square may be touristy I appreciated the proximity to the theatre district as well as public transportation. The hotel blew me away in many aspects. The staff was so kind and attentive. All smiles; greeted us whenever walked in/out; never had to hold or open the door even once to the hotel from the street. The aesthetic of the hotel is divine--it really does feel like a retreat. The calming aromatherapy in the lobby will meet you after a day of adventuring and envelope you into a sense of calm. Despite being in an amazing city I could see myself returning and treating myself to a day solely inside the hotel as there is so much on offer. Dining options were all fabulous and of high quality. The room was very clean and housekeeping had good attention to detail. The hotel staff was so kind and offered us assistance with getting in contact with our airline after our bags were lost in the journey. Any request, big or small, was met with smiles and efficiency. I truly feel the hotel is worth the cost and I have sincere intent to stay again on my future visits to London.",5,2024,07,08
141,Hotel for a party - not for a luxury stay!,"Was really excited to stay at this hotel after seeing videos online of the spa area… we have stayed at many of the 5 star hotels in London but this one has turned out to be the biggest disappointment. When you think 5 star, you think luxury - not a cheap feeling place with everyone walking in off the streets after too many drinks, making the entrance loud and chaotic. 

When we arrived at the hotel at 3pm, our room was still not ready - which wasn’t an impressive start. The reception desk staff however were very polite and friendly and offered a welcome drink whilst we wait (the friendliness of the front desk staff I must say was pleasant and we have no complaints on this). As you walk in, you are met with the reception desk and a bar - both which where very busy which wasn’t a problem - but we very quickly noticed the amount of footfall coming through the hotel from outside, unsure if everyone was guests or there to use the bar, but it made it feel like a stop by for all the drunks. When our room was ready we was shocked at the size - at £650 a night you’d expect a space big enough for two people to move around but it was very crammed, making it too uncomfortable to enjoy any time in the room. 

The room was clean and was even cleaned again whilst we were out in the evening which was really appreciated. The bed was also very comfortable and the shower was pleasant. Our night was however ruined by loud knocking and shouting on our room door at 4am! After ignoring this to begin with, half asleep thinking I must be going mad, the knocks and shouting continued to which I woke my partner up who went to see what was happening - worried there was some sort of hotel emergency - nope. A bunch of drunk girls making loads of noise outside the room and banging on the door. We did mention this to reception in the morning who informed us, we could have called the night manager - but at 4am we wasn’t really wanting to get dressed and be up to make phone calls - we can understand that the girls behaviour is not a fault of the hotels - but I don’t know any other 5 star hotel that would tolerate this for people to even dare act in such a manner. 

Finally, the pool / spa that we was looking forward too soo much was very disappointing. We called ahead to reserve a bed / slot and was told we didn’t need to and to just head down - we head down to find everything reserved? So we was completely mislead. After sitting on beanbags for a short while my partner  decided to find a member of staff to speak to about it and managed to get us a bed. The pool was smaller than it looked online and the staff were pretty absent- when we did manage to order some smoothies I think it took around 40 mins to arrive! 

Overall, I think this is a great hotel if you would like to use it after a night out drinking and can justify the cost - but for us, we were just expecting a bit more luxury.",2,2024,07,07
141,Amazing location.,This hotel offers an amazing location to everything you need to get to in London ifyou are tourist. The doorman Kieran is amazing.  The staff are very hospitable and try to accommodate your every need. I took one star away as the lighting in the room is very dim and not efficient to put on make up.,4,2024,07,04
141,A brilliant hotel,"This hotel scores top on all points. As soon as and every time we entered the door we were greeted by the friendliest staff who were always there in numbers and ready to assist. The atmosphere in the lobby is such you don’t want to leave. Brilliant lighting and acoustics with a great bar and live beautiful music. The floors are beautifully decorated with lovely lit and interesting art hanging, the room was beautifully decorated and the bathroom great. The bed was heavenly and the room was quiet. You would never know the hustle and bustle of Soho is right in the doorstep. The breakfast room and service there is excellent. This place has a certain magic to it and is simply more comfortable than one could expect of any hotel. Thank you and congratulations!",5,2024,07,03
141,One night stop,"We stayed here on a whistle stop night out in London.
The hotel is right in the centre and a brilliant location, all the hustle and bustle but when you walk through the doors it is like you have stepped into another world.
The calm is lovely and you are greeted by super friendly staff and a very beautiful hotel.
It has all the luxuries and amenities required.
Will definitely be back.",5,2024,06,29
141,A Calm Oasis in the Heart of London,"I first stayed at the Londoner in August 2023 and I loved it so much I decided to return for my April 2024 trip to London. I was very skeptical of staying in Leicester Square because it's so crowded. Being from NYC, I was concerned it would be like staying in the heart of Times Square. But, as soon as you enter the lobby, it's total peace and quiet. I don't know how they do it. 

The central location is amazing for going to the theater, shopping, or getting public transportation to other parts of the city. The discount theater tickets booth is just steps from the front door and most of the theaters are within a 10min walk. 

I booked through Amex FHR and was given a lovely Deluxe King with a view of the London Eye.

My favorite feature is the Residence, a bar and lounge one level above the lobby that is exclusively for hotel guests. They have complementary soft drinks, tea, and coffee that is beautifully served. They also have food and alcohol available for purchase. I loved going for a glass of wine or tea in the evening rather than just sitting in the room. The Residence was never overcrowded and had a very relaxing vibe.

The attached restaurant is pretty good. Breakfast is ok, but I wouldn't pay for the buffet if it wasn't part of my room rate. 

I will definitely return next time I'm in London.",5,2024,06,27
141,This was perfect in so many ways,"We have spent 6 weeks traveling through Europe and the UK and this was by far the best hotel we have stayed in for this trip, upon arrival we were greeted by friendly doormen, helpful and lovely checking staff and generally the ambience, smell and decor of the foyer was refreshing and relaxing and so lovely. Check in was easy and the staff were friendly and efficient and then the happiness started. The lifts were quiet and very efficient with barely any waiting required. Our room was … can I say ‘perfect’. Pristine, clean and decorated so beautifully. The towels were large, fluffy and changed twice daily if needed. The bathrooms had ample supplies of everything you could need and the robes and slippers were soft and fluffy and added to the luxury of the room. The shower was easy to adjust and great pressure and terrific exhaust so the room stayed fresh all the time. I can barely talk about the beds without wanting to fall asleep.. the comfortable large bed, the crisp wonderful linen and the dreamy pillows and duvet made for a perfect nights sleep every time our heads hit the pillow. there were so many little extras that I just can’t list them all but without a doubt this will be the best hotel you will stay in so do yourself a favor snd def stay here. Thanks so much to every staff member of The Londoner  for making this part of our trip so perfect.",5,2024,06,27
141,Disappointing expected better,"Beautiful hotel, but to reliant on smart technology that doesn’t always work. And no backup. Customer service is surprisingly poor as they don’t follow through and several staff are not friendly. I had to repeatedly ask for the room to be made up for two. I tried for a few days to get the apps on the TV to work that track your stay and is the only source for hotel information. Never happened and on day 3 of 5. When I arrived they misplaced luggage, and didn’t seem concerned. It’s just the overall lack of attention to detail and friendliness, I don’t find them to be very friendly here or eager to take any accountability. There are many hotels in London that I’ve stayed at before that do a fantastic job with customer service. Unfortunately, I cannot include the Londoner in that category.",2,2024,06,23
141,Faultless.  Wonderful place to stay.,"Absolutely faultless. A 6+ star place to stay. From the moment you enter the Londoner you are greeted professionally and warmly and experience hospitality and rooms beyond compare. Pricey, but you well and truly get what you pay for. Well worth it in all respects.",5,2024,06,23
141,Visiting the Londoner Hotel is always an excellent experience!,"Visiting the Londoner Hotel is always an excellent experience!
My partner and I have been there multiple times, and this visit was to celebrate my 50th birthday. It was remarkable as the staff went above and beyond to make it a fantastic celebration.
We were welcomed with a drink at the lobby bar and upgraded to a larger room overlooking the London Eye and the Parliament.
We especially want to say a special thanks to the adorable bartender of Joshua's Tavern - Gin Bar, Ylli for the outstanding service provided hosting our evening and for accommodating my friend's special request for an expresso martini.
A main highlight of the hotel is its inviting lobby bar with live music, along with the impressive swimming pool, gym, and sauna for guests to enjoy at this fantastic location.
We also enjoyed the rooftop bar's views of the city and its hospitality while enjoying a glass of wine. In particular, we would like to thank Moeme, who provided exceptional service throughout our experience at the rooftop bar.
Overall, I would rate the hotel 5+ stars, especially for the outstanding service from Ylli and Moeme.",5,2024,06,19
141,So much to love!!,"What an unexpected joy! This was our first time at the Londoner… and we’ll be back! To start, the location is perfect. But there’s so much more! 
- Fabulous staff (particular kudos to the GM evening staff & concierge Leo)
- Remarkable lounge/bar exclusively for hotel guests. A cozy, comfortable, lovely spot to relax any time of the day with a beverage and small bites. Totally delightful!! 
- Terrific gym & spa. We enjoyed several spa treatments of a quality FAR beyond the typical hotel spa!! The staff there were amazing too.
- Pool area that invites deep, peaceful relaxation. (We might suggest some “adult only” hours for the pool, or maybe block off a small area for lap swimming?)
- Gorgeous lobby music with top notch musicians. I honestly thought one guy was John Legend! 
- Comfy bed, pillows (and I’m a persnickety pillow person! 😆)
- Cool decor throughout 
- Cool rooftop area with terrific views and a great range of seating options 

Just a few comments or suggestions:
- Add a magnifying mirror in the guest bathrooms
- Test guest room lights to make sure all the controls work (even with our range of experiences in many countries/hotels, we found the lighting system quite confusing)
- Ask the morning guy in the GM lounge to be a bit more polite to guests (maybe he was just having a bad day, but when I asked for a cappuccino, he looked quite pained/annoyed.) 
- Be aware that the closet hanging space is very small (about 15” wide). This wasn’t an issue for us, but might be for some guests.",5,2024,06,19
141,Fabulous,Fabulous stay for a 2 night break with a friend. The pillows and bed were the comfiest I have ever slept on. Despite being a central location I never heard any noise either outside or within the hotel. A lovely welcome by reception and all staff extremely helpful and friendly. Wouldn’t hesitate to recommend or stay again.,5,2024,06,17
141,Best hotel,"We are a family of 4.
This is our first time in the hotel.

The breakfast staff are very nice especially Ripon that gave us the best filling.
We will definitely return to the Londoner in our next trip to London ❤️",5,2024,06,13
141,A heartbreaking experience,"I am really disappointed and in fact furious with the “service” that Londoner hotel is providing.  I will explain the reason as below. 

We are staying in the Londoner because there is a global conference event held in the hotel. My husband and I were having breakfast in the hotel. The waitress passed a super hot plate to him to hold without any warning. Of course his fingers are burn. Immediately he jumped up and ran to the bathroom to cool down with water. 

When he is back, the manager of the restaurant stopped him from coming back to the dining room. My husband asked him for ice because the water is not helping. The manager refused and said she must inspect the wound first, despite that my husband in pain. When she saw my husband’s hand all red, that’s when she realise he is not faking and changed her face. But she kept him waiting, so I told him better use the ice in the champagne buckles next to him first to decrease the damage and he did. The manager came out shaking her head and immediately filled a bucket of ice and passed to us. But it is obvious she did it so we won’t make a scene in the bar.

The security finally came with first aid cooling (after 15 minutes waiting) . But I don’t understand why can’t the restaurant offer cream for burnt skin. And the most shocking is that the manager of the restaurant is totally indifferent with the whole situation. 

Instead of being welcomed in London, we feel really disappointed and discriminated. My husband ask how can trust trip advisor for the reviews if this is how a 5 star hotel with trip advisor reward  for the year acts. London is a beautiful city but we might not want to visit UK again because it seems to me Chinese are not welcomed here.

我真的很失望，事實上，對倫敦酒店提供的「服務」感到憤怒。  我將在下面解釋原因。 

我們住在倫敦人酒店，因為酒店正在舉辦全球會議活動。我和先生在飯店吃早餐。女服務生毫無預警地將一個超級熱的盤子遞給他，讓他拿著。當然，他的手指被燒傷了。他立刻跳起來，跑到浴室去喝水降溫。 

當他回來時，餐廳的經理阻止了他再回到餐廳。我先生向他要冰塊，因為水沒有幫助。經理拒絕了，並說她必須先檢查傷口，儘管我丈夫很痛苦。當她看到我先生的手都紅了的時候，她才意識到他不是裝的，臉色也變了。但她讓他等了很久，所以我告訴他最好先用旁邊香檳扣裡的冰塊來減少傷害，他照做了。經理出來搖頭，立刻裝了一桶冰，遞給我們。但很明顯是她這麼做的，所以我們不會在酒吧大吵大鬧。

保全終於帶著急救降溫來了（等了15分鐘後）。但我不明白為什麼餐廳不能提供治療燒傷皮膚的霜。而最令人震驚的是，餐廳的經理對整個情況完全漠不關心。 

我們在倫敦沒有受到歡迎，反而感到非常失望和歧視。我先生問，如果這是一家擁有年度旅遊顧問獎勵的五星級飯店，如何相信旅遊顧問的評論。倫敦是一個美麗的城市，但我們可能不想再訪問英國，因為在我看來，中國人在這裡不受歡迎。",1,2024,06,12
141,The most perfect weekend away,"What a wonderful experience it was being able to spend 2 nights at this beautiful hotel. 
From the first moment arriving at the door you are greeted with a wonderful smile from the doorman, you then arrive into what I can only describe as the most luxurious open space with decor that makes you feel so warm and welcome. 
We arrived quite early to hotel so we expected to leave our bags with concierge, but we were surprised when we were informed our room was ready, we were escorted to our room and explained in detail where everything was in the hotel. 
We wanted to take advantage of all the areas whilst there, we had the opportunity to eat delicious food at Whitcombs, drink amazing cocktails and listen to a wonderful DJ in the Shima Garden, have afternoon tea at the stage,  enjoy some relaxation at the spa and of course enjoy the wonderful residence space with complimentary snacks and drinks. Every member of staff were friendly, happy and held a lot of knowledge within the area they were working. 
We have been through some really tough personal times lately, so we can only thank you for giving us the most  wonderful weekend with joy and happiness. 
We are already looking at dates to come back around Christmas as it’s the perfect location for a romantic get away.",5,2024,06,11
141,"The Londoner Hotel (Fabulous,  thank you Olivier and Teodora, for making our stay so memorable) 💕🥂","Once again an excellent stay at this stunning hotel. 
We are met with smiles, and remembering us, they welcome us to our second home, as they like to tell us. 

Must say the attention we get from Olivier and Teodora is exceptional. 
They really are the heart beat of this hotel.
The staff are amazing, nothing too much trouble. 

The breakfast buffet has an excellent choice and staff again,  are amazing, a very well run section indeed! Run with precision and perfection. 

We stay at various hotel around the World , and only stay at The Londoner,  when we are in London. 

Thank you, to all the team of workers, that keep this hotel one of the best.",5,2024,06,11
141,Understated luxury in the heart of London,"I was fortunate enough to stay here the night of June 10th. My room was fantastic,  an unasked for upgrade. Comfortable,  beautifully appointed, and super stylish. I'm not sure I have stayed in a nicer hotel. Thanks to all the team. I hope I will have the chance to stay again soon!!",5,2024,06,10
141,Great hotel great experience!,"What a great luxury boutique hotel. when I asked, what does it mean to be a boutique hotel, the response I got was to customize the experience for every guest, wow what a great response. 

Everything in this hotel is new, very well appointed. a lot of times when I stay in boutique hotels, they are quiet, this hotel has such a great vibe to it, you feel the energy. 

Everyone I met there was fantastic, but I want to highlight Tomas. Do you want above and beyond. 

If you're going to London, and you want a great experience and a totally amazing hotel this is the one.",5,2024,06,09
141,I can’t wait to go back!! Loved The Londoner!!,"The best location, fabulous service and the most beautiful and comfortable rooms! The food is amazing and the staff is all top notch!!  We went as a girls trip had a blast! Great shopping & dinning all walking distance. I can’t wait to return to The Londoner!!",5,2024,06,08
141,Disappointing Experience: Unsanitary Conditions and Questionable Practices,"The Londoner's positive reviews and proximity to the theater initially attracted us, but our stay was marred by slightly concerning incidents. Upon check-in, we received welcome drinks, but my husband found a long black hair in his beverage, which was neither of ours. While accidents happen, it was unappetizing.

Furthermore, when we went to use the bathtub, we discovered more hair of the same color, raising hygiene concerns before we even utilized the facilities. We were offered a free drinks voucher as well, but we declined to use it, apprehensive about potential contamination.

The most unsettling aspect was the voluntary request for a £30 ""housekeeping fee"" upon checkout. This practice is highly unusual, especially considering the hotel's purported luxury status. Even prestigious establishments like The Ritz do not impose such charges.

Overall, the experience fell short of our expectations, and the unsanitary conditions, combined with the questionable voluntary housekeeping fee request, left us dissatisfied. For the price paid, we would have preferred a more affordable option like the Mercure, where breakfast is included, providing better value for money.",2,2024,06,06
141,Fantastic service,"First of all, many thanks to excellent service from Krystal, Katrina, Fiona and Yan. Here you can feel an unparalleled sense of luxury. Whether it's fashionable decoration or thoughtful service, you can feel the luxurious experience of being in it. For those of you who love photography, this is an excellent place to take photos! Every corner has a stunning background, ensuring that you take stunning photos. Moreover, the cuisine here is also unique, especially the thoughtful and considerate service from Yan is fantastic! No matter what flavor you like, you can find satisfaction here! In short, the Londoner Hotel Macau is not only a good place to stay, but also a fashionable paradise! If you don't believe it, come and experience it yourself!",5,2024,06,04
141,A wonderful stay and would highly recommend!,"What a wonderful experience it was staying at the Londoner. From location, check-in, to the retreat and the spa, there’s a lot to like about staying at this hotel! 
The staff are so helpful and accommodating and the rooms are wonderful. I especially loved the Retreat which is a place where you can go and enjoy tea, coffe, soft beverages and snacks complimentry if you are a resident at the hotel. The spa was beautiful with very welcoming, friendly staff. 
I can’t wait to go back!",5,2024,06,02
141,"My favorite place to stay , it's the people and the place that earn 5 stars!","I ADORE this hotel. The first time I found it, was because of a recommendation from AMEX, I have stayed here 5 time since, and it's the only place I want to stay. I'm a person who likes consistency, impeccable service no matter the hour, the homely feel but to a high standard, the Londoner is it. In the last year, I've been greeted by the same overly helpful and friendly faces at the front desk, who always accommodate. 
Breakfast and Olivier (Whitcomb's manager) are one of my top three favorite things about this hotel. Olivier ALWAYS makes guests feel like family and quite accommodating (sometimes I travel for business other times with family, including my son) making each time enjoyable. Sometimes I go to breakfast just to chat with him! The pool/spa/gym area, is a sanctuary in itself. No matter what the weather is inside you will feel serenity in this area. Third favorite is tied with the rooms and location (although they compliment each other) many rooms have great views of the Square but also feel chic and are cozy with enough space. During my stays I have left a crucial hard rive which everyone from Olivier to the front desk went out of their way to track down and mail to me (in Los Angeles), I've arrived after stolen luggage and they were quite accommodating to help me to the shops, and I've come with my family, and they gave everyone the same attention I look forward to. It's easy to feel at home here.",5,2024,05,29
141,Best Hotel in London!! Six Star Service!,"The best service in London, hands down. From the check in process, to the room service, to the restaurants and selection of food. Super central, great rooms. I’ve not been this pampered by a hotel in ages. Well done team. Well done. If six stars existed!",5,2024,05,28
141,Poor,"Great gym and spa and live music on the weekends

But it’s a hotel that’s trying to do a lot but failing

Do not visit if you have even the slightest dietary need. 

I was told that they couldn’t even offer olives at the bar because of risk of cross contamination. I wasn’t sure whether that was because of lack of protocols in kitchen or they’re hiding behind that statement. With that attitude we wouldn’t be going back. There are enough hotels in London that go above and beyond to cater vs this one that can’t do the bare minimum. 

They have very little attention to small details at that calibre of a hotel. Even th loose leaf peppermint tea was a sham. You have to try it to know. Don’t bother about doorman helping you with the bags on a quiet time when there’s no one else that needs his help.",2,2024,05,28
141,Fantastic Hotel in Great Location for a short stay,"Beautiful contemporary hotel in the heart of London, perfect location for theatre land and walking around in the city. 
Friendly staff, extremely comfortable beds, quiet peaceful rooms and good powerful showers.  I guess the Toto loos are worth a mention too! 
We felt there was not quite enough storage in the king room for more than a 2 night stay, extra shelves or drawers would have been welcomed.  Lack of space by the kettle/ tea/coffee tray making it rather difficult when making a cuppa. 
One thing that is disappointing is that the staff are changing the towels daily, not at all environmentally friendly in this particular situation, no option given to indicate we would be happy to reuse.  Additional drying rail(s) for towels would be appreciated.
We enjoyed dinner on the 8th floor, however for a sharing dining experience we felt the tables were too small and the music too loud!",4,2024,05,27
141,Work related trip,"Super comfortable beds, excellent staff and beautiful building. Brilliant location, just wish could of stayed longer. The only downside we had we purchased an umbrella but when we got home the shaft was split we contacted the hotel who said they would replace but nothing .",5,2024,05,27
141,An accomplished Hotel that sets up he standard for care and empathy .,"The Londoner has grown into its own skin over the last two years, especially. Beautifully situated on the edge of Leister Square and yet none of the noise from the outside  permeates within.
The cuisine at the restaurant and room service especially is outstanding. And the spa is beautifully appointed with a gorgeous pool and immaculate service. The management are superb and the attendance and care and considered hospitality is a stand out . I highly recommend you go.",5,2024,05,25
141,Bad experience on checkout,"Stayed here on special celebratory weekend.
Staff were ok until we went to check out, (awful experience)
They tried to charge me for breakfass that was already included. 
Staff member was adamant she’s was right even thou I showed her my original booking confirmation.
A manager was called who proceeded to remove the breakfast from the bill. 
After recalculating and printing off the new bill I checked it and returned as it was still wrong by a huge amount. 
This time I had a new member of staff who was questioning me on my calculation and now proceeded to manually work out the bill. 
He eventually arrived at my figure and apologies which was something. 
It turned out that the original member of staff had not used the reduce room rates and went off the original price which would have cost me £120 more for the two nights 
The breakfasts are £30 each per night, they are not worth that I can assure you. 

I did receive an apology from the hotel manager by e-mail after I had written a formal complaint. 
The upshot of this was they offered us a returned stay at a preferential room rate.
Unfortunately thou we felt our weekend experience ended on such a bed note that they didn’t deserve our money again and didn’t want to risk another disappointment.",3,2024,05,25
141,In the Middle of West End London Action,"I traveled with a theatre group from Virginia, USA to experience London theatre.  The Londoner Hotel on Leicester Square was arranged by our group's manager and is perfectly located to explore the West End its theatres, museums, restaurants and shopping. The hotel is modern, chic, beautifully appointed and it too is worth exploring.

Upon entrance to the hotel, with the crowds of people on the Square. I initially thought that noise would be a problem but it was not.  The hotel is an oasis that was good to return to after a full day of touring, sightseeing, dining, cruising and theatre going.

The staff was excellent in all respects.  Every question was fully answered.  Every concern was resolved quickly and professionally.  Laca and Tie (I hope I spelled their names correctly) at the concierge stand were generous with their time and expert advice and directions.

I never expect a hotel room in the UK or anywhere in Europe to be the size of American hotel rooms so when the room is a decent size I'm pleased.  I don't share my room, so my perspective of the roominess of my Londoner Hotel room won't agree with everyone else's. I had a king sized room, with a small sofa lounge area; access to a shared internal terrace space (where we attended an event); and a tub was included in the shower room. I was able to adjust my thermostat and make the room a bit warmer.  My bed was comfortable and I slept well every evening.  There is live entertainment on the first level but it is over by 11-midnight so that did not pose a problem for me.

The room was appointed with all the amenities one comes to expect (e.g., hairdryer, fluffy robes and house slippers, coffee/tea station and toiletries) and the unexpected ""Mr. Toto"" warm-seat, automatic toilet! Breakfast and access to The Residence were complementary to our rooms. 

I pre-arranged for a taxi to the airport after breakfast when I departed on 12 May and that service was also prompt and a stress-free experience with the doorman Rado (again I hope I remembered his name correctly) escorting us and our luggage to meet the taxi.",5,2024,05,22
141,Disappointing 5 star experience,Considering it was a 5 star hotel I expected the customer service to be better. I did not feel welcomed and felt the staff spoke to my male partner instead of myself as the female lead booker. Whilst the facilities were good with pool and the resident rooms the room we stayed in was not as spacious as expected and could not dry hair in front of a mirror as no sockets close enough. Wouldn’t recommend especially as was expensive and supposed to be a treat.,3,2024,05,19
141,Perfect hotel in the heart of London,Gorgeous hotel in the heart of Leicester Square.  Lots of staff on hand at all times.  Helpful polite.  Rooms are beautiful with the Japanese toilet to add a bit of luxury! All we would say is don’t stay on the 7th floor.  Particularly noisy with the DJ from the roof top bar above.  Rang down at 10.30pm though and got moved straight away! Can’t complain with the service.  There is a nice pool spa area and also a residents only area where you can enjoy complimentary tea coffee and soft drinks and a few snacks.,5,2024,05,19
141,Luxurious stay in an excellent location,"Our stay at the Londoner was one of the best hotel stays we have had on a city break. The room was immaculate and had little details that made it feel like true luxury. We tried both the A la Carte Mediterranean restaurant and the lounge bar and although considerably more pricey than surrounding bars and restaurants the food, service and atmosphere makes it completely worth it. Would definitely return in the future should be decide to visit London’s theatre district again",5,2024,05,16
141,"Cozy, ultra comfortable, sleep tight!","Think no more if you all you have in mind is a coooozzzzyyy stay!!
Assuring you a welcoming stay, smiles all your way, this place has literally canvassed my heart and is definitely a hotspot if you are looking for a city view stay in London!
No fancy words, pure experience!!",5,2024,05,15
141,Lovely stay!,"The Londoner is a beautiful hotel in an excellent location for walking to theaters, dinner, museums and shopping.  The area itself is hectic and busy, but once inside the hotel, it is very peaceful.  The residence area for guests to relax and have refreshments is a brilliant and appreciated concept.  Room service 24 hours is wonderful, especially for those of us on east coast US time.  My spa service with Nessarah was exceptional.  A comfortable bed and plush towels also made the stay enjoyable.  

I did have a couple of service issues.  My minibar was not working, and I never received a replacement.  I had to call twice for a bucket of ice because the first request was lost.  There were a couple of issues at checkout, but we resolved those via email.  Despite these issues, I found most of the staff to be quite kind and helpful,   I look forward to returning to the Londoner on my next trip.",5,2024,05,14
141,"Excellent location, service and taste","Perfectly located in the theater district, close to restaurants, cafés and activities, the hotel is suitable for both business trips and family visits.
Comfortable rooms and impeccable service and many dining options.
Fun fact: the high-tech toilet!",5,2024,05,13
141,Convenient location; nice finishes/common areas; very small rooms,"My partner and I had a positive experience at The Londoner and would come back.

The hotel's location is quite central being on Leicester Square, although the immediate area is quite hectic/touristy given its proximity to Piccadilly Circus. That said, it's a convenient location for all the major West End attractions/neighborhoods. The entrance to the hotel is on the square, not the road, which is a bit unusual. 

The rooms look/feel very new and have nice finishes; bed was very comfortable. The hotel rooms are very small (maybe this is typical for London, but this seemed really really small to us). We were in a Deluxe King, and there was a small closet, one drawer, and barely room to lay out suitcases in the room unless you want to use the couch/chair. The bathroom is not a separate room and is actually built into the hallway (not the best for privacy if that's important to you). Overall, super nice room, however the size might be challenging for some people...The photos on the hotel website are a little dishonest in terms of room size. The anti-Tory art in the bathroom is kinda weird too...

The hotel's common areas are excellent, with a fantastic gym and indoor pool and great lobby ambience. The lobby and second floor are great for working remotely and the complimentary tea service is awesome. 

Hotel food is good but not great, it's worth using your dining credit if you have one but otherwise I recommend venturing out to local restaurants outside of the Piccadilly Circus area. Service is a bit hit or miss but overall was good. My main complaint on the food was the in-room dining dessert options, which are overly formal/European, needs something like cookies/ice cream for late night.",4,2024,05,08
141,Our New London Favorite!,"From the moment we arrived we were immediately met by Henry, who had the most incredible smile and welcoming manner. We knew this was going to be our new home away from home for our annual visit to London.

The Londoner has all the latest conveniences in a warm and friendly environment.  The staff is perfectly trained under the leadership of Mr Simon Wong, the General Manager, and Mr Singh the owner and Chairman. Together, they have set a tone of excellence and graciousness in this exquisitely -designed property in Leicester Square. 

The rooms are dramatic with warm and stylish colors and the latest in smart automation down to the Toto automatic washlets and push-button bath and showers controls. 

Whitcomb’s hosts a terrific breakfast to start your morning with delicately -prepared omelets, espresso coffees, and a broad array of cold choices. 

8 at The Londoner — the rooftop bar and restaurant — sports a panoramic view from the London Eye, past Nelson’s Column to Parliament, and across the Thames to Battersea. Book your reservation early since it’s extremely popular. The Gyoza Tacos are a must!

With more features than this review will permit, I invite you to visit their website and book a week at The Londoner.  This will soon become your home away from home, too!",5,2024,05,08
141,A perfect hotel ,"What a fantastic hotel, everything was perfect, especially the service in the restaurant, Olivier was exceptional!!!!!

141,Great stay 👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼,"Stayed last night due to visiting for Bank holiday weekend. Rooms very nice and luxurious. 
Sunday lunch was great and with champagne and wine, just hit the spot. Then went into the bar area to listen to the gentleman playing the piano which was a great afternoon. 
Checkin was simple and with a smile, as was check out. 
Staff recommended a local Indian restaurant for an evening meal, which was fabulous.
Overall a great hotel and would highly recommend staying.",5,2024,05,06
141,Best hotel to stay in London,"A very well managed hotel with phenomenal service by the staff. Room was very clean, modern controls with lots of amenities. The gym and spa is a hidden gem.  Whitecomb restaurant served great quality of food with top notch service. Thank you Olivier and your staff. The concierge team also did an excellent job with top notch service. Thank you Patrick and your team. . Their rooftop bar offers an excellent view of many of the London attractions. Its location is perfect for exploring London on foot. Walking distance to many attractions.  I walked to Trafalgar Square, BuckinghamPalace, Big Ben, St Shane’s Patk, Wellington Arch, Piccadilly, and many many more.    Oh, don’t miss their Residence lounge, a relaxing place for the clients    Thank you Kris for a wonderful tour of your facility including the Whiskey Room.  We really had a wonderful stay.",5,2024,05,03
141,Lovely hotel,"This is a beautiful hotel right in the middle of Leicester Sq. the rooms are not very spacious but the standard of hygiene and cleanliness is high. We stayed in the middle of Ramadan and we were grateful that our cereals were brought to us on time. We thank the food and beverage team for this. My only observation was the female reception staff whom we found very stuck up and not so friendly, this made it impossible to approach a few of them and I personally recommend that they revisit their behaviour and be mindful that this is not a catwalk. Otherwise I would recommend the hotel and we thank the entire house keeping team for all the efforts.",4,2024,04,24
141,A Month in Europe 5 Different Hotels. This Was The Worst,"AMEX Platinum experience. 
Pro 
1.We were greeted at the door
2.concierge was very kind and walked us to our room
3.Toilet is a TOTO which they are the best!
4.The shower was so nice
5. The tech in the room was really cool! 
6. Gym is 24hours and it was empty in the mornings.

Con 
1.I (female) booked the trip for me and my bf but all the welcome packages including the tv listed ""Welcome Mr. Sawyer"" When checking out, I stood in front of the concierge to check out but he kept conversation and reviewing charges to my boyfriend instead of me. First time I have ever experienced that. Even though I answered and it was my card on file. 
2.After a month of traveling we were hoping to just relaxed at the hotel and do spa treatment before heading home but the spa services are only available M-F. we were not aware, had we known we would have booked somewhere else. 
3. We tried to book for tea time but they told us they were booked for the weekend which was such a shame because we were only there Friday-Monday morning. Might be good to check with the hotel what is available before booking
4.First night we walked back to the hotel after a day of sight seeing and we tried to order dessert with tea. 30 mins passed and we still didn't have our dessert. When we asked the waiter, he said he had to clear it with the manager. We were not sure why but requested to have it send to our room instead. We received it 15mins later. 
5. We tried to sit at common space to work and order food around 12pm. The waiter never came by. After 30mins we left. Never ate there again. Not even for breakfast even though we get free breakfast with our platinum stay. 
6. There are no upgrades for Platinum. We didnt make a fuss or anything but you should be aware if you book through AMEX the room available for booking is the upgrade. 

Overall you can tell there was some deep rooted classism, sexism, and racism feel to this hotel. If you are not from UK and do not dress like old money you will have a hard time. If you are traveling the the US the staff looks at you like a poor peasant. I will like to add I have never in my life experienced this. Both my boyfriend and I are latinos and we both agreed this place made us feel incredibly out of place and unwelcome.",2,2024,04,23
141,The Londonder Staff We Love You!,"I have no words for this hotel. Second time staying here and it feels like home. What made this stay so welcoming was the service. The rooms were well equipped, clean, great gym, and the breakfast was to die for. If you’re dinning at the Whitecomb resturant ask for Oliver he will treat you like royalty. If you want to have a night in just go and enjoy the spa. Put on your robe and kick your feet back. Just take a moment to decompress here and order the cesar salad…have a taste of the chicken masala at 4 am. 

The staff became family at the end, lots of emotions leaving but we all exchanged kind words and hugs. All of them were so darling. There was no judging even if you came back at 4 am with an English man. We will be back! Hello London…goodbye London.

141,"Great hotel, wonderful staff, a few minor design issues re the room","PROs
A great hotel, with an incredible location on traffic-free Leicester Square. Staff universally friendly, warm and helpful. Particular thanks to Maitre d’ Olivier Secret for looking after us so warmly and charmingly. He seemed genuinely concerned when anyone was lacking a drink or something he noticed they needed. Truly wonderful, attentive and personal service. 

CONs
The room was attractive although with some eccentric design decisions (the toilet door opening into the tiny floor space rather than sliding made it quite difficult to use, the bath so shallow it was difficult to actually get wet, the ‘reading light’ setting blindingly bright). The gym is well provisioned with machines but each of the several times I worked out it was a mess, with weights all in the wrong places, towels discarded on the floors, and personal trainers working their either ignoring it or contributing to the mess. I gave feedback to the team after my first time using it, but no improvement was discernible. 

OVERALL
Despite the shortcomings, the service was so good, and the welcome so genuine, I would absolutely return. Please, hotel management, just make this place perfect by looking after the gym better and attending to the room features that don’t work so well.",5,2024,04,14
141,So many options!,"Stayed for one night in a city view room. The room was very modern, comfortable and clean. The Japanese style toilet was a great experience within itself, wish I had one at home!

There were multiple dining and drinking options, with each themed differently. We met with some colleagues on the Japanese rooftop terrace which was a lovely place to sit and enjoy a couple of drinks.

We then opted for a change of scenery and moved to some very comfortable seating indoors where we had some dishes from the varied menu. The food was delicious, in fact up there with the very best we have ever experienced in London, and the service was friendly, helpful and attentive. We had such a nice time that our planned couple of hours turned into four hours and quite a few more drinks and dishes.

In all, a very well located modern hotel, with great staff, facilities and dining options. I would certainly recommend a stay at The Londoner!",5,2024,04,14
141,Fantastic stay,Highly recommend this fantastic hotel! Went for a birthday trip and the attention to detail was fantastic! Birthday plate and nibbles left in the room to celebrate were a fantastic and boutique touch that not many hotels do anymore. The staff is extremely friendly and the service provided is superb. needless to say I will be back very soon!,5,2024,04,07
141,Great place !,Overall we had a great stay at the hotel . Staff is impressive ( really) . The hotel is very comfortable. Spa is great and so is breakfast. Easter holiday week end made the hotel very crowded which was unfortunate . And apart from the rather small room we loved our stay and might consider coming back.,5,2024,04,01
141,The nicest hotel we have stayed in.,"We had the most incredible stay at this hotel, the service was amazing and the hotel itself was absolutely gorgeous. The rooms are so spacious, we had a beautiful view and the spa was unreal. The only issue I had was my partner snored so loud so I slept in the bathtub… which by the way is actually very comfortable! 

We will definitely be visiting again soon!",5,2024,03,31
141,Hotel gym is only the beginning,"Booked the Londoner after searching online for good hotel gyms. The gym met my expectations and was exceptional, however this was surpassed by the professionalism and friendliness of the incredible hotel staff. It was such a delight to be greeted each morning at breakfast by the amazing team, particularly Olivier who helped ensure our food (omelets and sausages) was amazing and that our days were tremendous.
Will definitely be booking here again for our next visit to London.",5,2024,03,28
141,Not impressed,"The hotel is fantastic and the spa is amazing has amazing attention to detail. The door staff were amazing and always smiling.

Unfortunately this time around the stay wasn’t the greatest experience. 

The upper bar has a dj on a Saturday night and the bass from the music. Can be heard in the room until the small hours. As it echos around the courtyard open space to the rooms facing it. So just laid awake till 1:30. 

Rang the reception but they were rude and didn’t care. So visited downstairs to speak face to face but didn’t get any were we have checked the sound levels and there ok. At that stage I just wanted to pack up and leave the hotel. The staff were not 5star on the night and I have experienced better customer service at holiday inns and travel lodges.  Not the level of service you would expect from a hotel which advertised as 5star

In the morning on check out the gentleman who checked us out was amazing and totally understood. 

As to response from The Londoner on Google they blame the bars out side for the noise levels when it’s an internal problem 

So if you want a good night sleep on a Saturday bring ear plugs or book else we’re",1,2024,03,26
141,The best concierge team in London,"My experience with The Londoner hotel's was nothing short of exceptional! I found myself in a bit of a pickle, having my plan cancelled last minute.
The concierge team, led by Tom Wardley , truly went above and beyond to secure the perfect seats for me for The Sister Act musical opening night . Not only did they manage to find tickets for the show, but they also provided insightful recommendations on nearby dining options to complete the evening.

Their attention to detail and commitment to ensuring my experience was seamless was remarkable.

If you're ever in need of a last-minute theatre fix or any assistance during your stay, look no further than The Londoner's concierge team. They'll make sure your London experience is nothing short of magical.",5,2024,03,25
141,One of the best hotels in London,"I had a nice stay, staff went above and beyond to make my stay memorable. A special shoutout to Selbi and Alicia!

Rooms are equipped with everything you need, had turndown service every evening. I had welcome treats awaiting for me in the room which I think is a nice touch. 

Doormen and concierge also were nice and friendly. I will definitely be back.",5,2024,03,25
141,The very best staff!!!!,"Had the most memorable stay here! I felt so welcomed since I stepped in the hotel and greeted by everyone at the reception. Cassandra and Calantha were such a sweetheart. The concierge team was incredibly helpful and reachable 24/7! Berney and David gave me a lot of cool places to discover. The location of the hotel is 10/10 and can’t forget about the view of the Big ben from the restroom of my suite!!!
I had breakfast at the restaurant and also ordered room services and they’re both amazing. The lady at the breakfast (I can’t remember her name, sorry) was so lovely. I’d recommend anyone who visit London ti stay here. My stay was nothing short of exceptional!!!",5,2024,03,24
141,Luxurious but without the pomp !,"Amazing discovery and this will be our go to hotel on every London visit in the future. Luxurious yet not snooty or with any air of pomp. Staff were all amazing particularly Olivier in the Whitcomb’s restaurant who was so attentive. Rooms were exceedingly comfortable, clean and state of the art. There was nothing we could pinpoint that we weren’t happy about. We didn’t want to check out !",5,2024,03,24
141,Great hotel,"Great hotel attentive staff from the minute i checked in the staff was amazing, the ambiance was delightful and location was perfect close to activities but not too noisy. The gym is great, the spa a little confusing at first but great juice bar",5,2024,03,23
141,Excellent hotel- must try it!,"This is my third visit and each time gets better!
Highly recommend this hotel. I have stayed in several luxury hotels in London but this hotel offer so much. Great location, excellent staff, amazing food in all the bars and restaurants.  Rooms are a little smaller but I don’t spend much time in the room. Rooms spotless and lovely touches. 
All the staff are friendly and helpful and make you feel very special. 
Can’t wait to return in a couple of months.  It’s definitely going to be a regular hotel for me, so happy we tried it. Thank you",5,2024,03,22
141,A real diamond,"A beautiful contemporary hotel.  From the moment my husband and I walked into the lobby, until the moment we left everything was just perfect.
Our room was modern and extremely comfortable. Bed was bigger than usual, with extra large feather pillows…. heaven. Our bathroom had a powerful easy to use shower and a bath, we tried both. Easy to control  temperature in room which is always a plus. We found breakfast plentiful and there was a vast choice of hot or cold food. We also ate in Whitcomb’s food was delicious and beautifully presented. To end this review I would like to thank all the staff from reception, housekeeping, F&B etc for making our stay a really wonderful one.",5,2024,03,21
141,Excellent all round,"We stayed a night at The Londoner last Saturday - the experience was perfect and the staff went above and beyond to make sure we were well looked after in every way.

In particular, we would like to mention Olivier, front of house at Whitcomb's, who gave us a huge amount of help and local knowledge...we look forward to seeing you again!

Rohan, on the front desk was also extremely helpful...we ended up with access to the private whisky room for an impromptu photoshoot!

We hope to return in the near future...

141,Simply Excellent!,"Amazing experience, from the second the doors are opened. Very personal service and check in experience, with superb rooms. Super comfy bed and pillows and very nice bathroom facilities. Large pool, steam and sauna rooms with options for spa treatments. Live bands in the foyer at the main bar and restaurant. Worth every penny paid to stay at this fabulous, very modern and central location. That is certainly not all to mention, so I highly recommend staying here.",5,2024,03,19
141,Recommended,"We were really impressed with the outstanding customer service throughout our stay.  From the moment we arrived until the moment we left, *all* team members were considerate and helpful, and nothing was too much trouble.  

The Deluxe King City View room was very comfortable, with the in-room technology designed to be intuitive and user-friendly.  

The location was perfect and there was always something entertaining happening just outside in Leicester Square - hustle, bustle, street performers, etc.  Despite this, our room was quiet and peaceful.

The overall impression we were left with was of the friendliness of the staff and the customer focus of everyone we’d interacted with - from the doormen to the reception team to the breakfast team to the cleaning staff.  Thank you all for creating such an enjoyable and restful stay.",5,2024,03,18
141,Luxury and location,"We’ve just spent the weekend at The Londoner to celebrate my wife’s 40th birthday. We’ve had a super time - the hotel is beautiful, the staff friendly and helpful and it was just the right mix of elegance and atmosphere that we were looking for. The location was fantastic for the areas of London we wanted to explore and we made use of the spa every day which we really enjoyed. Live music in the lobby was great to walk into and the chocolates in the room for my wife’s birthday were a nice touch. Overall a great place that lived up to expectations. Highly recommended.",5,2024,03,18

141,"Not great, but certainly not bad","Brilliant location, lots to do in and around the hotel. But the stay could of definitely been a lot better as explained below.
Bad bits - Found hairs that weren't ours on the bed. The bath was really small especially for the level of room we got. Simple things like tissues weren't served at breakfast which was inconvenient. I know i should of just asked but we didnt want to disturb our waitor any further as we asked her at least 3x to refil our (very small) tea cups. Wish she just gave us a tea pot like the table next to us. But yes after calling her over 3-4x me and the misses just sucked up the messy fingers and just washed our hands when we went back to our rooms, but simple things like tissue should be served with your food, where in leicester square for gods sake. Very noisy at night considering these were ment to be soundproof rooms, the morning was even worst very loud but that was due to work outside (I.e bin men, work men & day to day go'ers) so probably out of the hotels control. Someone also accessed our room without our permission (although it was for a nice gesture to leave some complimentary anniversary treats) I think it would be nice to ask for access, once again I most definitely appreciated the gesture but some people are abit more strict regarding their privacy, may i suggest you have someone ask/tell one of the couple that you plan to do this (preferably the man). Also, not that it would be an issue for the majority of people staying in this area in a hotel like this, but after paying basically £500 for a room for the night, the £250 deposit on arrivak I was unaware off, I thought was a bit steep. After all that mentioned above, I was still asked when checking out if I want to leave a discretionary £13+ tip for there cleaners etc which i thought was a bit cheeky since my room had issues surrounding cleanliness. I was reluctant to pay it, but the embarrassment for their sake of me explaining why, I just paid it & shut up. Also I paid for a city view room. But there wasn't much of a city view lol.
Good bits - The temperature in the sauna and steam room was really low. We hardly broke a sweat. The pool and beds etc was lovely, lay out was lovely and the overall stay at the spa was great just wish the sauna and steam room was actually hot. It's open to a decent time in the evening. The rooftop bar is a nice touch for some cocktails and finger food also open late. Its in a great location to, so lots of good food choices on your front door and loads of stuff to go do out and about.
Overall I know it sounds like there was a lot more bad than good but I would definitely encourage someone to try it out for themselves & I would return, but for the price I paid which was a booking . Com deal of £480 which should of been over £540+ I would expect more for my money.",3,2024,03,08
141,A Symphony of Modern Luxury in the Heart of London,"The Londoner Hotel was our second accommodation during our recent trip to London, and in comparison to the previously mentioned classic London landmark, The Langham, this one truly represents the epitome of modern luxury.

This hotel came highly recommended by a friend who frequently travels to London for business. He claimed it to be his current favorite in the city, attributing its charm to its convenience, modernity, all while retaining the quintessential characteristics of London. 

Situated in Leicester Square in West London, right in the heart of Chinatown, with the National Gallery just behind it, the convenience is unparalleled. Whether you wish to catch a major musical, explore the British Museum (which I managed to reach on foot in about 15 minutes), everything is within walking distance.

The building's former life as a theater and the internal design by Yabu Studio contribute to a modern boutique hotel style. With numerous contemporary art pieces and captivating Cipher series lighting, the atmosphere is striking. I particularly admire the chic and unrestrained uniform worn by the staff, showcasing a thoughtful design.

I must commend the facilities here. Usually, even in luxurious European hotels, the amenities tend to feel somewhat outdated. Here, we find smart toilets, Dyson hairdryers, and intelligent remote-controlled switches, contributing to a sense of high-quality living. Additionally, the hotel is ideal for business travelers, with a 24-hour executive floor offering drinks and snacks for all guests. The basement hosts a spacious swimming pool and a gym.

Breakfast is featuring my favorite fresh fruit and vegetable juices. With a semi-buffet and semi à la carte setup, there are plenty of choices. We also tried their signature restaurant, Whitcomb's, a Mediterranean-themed dining experience. It's family-friendly with a kid's menu and provided coloring books, making it a great Western restaurant for families. Moreover, the prices are reasonable. I recommend trying the oysters and King prawns.

Upon further research, I discovered that this hotel has no affiliation with The Londoner in Macau. Instead, it's a local brand in London, part of Preferred Hotels & Resorts Legend ，What amazed me most is their commitment to sustainability – reportedly surpassing London's other hotels by 30% in sustainable standards. This includes the use of eco-friendly building materials, showerheads, and fragrances, making it truly commendable. 👍",5,2024,03,04
141,Incredible 5 star experience!!,"We returned to the hotel for a second time in Dec / Jan because we had the most amazing stay in April. The second visit was even bigger than the first (we didn’t think that was even possible) The staff are exceptional and we booked into the suite with incredible views for New Year’s Eve. It was hands down the best hotel stay we have had. 

The attention to detail from all the staff is wonderful, and the location is perfect. 

The manager Stelian was superb to deal with and went out of his way to make our stay a memorable one. 

Thank you for a wonderful stay!",5,2024,03,04

141,Fantastic experience from start to finish,"Absolutely flawless, have stayed at much more expensive hotels in London that don’t come close to this, spotlessly clean, incredible service, staff and the process is clearly incredibly well managed. Comfy beds, nice rooms, systems that work, lovely decor, incredible location. 

Genuinely couldn’t falt it! 

It’s extremely refreshing these days when you go somewhere nice and everything is as you expect, kudos to whoever is running it, you’re doing a cracking job!",5,2024,03,03
141,Stunning hotel - Birthday and NYE Trip,"I stayed at the Londoner for my birthday and NYE. 
The hotel is fantastic. The staff can’t do enough for you. It was our first stay here so the receptionist took the time to show us all the amenities the hotel has to offer. 
We were greeted with a glass of bubbles and a smile which always goes a long way.
The hotel had put balloons and champagne in my room for my birthday celebration to which was so thoughtful.
The rooms are spacious and very clean.
The bathrooms are amazing , with shower and bath. Along with a very snazzy toilet !!
The spa in the hotel is gorgeous, a little London sanitary. The spa staff were very attentive and made sure there was always room for everyone.
Breakfast is fantastic - loads to choose from and again the staff were on it. You don’t have to wait for a table or to order. Even at such a busy period. 
The overall vibe of the hotel is great. There was so much going on but not overwhelming.
Thanks for making my birthday special and we will be returning in the summer.",5,2024,03,02
141,Fantastic stay at The Londoner,"My husband & I stayed at The Londoner on the 23rd Feb as we were attending an awards event that evening at the hotel. We had never stayed here before and can categorically say we were pleasantly surprised. The outside did not do it justice but once you entered…. wow… stunning. The decor was beautiful, the atmosphere was welcoming and relaxed. The doorman/porter took our cases whilst we checked in. The receptionist was lovely, extremely informative and attentive. She left the desk to show us around eventually taking us to the residents lounge where we were served a glass of sparkling wine. Afterwards we went to our room on the 3rd floor. Again wow, gorgeous. Beautifully decorated, massive bed, white fluffy robes and slippers and large thick towels. My hubby was amazed by the Japanese style toilet with a heated seat !.  We attended the awards ceremony which was fabulous. Food amazing and again very attentive staff. We came down for breakfast the next  morning and again the staff greeted us upon arrival and explained everything to us. The food was delicious. I had hot smoked salmon on sourdough with cucumber and boiled egg, and hubby had eggs Benedict. Many other items were available at the buffet so you definitely would not go hungry. Check out was seamless and we were sad to leave. The personal touch wax obvious throughout our stay. Thank you so much .",5,2024,02,26
141,An amazing hotel at the heart of Leicester Square,"Wow what an amazing hotel, we had stunning views and staff were all excellent. 

We loved everything about the hotel, our breakfast was stunning. You have to experience the heated toilet seats 😂

We will definitely be back because the combination of location, price and quality.",5,2024,02,25
141,"Great Hotel, we enjoyed it a lot","The Hotel is in a great location, Staff members very professional, polite and helpful.
We had a room with street view, very clean, modern and quiet, 
We used the concierge a lot, great team, they know the city very well and can recommend good places to visit and eat. 
What is also great is the SPA and GYM, after a long day outside you can relax and enjoy the sauna and swimming pool.
The Location is TOP, 10-20min walk distance most of the known monuments that london has to offer.

I was mostly there for business but still managed to combine pleasure with it.

Will definitely cone back in my next visit to London!!!

141,Lovely Quiet oasis in the Midst of Leicester Square,"Having stayed in London before we decided to try a new area. The Londoner was highly recommended by friends  and we booked it through American Express Platinum. I was hesitant, as Leicester Sq is like Times Square and I was concerned the noise would be an issue.  Once you walk through the doors of The Londoner, it is only peace and quiet and elegance with a touch of whimsy.  The front desk was exceptionally gracious and we were upgraded upon arrival.
The rooms are clean and well appointed, with enough space for my daughter and I to share the room. We were greeted by a very nice bottle of champagne as well.
Breakfast is fantastic- lovely assortment and eggs etc available to order.
We were so close to SOHO, Chinatown and the tube station so it was very convenient  If we wanted a cab or Uber we just walked a couple blocks to avoid the car having to snake through the crazy traffic in the area.
While you are there stop at the 8 rooftop bar -just beautiful and the drinks were amazing!!!
Everyone in the hotel is lovely and is the epitome of customer service.  
The gym is very well equipped but one small issue-there aren't any wipes to clean off machines after use.
The Retreat is a lovely spot to have tea and just relax  outside ones room
The Spa and treatments are also excellent
We would definitely stay again!",5,2024,02,20
141,Overnight stay at the Londoner,"My stay here was absolutely exceptional! The room was amazing for a standard room it was also quite spacious. The staff were very helpful with decorating the room prior to arrival for my partners birthday. They also left some treats in the room complimentary which was lovely. Bed was very comfortable, rooftop was stunning, live music was amazing and afternoon tea was sensational. Thank out to all stay members for making our stay easy and relaxing :)",5,2024,02,20

Technology in the room was great and food  and drinks were lovely. 
Recommend booking a lounge bed for the spa in advance too .",5,2024,02,18
141,Disgruntled customers!,"A very disappointing stay for what was to be a lovely few days in London! 

The professionalism of staff was uneven - some seem competent, others were rude and at times ignore you.

There is a lack of communication between the reception, bars and restaurants in the hotel in terms of guests’ requirements.

It was very difficult to get a taxi outside as you need to walk to a side street, and neither did the doorman acknowledge us or offer to help on any occasion.
 
The bedroom seemed small, dimly lit and there was no door into the bathroom which was rather off-putting, there is also little drawer and cupboard space for clothes.
 
Avoid the first floor bedrooms, and possibly the second floor as well, as the music from downstairs traverses up through the floors and you will not get any sleep! Certainly not what you expect from a five star hotel.

Have stayed in the past but very disgruntled customers and unlikely to return.",1,2024,02,15
141,"Amazing location, trendy social spaces, and some friendly staff","I really liked the social spaces of The Londoner, the views, the location (excellent), and the bars/restaurants. The breakfast was DELICIOUS. One comment though was the service was on and off. Some staff give incredible service, and some (it felt like) they didn't particularly care. Otherwise, I'd be back. Very cool hotel.",4,2024,02,15

141,2 night stay,"We stayed here for 2 nights recently, we thoroughly enjoyed our stay. The staff were very attentive and we even received a box of chocolates in our room as it was our anniversary.

141,Amazing from start to finish!,"One of the nicest hotels in London ive ever stayed in. 

Amazing staff
Gorgeous decor
Plenty of bars 
Live entertainment 
Champagne bar - 10/10
Rooftop bar - amazing atmosphere (although note its actually a closed roof so have to come downstairs if a vaper/smoker)

When we checked in (250) we knew we were early and the room wasn't ready so we were whisked away to 'Joshua's tavern' the pub attached to the hotel and were given a complimentary drink (could have wine beer gin and tonic or soft drink). At 330 we had booked a cabana by the spa and our room still wasn't ready (systems were down) so as a sorry we were upgraded to a deluxe king and offered free complimentary breakfast (normally £39pp) 

The rooms were spacious, comfy bed and great shower. And even heated toilet seats! 

The breakfast was also amazing- lots of Cold choice (unlimited) plus a few hot choices to order 

I will 100% be returning. Thank you for a lovely stay",5,2024,02,05

She quickly turned a potentially disastrous situation into a very memorable stay. I will be back.",5,2024,02,04
141,Contemporary Luxury,"My best friend treated me to a weekend in London. 

Checking in at The Londoner it was evident immediately that this was a luxurious chic hotel. Professional service from the doorman to the staff in the incredible Spa. Sophisticated seating areas (a great private lounge for residents to enjoy complimentary hot and soft drinks).

We enjoyed cocktails on the rooftop at no 8 The Londoner but didn’t eat in the hotel. I don’t doubt that the food isn’t wonderful 

Booking a Cabana in the spa ensured our experience felt completely luxurious. 

The hotel is in a fabulous location yet we enjoyed a peaceful and confortable nights sleep.

We explored (on foot) Soho, Convent Garden, New Bond Street, Piccadilly - even walked to Victoria for the theatre. 

5 stars all the way. Will definitely return",5,2024,01,29

141,Location perfect. Hotel what a disappointment!,"We arrived on the 29th December - so under no illusion it wouldn't be busy! But I can't except is poor customer service for the price per night we paid. 

Pros
- Room is lovely and detail is stunning
- View of the London Eye 
- Breakfast is 10/10
- Lobby bar in the evening was fabulous with a live singer 
- Location is perfect 

Cons
- Spa was a disappointment - Towels were left everywhere and in piles on the floor. 
- No staff present 
- No powerful  jacuzzi 
- Roof top bar for NYE was awful. 20minute wait for 1 drink. 60minute wait for bar bites. 
Garden furniture stuffed together to sit on. 
- Then the cheek to add a 13.5% service charge to the bill. This is added automatically on all bills once we checked.",3,2024,01,14
141,Disappointing Experience at The Londoner Hotel,"My spouse and I recently had the opportunity to stay at The Londoner for 6 nights. Although a beautiful hotel, our experience left much to be desired. From the beginning, there were issues that marred what was supposed to be a special anniversary holiday getaway.

After an extremely long day of travel, upon check-in, we were given the wrong room type. When I brought this to the attention of the front desk staff, instead of acknowledging their mistake, they assumed it was my error. Despite my reservation clearly indicating the correct room type, the staff insisted that there must have been a misunderstanding on my part. In addition, the room type that I booked was not available.  This initial encounter set a disappointing tone for the rest of our stay.

I discovered an additional charge on my final bill that was not discussed with me during the check-in process. When I inquired about this unexpected fee, the staff indicated that it should have been explained to me.  We were told we could have asked to take it off, but by then, the bill was paid in full.  It was disheartening to realize that the hotel had not been transparent about this extra charge at check-in.

Furthermore, I was assured that a final copy of the bill would be emailed to me, but I never received it. This lack of follow-through on their part added to the overall sense of unprofessionalism and a lack of attention to detail.

While the hotel did offer some compensation, the gesture felt more like damage control than a genuine effort to rectify the situation. It was clear that they were not overly concerned about the inconvenience of having to change rooms. 

To add a final touch of disappointment, our anniversary went completely unnoticed by the hotel staff. Many hotels make an effort to acknowledge special occasions, but unfortunately, this was not the case at the Londoner. It was a missed opportunity for them to enhance our experience and create a lasting positive memory.

The hotel is located in a very centralized location and easy to access any neighborhoods in London by foot or public transportation.  During our stay, the staff we encountered in the lobby, residence, and elevators were all very kind and pleasant.  The room was clean and beautifully decorated.  

I hope that future guests have a more positive experience, as the shortcomings I encountered should be addressed for the betterment of the hotel's reputation.  The overall theme is that the hotel needs to put more effort into customer service and satisfaction.  There are a lot of beautiful hotels in London and I put a high value on how a hotel treats its customers who are spending a lot of money to stay there.",3,2024,01,12
141,Best hotel in London,I’ve stayed in most hotels within London and this is by far the BEST hotel I’ve stayed in so far. From the staff to the location everything is perfect! The only downside I can find is that my room was narrow but it really wasn’t an issue. However the bed and bathroom were fantastic. Looking forward to revisiting!,5,2024,01,11
141,Modern Hotel in Leicester Square,"I booked this hotel after my daughter recommended it. We were checked in by Calantha who was very friendly and arranged an upgrade for our room and our friends room as I am a Gold Member with Hotels.com. She then very kindly offered us a drink at the bar and talked us through the facilities at the hotel. Can’t thank her enough she a credit to the hotel.

The rooms are all modern and come with an extensive minibar, a steamer for your clothes, tea and coffee machine and all the usual things you would expect to find.

The bathroom had a Japanese toilet, a bath/shower room which was separate from the toilet and sink.

If you are staying at the hotel there is a club lounge for guests which offers delicious nibbles to have with your drinks. I think non alcoholic drinks are free but you have to pay for alcohol.

I would definitely book this hotel again.",5,2024,01,09
141,First time visiting and definitely returning!,Great stay for my wife’s birthday. All the staff were welcoming (especially Philip on reception). We received a room upgrade as a result of the birthday celebrations which is something we rarely see when celebrating at hotels. We will definitely be returning. ,5,2024,01,07
141,The Londoner Hotel perfectly located for us!,"Excellent location, staff so lovely, it’s our 4th time here, we were upgraded , had views over the square and Christmas market. 
Fabulous Christmas decorations throughout the hotel. 
The residents only lounge is a bonus, at peak times, so relaxing with its own free snacks. 
Hotel facilities are an added bonus! 
Hairdressers/beauty salon/Spa/pool/gym/health bar/3 restaurants.",5,2024,01,06
141,Awesome hotel in great location,"Just spent a few days here and had a great time. The hotel is walking distance to lots of things in London.  Leicester Square, Bond Street shopping, selfridges, Buckingham palace, Covent Garden, all walking distance.

The hotel is one of the newest in London and only a few years old. Everything is immaculate and the staff all very helpful. 

The spa is amazing and one of the best inner city. The steam and sauna are 65 degrees which wasn’t warm enough for us but will be for most guests so I suppose they have a lot of people to please which is fine.

There is a cool rooftop restaurant but you need to access via the public lift and not the guest lift. 

It’s the second time I’ve stayed here and I will be back.",5,2024,01,05
141,London Gem,"The Londoner is centrally located. The staff is amazing, and the design of the hotel and rooms is lovely.  Boris at the front desk and Rado at the Door were particularly helpful during my stay.  I will definitely return.",5,2024,01,02
141,"The best hotel experience I have ever had in london- friendly and attentive staff, beautiful spa, gym, hotel room!","Caring and friendly staff, location is excellent to discover thte city. The whole hotel looks phenomenal, we especially like the lounge, that all hotel residents can use free of vharge to enjoy a tea and relax, it was our favority spot during our 4 day stay here",5,2024,01,02
141,Modern yet comfortable luxury in London,"From the first welcoming check-in to the final checkout, every member of the staff was highly professional and welcoming. The hotel itself was modern and beautiful, in its decor, yet not cold, but rather warm. The rooms were beautifully appointed, and so were the bathrooms. The housekeeping staff was very attentive, maintaining a low profile, but immediately cleaning the rooms twice per day, and recognizing when items were utilized and necessitated replacement without being told.Almost everything was just within a 10 minute walk and so the location was very central and perfect. That said, the location was in a very congested part of town very similar to Times Square in New York, though the hotel always was secure and safe. Because the hotel does not have a driveway that leads right up to the front, due to its location in LeicesterSquare, pick up and drop off with luggage can be a little bit tricky, but easily overcome by the doormen who are always ready to help. The hotel has a hip vibe, which was also very refreshing for our 23-year-old son, but still luxurious enough for our more mature tastes. Overall, we had a fantastic day, and would definitely recommend it and come back again, ourselves",5,2023,12,31
141,I won’t be coming back =(,"The Londoner used to be my favorite hotel. Sadly, I had an unhappy stay this time. I enjoyed the breakfast hot buffet they used to have, however, they removed the hot buffet and changed to a La cart. Several issues I encountered with Londoner: 1.  The phone system is not working, no direct dial to the front desk or housekeeping. (24-hour host service for every need?? ) 2. Ordering additional amenity items on TV is not working, had to call housekeeping but phone didn’t work. 3. The shampoo bottles were crystalized and need replacing.  4. The management insisted on removing the beverage trolley from the room because I was being upgraded and they said the trolley shouldn’t be in there at the first place. The hustle of removing the trolley wasted me 2 hours of waiting and going down to front desk personally( phone didn’t work). 5. I haven’t seen any 5-star hotel that doesn’t have bottle water in the gym. Despite the unpleasant experiences listed above, the Residence serves free tea and soda was nice. Breakfast is still nice but they were too busy and service got slow. Upgraded room was beautiful. But for the rate paid and service received… I’m not coming back.",3,2023,12,29
141,Amazing experience but Christmas Day experienced a grunge  grumpy hotel manager ,"This hotel is amazing, the staff are amazing but unfortunately we experienced a very rude bar manager on Christmas Day. This was our family Christmas Day and after a beautiful day the the Corinna hotel we wanted to relax, play cards and be together. My daughter had a box of chocolates to share but the hotel manager very rudely told my daughter she couldn’t bring anything from outside unless purchased in hotel. I understand hotel policies but this was Christmas Day. A waiter called Orkun was so sweet - took us to the residents area which we hadn’t know about to enjoy the evening.  It such a shame the manager was so rude on such a family important day as apart from that the hotel was amazing. ",4,2023,12,27
141,They kicked me out because I was sick,"""My recent stay at the Londoner wasn't quite what I expected. While the initial impression was positive, my experience took a turn for the worse when I unfortunately fell ill during my trip. I informed the hotel staff about my illness which was not contagious and I have the test results with me, hoping to find a solution that would allow me to rest and recover comfortably. Unfortunately, their response wasn't what I anticipated.

Instead of offering alternative arrangements or understanding my situation, the hotel decided to terminate my stay. This left me feeling unwell, disoriented, and without a place to recover. While I understand hotels have policies in place, I was disappointed by the lack of flexibility and empathy shown during my time of need.

To add to the frustration, the hotel refused to refund the remaining days of my booking despite the unforeseen circumstances. This left me feeling financially burdened on top of dealing with my illness.

Overall, my experience at [The Londoner] fell short of expectations. While the facilities themselves may be adequate, the lack of understanding and flexibility during a difficult time left a negative impression. I would recommend potential guests to carefully consider their options and potential risks before booking, especially if they are concerned about unforeseen circumstances.""",1,2023,12,22
141,Great Reception Staff,"From check in to check out, the stay was perfect. I was shown around by Camila and Alicia who explained all the facilities in the hotel. The Spa is so serene and relaxing. Breakfast in Whitcomb’s was great value for money. The view from the room of Leicester Square during Christmas made the stay more festive. Staff are at the standard you expect from a 5 star hotel. Philip on checkout was very polite and recognised we went to the theatre which was a nice conversation on departure. Highly recommend this hotel.",5,2023,12,22
141,Birthday surprise ,"Went here to celebrate my husband’s 28th Birthday. I couldn’t have picked a better location. The hotel was phenomenal! The hospitality from the staff was out of this world, they were really accommodating. The set up was stunning too. My husband and I really enjoyed our stay here. Thank you!! ",5,2023,12,17
141,Very bad customer service not 5*,"I was supposed to be staying in the Radisson next door and was advised at check in they had overbooked and I was being taken to your establishment to which I agreed only to be shown to a room which was so small and had a window overlooking an interior function room. I asked to be upgraded and the receptionist advised she could upgrade me to a suite and said suite would be £500 per night to which I agreed.

Upon checking out I was presented a bill for £500 + £369 per night - absolutely not acceptable and not what was agreed. After much deliberation from the receptionist I was left standing with my 4 year old daughter in reception for 20mins waiting to see a manager who then after more discussion finally agreed that his staff perhaps needed more training on the communication front - absolutely! And whilst they are receiving this training I think perhaps you could show them how to also forward a  VAT receipt because it seems they aren’t able to do so !

Since checking out now over a week ago I have sent 5 emails and called 4 times requesting a  VAT receipt  which I still have not received .  If you cannot find the time to send me a VAT receipt for my booking then I’m afraid I will have to take my complaint further with your head office and also will be publishing my dissatisfaction on all hotel review sites.",1,2023,12,17
141,A classy hotel in the centre of London,"Classy hotel with quality service, rooms and food.  We had an issue on checking in that was well managed by Stelian the FOH Manager and the remainder of our stay was comfortable and enjoyable.  We attended an event which was well run and the food and drink was excellent",5,2023,12,11
141,Great experience! ,"We had the most amazing stay at the Londoner. The service was top notch starting with the breakfast service. Right when we would set an empty plate or glass down, someone was there to take it away. Olivier, the manager, was on top of everything and so great to talk with. The food was also excellent. 
Tbs gym and spa are also fantastic. The rooms were so clean and nice. The layout of the hotel utilizes every inch of the space and there’s quite a few places to grab a drink. There’s a tavern down below, speakeasy like, and a rooftop terrace. All around a wonderful experience from start to finish! ",5,2023,12,08
141,Noise level warning - party hotel ,"Unacceptable noise levels in the room from hotel party areas.  Avoid staying if you expect a quiet room before midnight - not suitable for business trips. Small, stylish rooms that would be fun if you are out and about until late in the evening. ",1,2023,12,07
141,Excellent Stay,"My husband surprised me for a night at the Londoner for my 40th birthday as we were dining at the Ritz.
The hotel staff are amazing and made our stay extra special. They organised early check in for us, we had a gorgeous room, extremely silent, I loved everything about the room. The heated toilet seat was lovely. During our stay they rang to see if we were enjoying our stay and surprised me with a lovely plate of lush chocolates and they had scattered a number of Polaroid photos around the room of us which was just absolutely lovely. We managed to use the pool and spa during the afternoon, they gave us a lovely big double day bed and we even managed an afternoon nap, I felt so relaxed, really set me up for a fancy night at the Ritz.
The following day we enjoyed the complimentary bar for tea and coffee and snacks before we checked out. All in all a fabulous hotel in an amazing location. I’d absolutely love to stay here again. Thank you to everyone at the hotel.",5,2023,12,03
141,A Star is Born,"I have been to London 100+ times over the years on business and leisure and i have had the pleasure of sleeping all around the town (that doesn't sound right- chuckle) and i have stayed at just about every 4 & 5 star hotel there is. I can now say i have found a hotel to return to again and again. The Londoner is in a great location. The hotel is new and contemporary and warm with a great sense of hospitality. The staff and management of the hotel all send off a sense of pride and efficiency in working at the hotel. The rooms are warm, safe and modern (could use a few robe hooks in bathroom), beds are extremely comfortable. The bar/restaurant ""8"" on the rooftop is a great sanctuary in the city- fun vibe, good food. ",5,2023,11,27
141,Great hotel in a great location.,"Excellent hotel in a great location. Only stayed one night so didn’t get to experience all of the amenities, but the room was very comfortable and quiet. However, the art on the toilet wall is an obvious overtly political statement and anti tory party. Apparently others have complained about this previously and seeing as it hasn’t been removed, it seems as though the management are comfortable with making conservative members/supporters/voters uncomfortable in their hotel. Perhaps this aligns with the politics of the owners, which is fine, but then perhaps they should just put a “Tory’s not welcome” note on their website so that we can chose to spend our money elsewhere. One star deducted.",4,2023,11,26
141,It's Supercalifragilisticexpialidocious,"I stayed at The Londoner Hotel for two wonderful nights with my sister .. a staycation for me as I live in London and a lovely trip up from Dorset for my sister.. a weekend away from it all…no husbands.. no children.. no dogs.. and no dishwasher.   From arrival to departure we were treated like VIPs..  We were given a tour of all the hotel has to offer by one of the lovely reception staff who had checked us in and, whilst our luggage was whisked away by other staff ,we were shown to our room.

 I say room but we had been fortunate enough to have been upgraded to a suite.  I think my mouth actually fell open upon being taken in to the room.  The enormous living space, beautifully decorated, had floor to ceiling windows (which we later discovered were actually doors, one of which opened up on to a sort of standing area). The view looked out towards Westminster, with the statue of Horatio Nelson standing proud above the roof tops of London.. what a sight. There included a complimentary drinks trolley so we raised a glass or three to Horatio a bit later on! Not only did we have a place to lounge with a beautiful view there was also a dining area, very useful for those room service moments! 

Is it the done thing to mention toilets?  I’m not sure, but the toilets are of the Japanese variety that greet you with a warm seat, and …, well I’m sure you’ve heard the rumours, I need go no further.  And the bathroom… what a fabulous shower and super soft not run-of-the-mill slippers!  
The Bed was so comfortable; I have actually got an order in for some of the pillows, which they do sell! 

Our room booking included a complimentary breakfast, everything was delicious and the attention to detail from the staff was fab, not too attentive and not too inattentive.. Just right. 

The concierge staff were incredibly helpful but sadly last minute tickets to see Cabaret would have meant donating a kidney so we settled for staying in and having a wonderful relax with room service, a bottle of bubbly and the TV remote to ourselves.  Incredibly there was a huge demonstration going on in the area which we only knew about when we opened the glass door to our suite , prior to that we had heard nothing!!  

The hotel is very modern, full of life and many nods to Theatreland, but, despite it’s size, it feels extremely intimate due in no small part to the lighting and artwork (lookout for the peep holes in the lifts).  Located bang in the  centre of London’s West End, The Londoner is within easy walking distance to China Town, the theatres, museums and loads more.  We had a so so meal in China Town and retrospectively we wished we had asked the Concierge for his help in making a booking somewhere. 

Finally can I just mention the cocktails in the 8 Bar on the eighth floor.  One just isn’t enough.  I fear I can’t remember the names of the cocktails we loved… you may just have to try them all.  

So we left The Londoner having walked quite a bit (can I recommend a bus to Brick Lane on a Sunday for the markets), and we were so sad to go.  But it was cheering to find on our return to our respective homes that the dishwasher’s required loading and everyone was still alive so perhaps we will do it again one day!!

Thank you The Londoner and all it's wonderful staff for giving us a really wonderful stay and some special memories.",5,2023,11,22
141,Bad experience,"DO NOT book this hotel. They can not be trusted with your valuables and the staff are THEIFS with Managers who support them. I stayed here and put our valuables in the safe, we was told no one will have access to that safe other then me. I went out for dinner and when I returned my safe had been reset and emptied. After frantically shouting for hotel security and police through this traumatic ordeal, security staff came back to me with ‘some of my valuables’ they explained they thought I had checked out so they emptied the safe!!! When I checked my belongings £2,000 had gone missing!! The hotel have not supported me in any way since this traumatic experience, they have treated me disgustingly. They haven’t offered any good will gesture for the trauma they inflicted on me in the first place, or give me no reassurance that the staff who have stolen will be held accountable and that my losses will be returned. Instead they just kept telling me there is NOTHING they can do until they have investigated this. This was now 4 days ago and I still have received nothing from the hotel but LIES, BREACHES, ROBBERY and NEGLIGENCE do not trust this hotel!!! This hotel ruined the whole trip for my family. Time we will never get back!!",1,2023,11,21
141,Great Service from Rohan👍👍👍 Best Location for enjoying Leicester Sq.,We had great service from Mr.Rohan (Front Desk) the check in process is very smooth and convenient as he recognized our iPrefer member and allow us for early check in as we arrived early in the morning. .. so we can wash up ourself and ready to explore around the hotel.,5,2023,11,21
141,Best hotel I’ve stayed at in london ,"The best hotel we’ve stayed at in london and we’ve stayed at a lot.
Everything about the hotel was 5* from the rooms, the facilities the food and the service. The location is also perfect, we don’t want to stay anywhere else in london after this trip.",5,2023,11,19
141,An absolute must and the best stay in London,It’s easy to say that the Londoner holds the highest standards when it comes to prestigious hotel stays but what really defined our stay was the exceptional and astonishing service from the staff . It’s safe to say that the Londoner has been one of the cosiest and most welcoming hotel I’ve ever stayed in. Lastly I wanted to point the breakfast the whitcomb’s where we greeted and served everyday by Olivier who made our experience so enjoyable with his genuine  hospitality and charismatic service. Thanks again to Olivier and the staff for this unforgettable experience. ,5,2023,11,18
141,Mini break in London....Amazeballs Hotel!,"I had the most amazing stay with my sister at this fabulous place. 
The hotel is very accommodating it has everything you need under one roof.
 Our room was simply divine, it was so great we didn't want to leave it on our first night so we took advantage of the room service to order dinner which arrived quickly and piping hot. The food from the room service menu was varied and delicious. 
We had breakfast at the hotel which we could not fault, lots of choice and super tasty to set you up for the day.
The staff were all so helpful and quick to respond to any requests .
I hope to return again soon! ",5,2023,11,16
141,Potentially superb,"There is a lot to commend this hotel: the very warm welcome on arrival, the elegant lobby, an atmosphere that suggests this is your home from home. It has the best aspects of a big hotel but the intimacy of a boutique hotel. A good mix.
The room we had was a Deluxe king Room. I was expecting a bigger room to be honest, it was a bit cramped - long and narrow. However, it was stylishly furnished and there was incredible attention to detail as well as expert use of the available space. The shower/wet room was excellent but the bath is less than full size which meant it was difficult to have a properly relaxing bath experience!
We visited the 9th floor roof bar. It was surprising to be seated on the side without a view when the area with stunning views across London was virtually empty. When having drinks in the lobby bar the service was a bit hit and miss - the staff member who took our order either didn't place it at the bar or it was lost somewhere because a second staff member then came to ask us to repeat it all. However, our host - Joy - lived up to her name and epitomised the style and panache of the place. She is a credit to the team.
The pool is an oasis, it is worth thinking ahead and booking a cabana so you can have a properly relaxing experience. 
Breakfast was excellent on each morning. A good range of very tasty options and the cooked breakfast was especially good and made to order.
Overall this is an excellent option for a city center stay. It is a very stylish hotel in a great location. There are a few tweaks to be made to staffing in the bars and for the price I think the rooms seem on the small side, and as a result stop me giving the hotel an excellent rating.
",4,2023,11,16
141,Excellent Service! ******,"Excellent Service! Everybody of them was great in communication and extremely helpful! When you arrive at a hotel, the first impression gives you a feeling. When you leave a hotel, most of the time you know if you would come back. In this case I did very well appreciate all the help and support. Congratulations to the team and the coach who should earn credits for that.",5,2023,11,13
141,Fantastic hotel with welcoming staff,"Excellent amenities, staff and location. When we checked in there were a number of Halloween treats waiting for us which were delicious. The staff were attentive, always on hand to ensure our stay was as pleasant as possible - nothing was too much to ask. The facilities are also incredible - a relaxing pool area and a gym with better equipment than you'd find in most gyms nearby. ",5,2023,11,12
141,A haven amongst the chaos!,A haven amongst the chaos! As soon as you step in to the hotel the beautiful scent and relaxing decor remove all the stress from tackling the masses outside. Wonderful service coupled with the high end rooms and products inside makes this a must if you want to be amongst it all but still have some peace when needed.,5,2023,11,12
141,Not bad,"Lovely place to stay. The staff at the front desk and concierge were very friendly and accommodating, which always makes such a difference. The rooms themselves are pretty good, neat and clean, pretty standard but are a bit squashed with not much space to fit a suitcase. The restaurants/hospitality is what let this place down though. The breakfast was very disappointing, the worst hotel breakfast we have ever had unfortunately with the cereal being stale, undercooked poached eggs, minimal variety, dried up and brown fruits etc and we did try multiple days there, luckily though there is a McDonalds just downstairs. 
And the restaurant downstairs had awful service, the staff must be paid very well. The location is good, very easy to walk to places or get a taxi and a few convenience stores nearby.",4,2023,11,11
141,Best weekend away at the Londoner!,"One of the best weekends away we have had in a long time. The Londoner is definitely one of the best hotels in London. We have been many times now and every time it amazes us. Great location, friendly staff ( especially Rohan and Jennifer ) and just an absolutely great experience I recommend it to everyone definitely book if your looking for a hotel in London could not recommend more.

141,Birthday weekend at The Londoner,"I booked 2 nights for my birthday weekend and I enjoyed every second of it. I appreciated the quirks and little touches that make this a boutique hotel. A lot of thought has been put into this hotel from top to bottom and I can only express how tranquil and relaxed I felt.

As soon as I walked into the hotel the staff were very friendly and welcoming and I felt at home. The receptionist Rohan and waiter Rippon were both very accommodating and hospitable. I would like to express a huge gratitude to Arnaud for going above and beyond and making my birthday one for the memory books. 

I enjoyed my time here so much so I booked an extra night. Thank you for the wonderful stay, The Londoner team.",5,2023,11,05
141,Great Stay in Londontown!,The stay was amazing! The staff were very helpful and welcoming. Kieren was always a pleasant welcome at the door. Gave me some great advice on Arsenal throwback kits to purchase for my visit to the Emirates stadium. The room was great. The amenities and breakfast were also great. Overall great stay!,5,2023,11,03
141,Our year at the Londoner ,"October - Back again for our fourth stay this year. If you haven’t picked up by now, we LOVE this hotel!! The same faces greater us by name and we had a wonderful time catching up with the staff who have become dear friends. Thomas made sure we had our favorite room and it was great catching up with Nicholi at the Stage Bar. We will be sad to see him leave. Catalina’s amazing smilie is always welcoming and she recommended some great music venues and restaurants. A new friend is Olivier, the manager at breakfast. He has rearranged the eating space and the buffet and seating is greatly improved.

August 2023 - We are back again for our third stay at The Londoner. After a week traveling in Spain and France, it was so nice to be “home” with the staff here. Again, as soon as we arrived we were greeted by people we have come to think of as close friends. I cannot overstate how professional, hospitable and accommodating the staff here is.

Of course the bars and restaurants in the hotel never disappoint and the variety of drinks the mixology team creates are outstanding.

More to follow…..

May 2023 - From our second 10 day stay at the Londoner. This time we brought our son and his girlfriend along as a celebration of their graduation from college. We were so excited to see our friends that we had made during our last stay at the Londoner and introduce them to our son.

From Dave in concierge sorting our car from the airport (Many changes no thanks to Delta Airlines), to the incredible welcome from Tom and staff including Rohan who made it his personal mission to ensure that our room was the one we wanted, our check in was amazing.

We were excited to see Dario still behind the bar at The Stage, but while we were disappointed to see Giuseppe no longer serving his amazing drinks at the Y Bar, Mario, Rohan and Si definitely picked up where he left off.

Our son received an amazing haircut and shave at the Retreat, while his girlfriend had her nails done and we all look forward to a number of treatments during our stay.

Catalina helped us at The Stage Bar to make sure that we had great seats for the live singers.

Just like our last visit, the breakfast was on point. The service and food was impeccable. We were waited in by Victoria most of the days we were here and she was engaging, funny and attentive.

We will continue to edit this post as we know that the team that we think of as our London family will control to amaze.

From our first stay in March 2023. My wife and I spent 10 days at the Londoner in March 2023. Our stay was amazing! From the greeting, to the room to the amazing services from Tom the head concierge and Stefani the Wellness Center manager who sorted all of our needs and treatments. We entrusted the bar tenders at the Piano bar and the Y Bar to make us drinks at their discretion and each one was better and more unique than the last! To top off the amazing stay is the fact that the Londoner is part of the Amex fine hotels and resorts program, so we were afforded extra benefits. We will be back and I encourage anyone visiting London to stay here.

Our last night here and Lawrence and Andrew “The Wizard” mixed up their wizardly cocktails. These bartenders will keep us coming back for years!",5,2023,10,29
141,AMAZING 🤩 ,"Just returned from our wonderful stay at The Londoner . It was absolutely faultless .
Staff were so helpful and friendly .
Especially Bernie the concierge who went above beyond ! He even lent my son his raincoat as he had forgotten his 👍
Room was spectacular over looking Leicester Square.
Spa and pool beautiful 😻 
Loved the residence lounge for complimentary drinks lovely touch .
We will definitely be returning with the rest of the family .
Best hotel I’ve stayed in London for sure . 💯",5,2023,10,28

141,Absolutely perfect. Highly recommend,"Stayed here for 2 nights
Wow. This hotel is absolutely amazing

From checking in.. the staff were so welcoming and helpful.. the room was gorgeous. Everything you could need and more. 
The beds were extra comfy with super soft pillows. Bottled Water by the bed turn down service. Hairdryer steam slippers dressing gowns. 
The location right in the heart of Leicester Square. Everything in walking distance to nice and a 2-3 min walk from the tube. 
The food was delicious and the cocktails out of this world. 
The bar staff also super helpful
There is a pool and gym. 
I’ve recently stayed at the savoy but this is far better ..the service and atmosphere is perfect. Definitely be back thanks for making our stay a memorable one",5,2023,10,23
141,The Londoner—A Welcoming and Stylish Oasis in Leicester Square,"We had a very lovely stay here. Aside from the omnipresent rain and construction outside, we really enjoyed our time here. The hotel is stylishly decorated in a contemporary manner, the room was not too large but quite comfortable and the service that we received in the breakfast/tea/coffee lounge (Residence?) was warm and efficient. Mustafa was particularly friendly and interested in getting to know us and making our experience better. The hotel is well situated although in a bustling area and I really appreciated the proximity to the discounted theater tickets booth and the National Gallery/Portrait Gallery. ",5,2023,10,22
141,Wonderful Experience,"We were fortunate to have stayed at The Londoner for 2 nights this week.  It has been a thoroughly wonderful experience. We could not praise it enough. 
From the moment we walked into the hotel, the team of staff took care of our luggage, gave us a complete orientation of the hotel’s facilities and lead us to the wonderful room where the Champagne were chilled, and the delicious canapes await.
The room was spacious with fantastic views over Trafalgar Square, London eye, The Big Ben and beyond. It was a wonder sight to treasure.
The hotel is thoroughly modern with the Retreat offering plenty of leisure and recreational facilities.  We especially recommend the Residence where the atmosphere is friendly, service attentive and Tea & Coffee are complimentary. 
Being in the centre of West End, The Londoner is within walking distance to China Town, the theatres, museums and plenty of sightseeing attractions. 
We have stayed in many hotels around the world.  We would recommend The Londoner as the best hotel when visiting London. 
Thank you, The Londoner, for looking after us.

141,A Beautiful and Contemporary Hotel,"Superb! Loved this hotel and almost everything about it. A large, modern, 350 room elegant and modern hotel. From the moment you stepped inside, past the lovely doorman, it felt like a different world to the noise any busy sites of London. The staff were always friendly, welcoming and eager to help. The rooms were very modern and a great size for London. Even the bathrooms were large. The only unfortunate about the rooms was there wasn't enough hanging space or even drawers for your clothes. Otherwise, they were beautiful. Loved the detail of the crystal looking knob on the room door. The Residences were superb and very well organised and run. A stop for a coffee in the afternoon in the peaceful Residences was very relaxing. A special mention to the mature aged gentleman at Whitcomb's every morning where we had breakfast. He's only been there for a few weeks but what fantastic service. Every restaurant should have one of him. The breakfast buffet was also superb and the service prompt and friendly. The rooftop bar was very beautiful too. Expensive drinks but hey! The atmosphere was great. I would definitely go back and stay at The Londoner again!!",5,2023,10,19
141,Great Escape ,It was a great stay. The first room we got didn't offer the view we anticipated so the team worked to get us a new room that was pretty amazing. The staff was great and I'd absolutely stay again. Room 120 is a great room that overlooks the square. We'd definitely stay here again.,5,2023,10,18
141,Birthday visit,"My wife and I booked this hotel to celebrate my birthday.  We have been to this area of London many before and stayed at a variety of very good hotels in Leicester Square.  On one of our previous visits we went into the Londoner and decided to book my birthday on our next visit to London.  We were not disappointed.  It is lovely.  The price you pay for the room is equal to booking any other 5* rated hotel in the area, but the luxury is better.  The only thing you need to ask yourself is why go anywhere else.  The reception and all members of the hotel staff are there to assist.  No question is a problem.  When we asked for something it was delivered.  There is a residents only lounge which is very nice.  We will be staying again, hopefully in the very near future, my wife's birthday is in only just over two months.  Regards  Mr and Mrs Weers",5,2023,10,18
141,"Amazing architecture, great position, excellent hotel","One of the most beautiful hotels in London. The architecture of the hotel will amaze you in every way. What a beautiful design place! Loved it! Beside the great city position, the service was great and staff were friendly and helpful. The only minus was the downsized breakfast place. It thence to be a bit overcrowded. But the breakfast was excellent in variety and quality of the products.",5,2023,10,16
141,Sad to leave the Londoner.,"Great design, lovely helpful staff,  convenient location and great food & service. Especially Ripon who was calm, efficient and friendly each morning at the very busy breakfast at Whitcombs. Was very quiet. Shower was great.  Even my regular room had a sofa and table. The biscuits were delicious. Spa was lovely also.",5,2023,10,15
141,"The Londoner Revisted:  World’s First Super Boutique Hotel …Conceptionally Brilliant, & Now Ready for Prime Time","We first stayed at The Londoner at Christmas time 2022.  My  first Londoner review concluded that:

The Londoner, the World’s First Super Boutique Hotel is conceptionally brilliant,  but the execution is far from what I would expect given its cost and 5 star rating.  It requires more training of the staff is has and more staff; this would improve the service level dramatically taking the execution to its conceptional brilliance; dressers in the rooms would take it over the top! 
The Londoner’s great Location, cool vibe, and some very unique aspects for a hotel, especially The Residence’s three exclusive spaces within the Hotel: the Y Bar, the Drawing Bar and the Whisky Bar combine to create an exceptional ‘super boutique’ hotel in London .  London isn’t short of remarkable hotels, but the Londoner truly is an experience, setting it apart. Artfully designed at every turn, the property is inspiring to say the least, and is one of the trendiest locations to see and be seen at in the city today. We will return.

We did return, this time on first week of October 2023.  I can honestly say, it is now ready for prime time!   The Londoner General Manager did call me regarding my initial review; horrified to say the least.  He had already spoken with the heads of  Front  Desk, Housekeeping, and HR regarding the items highlighted in the blog.  He wanted to learn more – kudos to him. He appreciated the frank discussion and clearly took it to heart. 
The Reservation Manager responed to our requests immediately and offered us to enjoy the Spa or the Residence uypon our early arrival as the hotel was complely full.  Front Desk staff could not have been more pleasant and professional.  Housekeeping had been contacted to priorize cleaning our room so we could check in as soon as possible after the prior guests had checked out.  Throughout our stay (over a week), Housekeeping did an imeccable job both at cleaning the room each morning and turndown service.  The Londoner had hired more dining staff and clearly trained them as they were attentive, helped each other and prompt.
I get the feeling that the Londoner caters to one night stays – Fashion Events, Business Meetings… hence why there are no dressers and limited storage space for clothes. So if we were going to be staying over a week, we needed to stay in a larger room.  And so we did.  Problem solved, the Suite had a full 6 foot long closet (but only a few hangers).  Housekeeping responding immediately bringing 20 more hangers.  There was a shelf above for T-shirts and the sorts and wire baskets below for underwear, socks… There were plenty of hooks on the wall for coats and jackets.  

There were a couple of signs of wear and tear which is surprising for a hotel so new (opened September 2021). Perhaps it was the choice of fabric on the sofas in the room, but there were a couple of noticable stains (an easy fix to reuphoster with stain resistant fabric).  There was some wood chipped on the closet door, it may have been from the previous guest and they just had not the time to repair.  

There were a few things that I really appreciate about the Londoner rooms:
1)	The Shower:  
The shower is not your standard shower in tub (There was a separate bathtub if you prefer).  The shower is a separate walk in, beautifully tiled and glass doored.  The water pressure is fabulous and there is plenty of hot water even when the hotel is full.  The body wash, shampoo and conditioner were top notch.  I took the longest showers ever.  
To enhance the shower experience, the towels were plush and absorbant and plentiful.
The Dyson hair dryer was brilliant:  hot and powerful.  

2)	The WC (ie Toilet):

Bonus points for it being a separate room (by biggest pet pieve if it is not!) – and large so you did not feel claustrophobic. The seat automatically lifts upon entering the WC – no touch!  The seat is warm – heavenly.  There were all kinds of gadgets that sprayed water every which direction which I opted out of. 

3)	The Bed and Bedding:
The king bed itself was incredibly comfortable. The pillows were perfect and plentiful.  The sheets were divine, very fine and soft cotton.  The duvet was great (albeit a little too warm for me but then again – almost all are!)
The one thing that I appreciate the most about the Londoner Hotel is:

1)	The Residence:

I pointed out in the December blog how special it is but had some executional details t sort out:
A Unique & Brilliant Extension to the Rooms:  The Residence
Probably the clincher for us to book the Londoner is that its Guests have access to three exclusive Residence spaces within the Hotel.  There is the Y Bar, the Drawing Bar and the Whisky Bar.  As The Stage Bar in the Lobby is normally very busy, these private escapes for residents of the hotel are treasured. Complimentary antipasti, soft drinks, tea and coffee are served throughout the day and evening, as well as a complimentary breakfast selection of freshly baked patisseries, yoghurts, fresh fruit and artisan cheese between 9am and 12pm. Full bar service and a dining menu are also available which is great when Whitcombs is packed at Breakfast or you just prefer a little privacy and peace and quiet.  There is also a library of handcrafted Assouline books, classic boardgames and the latest newspapers and fashion magazines to enjoy.
Conceptionally brilliant.  But to execute The Residence well requires more staff.  The complimentary antipasti table offering was thin and was not regularly restocked.  Service was exceptionally slow to the point we just left.  Again, not difficult fixes.
These executional details were also addressed making our use of the Residence a truly treasured one.  It is a perfect spot to relax, have a bite to eat and read the paper, enjoy a drink with a friend or just to enjoy some quiet time.  
The only request would be to offer cheese alternative antipastos.  I loved them but I love cheese.  My husband does not eat cheese so this request is for him and others who would prefer more options.

In Summary
I am grateful we had the opportunity to revisit The Londoner.  It truly is the World’s First Super Boutique Hotel …not only conceptionally brilliant but I can honestly say, it is definelty ready for prime time.  The Londoner’s great Location, cool vibe, and some very unique aspects for a hotel, especially The Residence combine to create an exceptional hotel in London.  We will return.

141,Exceptional Stay!,"Our recent stay at The Londoner surpassed all expectations. From luxurious rooms to impeccable service, every detail was top-notch. The true highlight, however, was breakfast, orchestrated by Olivier an exceptional breakfast manager.

Olivier's warm welcome and passion made mornings extraordinary. The personalised service and attention to detail elevated our stay.

The entire staff demonstrated professionalism and contributing to a seamless experience.  The Londoner team left an indelible mark. Highly recommend for those seeking a luxurious retreat in London. Eagerly anticipating our next exceptional stay!",5,2023,10,12
141,Disappointing end to a lovely stay.,"Had an amazing stay at the Londoner, the spa was one of the best, the king room was lovely too. However, a major disappointment was that they double charged my card during my stay for the night, taking over 1.1k  from my card. I immediately flagged this to the hotel manager and was told I’d be refunded. A few weeks later, I am still chasing for my refund, have emailed and called several times but they refuse to respond, they also blocked my comments on instagram. Such a shame to ruin the experience like this. The lack of professionalism during this time has been such a let down on such a beautiful hotel. I doubt I’d want to stay here again because of this, sadly. ",3,2023,10,12
141,Service standards have gone downhill,"This was my third stay at the Londoner. I found that during this stay the attentive and professional standards have fallen to an unacceptable standard for a 5 star hotel. Our rooms were not serviced or turned down. Until someone appeared at 8am on Sunday to our room and my son and his girlfriend’s room to service. my son was in a corner suite and didn’t receive any of the additional services described on the website. Breakfast at an additional £39 per person was disappointing and not worthy of a five star hotel. I’ve still not received my bill despite chasing several times. 
This hotel is in a prime location in Leicester Square and the hotel is lovely but based on this stay I will be moving to another 5 star for my next stay. Very disappointed the hotel has let its standards fall. 
I would also add the accessible rooms have access showers but bedroom is very tight on space for wheelchairs.",3,2023,10,12
141,Amazing ,"Mustafa from the Residence gave us exceptional service. 
Very friendly and welcoming. Great conversation and we always looked forward to sitting in the lounge 
Hotel was amazing was a great experience. Will definitely go back ",5,2023,10,10
141,Loved it!,"During our three-night stay at The Londoner Hotel in July, my husband and I had a great experience and were impressed. This hotel exceeded our expectations in several aspects. First and foremost, the amenities at The Londoner Hotel were sensational. The gym and pool area were particularly impressive. We took advantage of these facilities and found them to be well-maintained and equipped. The breakfast at the hotel was also a standout aspect of our stay. The quality and variety of options available were excellent. It's worth noting that while the hotel's dining and beverage options were on the pricier side, we expected this given the upscale nature of the hotel. The drinks and food offered were of high quality, and the additional cost was reflective of the luxurious experience provided. We particularly enjoyed visiting the Joshua bar for a drink, where we had great service and there was a great vibe. Definitely recommend!",5,2023,10,10
141,Still waiting for refund two weeks later!,"I booked this hotel for a surprise 30th birthday. The stay was lovely however their systems were down at point of checkout therefore they couldn’t see that I had already paid for the night back in July so therefore I paid again once settling in at the hotel, I then realised I had already paid a reception team promised me I would get a refund. We are now two weeks down the line every time I call I get palmed off or don’t get calls back and I’m still waiting for my refund! What would’ve been a five star is now a two star. I spent a lot of money at the hotel that night In the retreat, at the champagne bar and in the Japanese restaurant, and they can’t seem to give me my refund but quick enough to take your money. ",2,2023,10,05
141,Overated,"Fantastic location and good facilities but the TV didn’t work, the booking system was also down which seemed to be a frequent occurrence. For the price,  the room was small and as mentioned previously many of the facilities were not available. A travelodge would have had these at a fraction of the price.",3,2023,10,04
141,Very good,"This hotel was perfect for our stay in London. The facilities are top-notch, location is amazing, while the concierge and reception staff is some of the best we ever encountered. The Romanian guy working in the reception was particularly friendly and gave us solid recommendations for the trip. All in all, we were very pleased with our choice.",5,2023,10,03
141,Bad value for money and a lack of friendly service,"I had planned to stay at this hotel for a while, but unfortunately, there were several issues that made my experience less than ideal. 

We arrived at noon, knowing that check-in was at 3 pm, but the staff said they would try to find a room for us. They promised to send a text message when the room was ready, but we never received one. After following up a few times, we finally got into our room just after 3 pm. The hotel was confusing to navigate, and the staff seemed more like bouncers than helpers. I wanted to explore the hotel, but instead, I felt awkward and uncomfortable. Even though our room was on the 8th floor, I couldn't find the residence or 8 bar on that floor. 

The gym was empty and in good condition, but the retreat pool was uninviting and crowded with people on cabanas. The towels were a mess, and there were no staff around to help. The spa pool jets only worked for five minutes before turning off, and there were no towels or places to put your belongings since all the cabanas were paid for. The pool was also quite shallow. 

The rooms were very small, even the deluxe city view, and the only interesting thing was the Japanese toilet. The mini-bar was an auto-charge system, leaving us with nowhere to keep our own items cold. 

If we had paid £250, I would have been satisfied, but at £500 a night, there are better hotels with better service. The Londoner seems to be aiming for an upmarket experience, but it falls short compared to hotels like the Savoy or Corinthian.

Its simply an issue of value for money, we would not stay again.",3,2023,09,30
141,Business Travelers Beware.,"Stay at the hotel was quite pleasant; the rooms are small, but clean and updated. 

Following my stay, which was now over two weeks ago, the hotel has been unable to provide me a receipt. When and if reception answers the phone, I'm informed that 'the system is down, there's nothing we can do'. As I was traveling on business, I'm unable to expense my stay until I can produce a receipt. Now I'm left with a $3.5K balance on my credit card until this 'modern' hotel can restore it's email system. ",1,2023,09,27
141,Perfect stay,"Lovely hotel with incredible facilities, ideal location in the Center of london and welcoming staff. Special thanks to Lina who helped us during our stay. Room was also very comfortable. Will definitely come back!",5,2023,09,23
141,Wonderful place to stay,"Other than the room is tiny and pricey, everything is wonderful at this hotel. 

1. Remember to book their afternoon tea! Worth it! 

2. They offer great breakfast. I still miss it when back to the states. 

3. Complementary tea! How wonderful is that. 

Will definitely return to this hotel when visiting London.",4,2023,09,21
141,Incredible hotel in an amazing location,"The Londoner is one of the best hotels I have ever stayed in! From the beautiful lobby and rooms to the incredible service, our experience was amazing. The bed was super comfortable and room service was great. I highly recommend the rooftop bar. They have delicious cocktails. The location of the hotel is really convenient. You are in walking distance to the theater district, restaurants, markets, etc... We loved our time at The Londoner so much that we plan to return next year! The spa is at the top of our list when we return. ",5,2023,09,21
141,Our go to when in London,"We’ve stayed a few times now and the hotel does not disappoint. 
This time we booked 3 rooms for a family birthday, we were welcomed by Boris on reception, he was extremely efficient and noticed we’d stayed a few times and gave us a little treat. The Stage bar is great for people watching, breakfast at Whitcombs is delicious, the rooms are comfy, would like an upgrade next time tho. :-) The Retreat this time round was slightly disappointing, we went for 2 hours and all the beds/chairs had reserved signs on very British as the place was empty and we could  not sit on a bed, think that could be managed very different! However the star employee  of the hotel was Marcin in  The Joshua Bar, exceeded expectations all around! Looked after us for 3 days, thank you.",4,2023,09,17
141,Large group youths destroyed our experience ,Overall it was as expected and good as we are long time returning guests however last night in the spa at 9pm it was overrun with young persons playing really loud music …almost in Ibiza party mood!!  it was tragic to see this behaviour being allowed to carry on as no staff were there or present… this is exactly the opposite reason we would not stay here as it is far from relaxing considering the price paid for our room! Management must stop this or it will ruin your reputation and repeat business.,3,2023,09,17
141,Amazing stay,"We could not speak more highly about our stay at The Londoner. From the moment we arrived we were welcomed by their incredibly friendly staff and taken straight to the check in desk. 
We were staying as a surprise for my husband’s 40th birthday and they kindly upgraded us. Our suite was stunning, with views across to Big Ben and the wheel, and there were beautiful birthday chocolates waiting for us. 
After checking in, we took a look around the hotel and in each area we were greeted by a friendly, knowledgeable member of staff and given a tour. Every area was stylishly designed, the three private residence areas, the stage bar in the hotel lobby and basement spa were all stunning with exceptional service. 
The breakfast at Whitcombs was delicious, especially the crepe soufflé and they catered for all dietary requirements. 
We also had treatments booked at The Retreat. When we got there they couldn’t find our booking but it wasn’t a problem, and we still had our treatments on time. 
Everyone went over and above to make this birthday trip extra special. Thank you The Londoner.",5,2023,09,15
141,Amazing stay at the Londoner,"We had the most amazing time as guests at the Londoner. It’s position in Leicester Square was ideal to experience the buzz of the city. Perfect location for visiting the shops and theatres. 
Check in was busy but also very efficient. We’d arrived at check in early because we had matinee theatre tickets so our room wasn’t ready but our bags were waiting in our room when we got back. 
We were extremely lucky to have received an upgrade to a corner suite which was tastefully decorated, relaxing and with high quality features and amenities. The bed was so comfortable and the views amazing. We also had a complementary bottle of Gusbourne brut which we will be looking to buy again in the future, it was lovely and very much appreciated.
We chose to spend the evening in the hotel and enjoyed cocktails in 8 at the Londoner with it’s iconic views that included The London Eye, Westminster Abbey and Nelson’s Column in Trafalgar Square to name just a few. We then went down to Whitcomb’s for dinner which was delicious and gave good sized portions. 
To finish our evening off, we enjoyed an after dinner drink in Stage which was wonderfully relaxing and the live music was great. 
Breakfast was lovely and offered a good selection from the buffet with additional items that could be ordered from the kitchen. A nice way to end our stay. 
All the staff were extremely friendly and attentive and made us feel very special. We were very impressed all round.",5,2023,09,12
141,The Londoner,"Thank you for a wonderful stay. We had a warm welcome the moment we walk into the hotel. We were greeted by a very nice receptionist named Selby and welcome drink was offered. She introduced all information of the hotel, showing us around all the amenities and art displays along with the restaurants and bars. Then she checked us in in a timely fashion. The hotel atmosphere is great, room is clean and very nice. Breakfast was excellent and the manager Oliver and his team at breakfast along with Ripon and Gabriela gave us the best service.  Everyday we came for the breakfast Ripon remember everything what we are having 4 person.. was great..  Dinner was great as well. Our server Olha was amazing. Overall we had a great experience.",5,2023,09,10
141,One of the best hotel stays EVER! ,"My partner and I arrived at The Londoner Hotel in Leicester Square on Thursday afternoon. It was 30 degree's outside and manic however the hotel entrance was just serene, cool and beautifully welcoming. 
We had arrived a good hour before official check in and our room wasn't ready. Well done to Alecia for checking us in...what an absolutely wonderful and welcoming young lady! 
So firstly we were invited to have a welcome relax and were seated in extremely beautiful main reception / bar area with a lovely cold glass of coca cola each with plenty of ice...then we were so was pleased to be invited to use the amazing spa / pool facilities! 
And BOY oh BOY what facilities they are! After a super tour we relaxed into a stunning swimming pool, sauna and steam room! Incredible! A MUST if you stay at this hotel. Served by a lovely lady with cooling ice water and with just twinkling music in the background. Bliss. 
Then it was check into the room time! Stunning. Pure luxury! I could live there! 
Then we went for the most expensive but most delicious Japanese cocktail in the roof top bar...now when I say expensive, it was, but it was just absolutely beautiful so on this occasion you really do get what you pay for! 
Both slept like absolute dreams in the very very very comfy bed and the pillows are just heavenly. 
Finally, the platinum plated cherry on top of an already very very wonderful cake....Breakfast! Again, blooming expensive but we had this built into our room price BUT...and I do say BUT....WOWWWEEEEEE! What a breakfast! Service was just outstanding....quality, selection, tastes, choice and everything pretty god damm perfect! 
My partner and I have stayed in a many a hotel around the world but we both sat there and said...that has got to be the best breakfast EVER! 
Finally, no it's not cheap BUT...I honestly promise you....you will get every penny and them some back in the experience and sheer wonderful delight of this place! We have both said we will return for Christmas!!! Just got to get saving up! ",5,2023,09,09
141,Amazing place to stay,"My wife and I have stayed at the Londoner hotel last night and we were both amazed with the quality of the all the services we’ve received, 

Thank you to Oliver and his team who have delivered a great service this morning. 

As we’re late for our meeting, and the breakfast was very busy Olivier has managed to find us a table and served our food within a few minutes, his positivity and his smile made all the difference!

We will see you soon",5,2023,09,08
141,A London Surprise,"I had 2 nights at this beautiful hotel. The service was so outstanding, breakfast was delicious. The rooms might feel a little small if you have a lot of luggage however it is very funky and modern.
Well located, near everything you might want to see.
I will definitely return as it is the best service i have experienced in London.",5,2023,09,07
141,A mixed bag,"Nice (and expensive)  hotel but :
- when we checked in, no one explained to us the perks of the hotel (Residence, spa, pool…)
- the rooms are dark, almost oppressive with a relatively low ceiling and dark colours, even if the bed is quite confortable
- no bottle opener in the room although you can’t open the bottles of water provided in the bathroom without
- the bathroom is dark too with the shower in the same room as the bath tub, without a separation and very close to the tub : it is not possible to have a shower while the other person is having a bath.
All in all, we are not sure we will be back.",3,2023,09,02
141,"Perfect, great location, amazing room and service","Wow, didn't even know this hotel was in Leicester Square. There is no normal entrance but once your in all the noise of the square disappears and you feel like you have just entered a bar lounge with the piano playing in the background . 

We were fortunate to be in a suite and all I can say is wow. Everything was top class, the view , the decor and the service. 

Breakfast was first class and again attention to detail. 

Would definately recommend by far best place to stay in London",5,2023,08,31
141,"Great hotel, great staff, great location","Wow- what a lovely hotel with fantastic staff- great location right in the centre of everything- yet so quiet and so comfortable- I couldn’t fault it.
We were greeted and checked in by Boris, who couldn’t have been more helpful-  we were upgraded without asking and the room was spacious and comfortable - everything was spot on for a great nights sleep after being out shopping and eating.
Concierge organised a table at a local restaurant that we wanted to try - which was excellent - review coming - so big thank you to Bernard for that !
We didn’t use any of the facilities as we only stayed a night- but we will definitely be back - nothing was too much trouble for anyone - thoroughly recommended",5,2023,08,31
141,The most memorable hotel experience,"My partner and I stayed at the Londoner Hotel for two nights and I can 100% say that it was the most incredible experience we have ever had. Not only is the hotel itself simply breathtaking but the devotion and dedication the staff pay to their guests is one of a kind. I want to give a special thank you to Shane Logan, my partner requested for there to be a special touch put on our room to make the experience that bit more memorable and Shane went above and beyond for us exceeding all of our expectations. His dedication to detail is unmatched. I could not recommend this hotel enough, its location could not be more central but not only that, the hotel’s facilities itself would make you never want to leave. The staff at The Londoner Hotel work so hard to go above and beyond for their guests to make as memorable as possible. ",5,2023,08,30
141,Everything was perfect,"Perfect luxurious hotel so calming and relaxing with fantastic luxury facilities .

All staff member has excellent customer service skills they were amazing !!

We were so impressed with this place, just waiting to come back.",5,2023,08,30
141,Chic luxury boutique hotel amid the hustle of Leicester sq,"Awesome experience
I stayed here while working nights so was a little concerned about the noise.
The staff were helpful in getting me a quiet room away from escalators, the blackout curtains and thick windows also helped with the noise. 
The gym and public areas as well as the steam sauna and pool were amazing. 
Beautifully designed hotel, comfortable rooms, lovely staff. 
My only gripe was the long time it took to check in.. but that was after being awake for 48 hours, so I just wanted to sleep!
Would defo visit again. Loved the hotel",5,2023,08,27

141,Amazing Stay truly LONDON’s best hotel,"What an amazing hotel. 

It truly is LONDON’s best. The service, facilities and level of care was amazing. 

I would not believe any review accept 5 stars as the staff have not only been brilliantly trained but also love their job which clearly shows. 

Special thanks to Rohan who helped me sort out my faux par with the birthday cake. 

And thanks to Daffney on the front desk who always had a smile. 

The food at 8 was absolutely sublime. 

We had an amazing birthday break and will definitely be back. ",5,2023,08,23

141,"Great hotel, but the swimming pool, unfortunately is barely for children.","It’s a beautiful hotel. It smells great and looks gorgeous. The location is extremely busy, but you know that when you book at Leicester square.
I booked it because I went to London with my 8 year old daughter and I wanted a hotel with a swimmingpool to relax with her.
We had a busy travelday so we went to the pool at 8.30 in the evening. Immediately an employee came to me, quit harsh and said: ‘No children are allowed now!!’ So I told her no one told us. She said: ‘You can swim for half an hour, but no longer!!’ Everyone around us got water and was served, we were treated as if we were doing something really wrong.
We could come back in mornings from 8 till 9.30 and 12 till 1.30. That’s it.
So even though we pay a lot of money to stay there, just like everyone else, we can’t even unwind for an hour at the end of the day, after a busy day.
That’s so unwelcoming.

Inunderstand you don’t want it to be a kindergarten, but come on.

So, I loved the hotel, but this was a real downer.",4,2023,08,22
141,Excellent Stay,We had an excellent stay! All staff were extremely welcoming and helpful! Mihaela Florea went above and beyond to ensure our stay was enjoyable and memorable. Room was lovely and clean with a great view down onto Leicester Square ,5,2023,08,22
141,Brilliant hospitality (The Londoner Hotel ),"The best stay in the best Rohan from reception team was brilliantly welcoming and professional he is fantastic asset to the hotel which went above and beyond to make our stay wonderful and memorable he accommodated my early check in request and gave us the best room with city view which was really amazing, room was lovely, spotless and up to date , best location best service.",5,2023,08,21
141,Rohan was very welcoming and professional,"My younger sister's 18th birthday celebration with us was so much fun.
The receptionist, Rohan, was wonderfully welcoming friendly, helpful, professional and polite.
In addition to granting my request for an early check-in, Rohan provided us the best room with a city view, which was stunning, cosy, with a wide window, and opulently furnished, which was simply great.
To make our stay enjoyable and unforgettable, Rohan went above and beyond. He thoughtfully left a box of truffle chocolates in the room for my sister's birthday as well.
Additionally, I would like to thank the concierges Ola and Callum for helping us with our bags. 
And the young lady Selbi at checkout was so friendly.",5,2023,08,21
141,New hotel in a great location,"Great location, the staff are very helpful. The hotel is in walking distance to Picadilly and Covent Garden. There are a lot of restruants in the area. 
The modern design is nice but not very comfortable, you can't open a window and the room is too dark.",4,2023,08,21
141,A modern comfortable London stay,"Stayed here for a lovely surprise birthday weekend for my partner. Wanted something special and more than our usual ‘economic’ stays and The Londoner was great. Fantastic location I. Leicester Square, we had the Book of Mormon booked along with a film at the Odeon and it was first as it was a 30 second walk to both. 

Check in was a little confusing as I had an email about checking in so I did, then it prompted me to download the app which said I hadn’t checked in for I tried to check in again but it wouldn’t let me so when we got to the hotel we went to reception. That was a bit confusing as there was no clear place to queue so we stood behind some people who were waiting and whilst we waited someone else came in and went straight to the front skipping the queue and the staff member just checked them in even though there were 3 of us in an obvious queue. The staff member told us that the online check in isn’t a check in and the pre authorisation that it too on my card of £2 wasn’t the proper authorisation so she needed to take another but for £150. I didn’t mind any of this but there needs to be consistency and clarity which this wasn’t. 

Anyway, we headed up to our room and WOW! From the lift to the corridor and then into the room, it all felt WOW. The aesthetic of the room was very much our taste, modern but comfortable and thought out. We looked at other 5*s but they all seemed a bit chincy so this is why I picked the Londoner. The radio on as we entered the room, lights set, a box of happy birthday chocolates on the coffee table was a lovely touch. I’ve put some pictures up as they say it all. The Japanese toilet was a great experience and I now want one. The amenities/toiletries were lovely.

The evening turn down was very much appreciated and helped us settle for the evening once we got back from the cinema.

A couple of bits of feedback. In the app or on check in it was never explained about the residence, I only knew about it from prior research and no where explained where it was or how you got to it so I had to go to reception to ask. (Btw it’s beautiful and utilised it for morning pastries and coffee). The cast feature on the TV didn’t work. Only having two English breakfast tea bags, two milks and a couple of sugar wasn’t enough. I did request more via the app but we never got more. There were a lot of scratches, marks and dents in shelves and furniture (for an expensive 5* I thought details like this would be considered). Also I had seen online on the many videos shared by influencers that the hairdryer in the room was a Dyson but in ours we had a none branded one.

All in all, we had a great time and loved the hotel, just a couple of things that for a 5* at £500+ a night I expected fewer ‘issues’

Staff were lovely, friendly and helpful. Will happily come back, just hope the above were exceptions and not the normal experience.",4,2023,08,19
141,Scam hotel,"A member of staff woke us up by banging loudly and incessantly on our door at midnight because he had the wrong room number. Absolutely unacceptable and awful. The maids were rude, the room was full of dust, and the hot water stopped working on our final night. The Londoner is one of the worst hotels we have ever stayed in. We felt uncomfortable and unsafe.",1,2023,08,17
141,Front Desk to the Rescue,I would like to publically acknowledge Stelian and Arnaud at the front desk for their superior service and warm welcoming attitude.  When there was an issue with our American Express booking - they went above and beyond to fix the situation and truly saved the day.  The room is awesome and we are looking forward to a fun week!!,5,2023,08,16
141,A Wicked stay at The Londoner,We arrived at The Londoner after hearing about it on The Chris Moyles Show one morning. We went to watch Wicked and celebrate our Silver wedding anniversary . We have been staying in Leicester Sq when visiting London over the last 5 years  however the hotel next to the Londoner. The last few times it has not been great so we thought we would try The Londoner. I am so glad we did. When we walked in we were met by Thomas and another man (  I forget his name but he worked next door before). They could not have been more helpful. We were shown to our room which was stunning and the finish is so good to the room. The Heated toilet was a surprise!! We had a drink in the champagne bar before trying the street side bar on our way to Wicked which was great. The service from the bar and front of house matched that of the reception and yes it is not the cheapest place to stay but you feel that it is well worth the money. We will return soon. Thanks to every member of staff.,5,2023,08,16
141,Amazing Hotel. True Luxury!,"The room was very spacious, clean, and had the amenities we needed. Pool and SPA was clean and classy. Breakfast was delicious and with many choices. The people in the reception were very helpful, not just on checkin and checkout, but also in giving directions to spots. Particularly, Cassandre was extremely helpful and friendly. The location is great - very near Tube Station and variety of restaurants. I would highly recommend. ",5,2023,08,15
141,Cosmopolitan 5 star all the way!,"My favourite place. Amazingly helpful and polite staff, we were checked in by Adrian, very friendly, bent over backwards for us.
As soon as you are welcomed in by the lovely concierge you feel like you are at home (your 5 star luxury home!!) It's 5 star all the way but not 'stuffy 5 star' it's 'cosmopolitan 5 star'. The lobby is buzzing with all walks of life, holiday makers, business men, ladies at lunch... there is a lovely vibe here.
Rooms are stunning!!! Everything you need is provided from a cool Roberts radio on the bedside table to a dyson hairdryer and the best toilet seat!.......you have to try it ;-)... fluffy robes, complimentary fluffy slippers, you are spoilt!
Our room looked over Leicester Square which is buzzing 24/7, I personally like to have the windows open to absorb the atmosphere but you can close the windows and enjoy a quiet evening in. We had breakfast at the hotel which was delicious, hot, fresh, quality ingredients with a huge variety on offer, the restaurant was immaculate with a laid back feel. After breakfast we grabbed our fluffy robes and went for a dip in the pool which is beautiful, very relaxed, we chilled in one of the cabanas, had a steam, sauna , jacuzzi then swam a few lengths, ice cold water was provided and refilled.
This is my 3rd stay at the Londoner and I would absolutely definitely recommend it to everyone! 
Thank you to all the staff who made our stay perfect again.
See you all soon!

141,Amazing hotel!,"An amazing stay at a n incredible hotel. Everything from the moment we arrived was just perfect. Arnaud and Shane Logan really made the stay extra special, so thank you! 

The location of the hotel is amazing, everything right on your door step, not that you will really want to leave ☺️

Great location just 5 min walk the underground.

Live music in the lobby/bar area and fantastic cocktails at the rooftop. The views of London are worth the elevator ride alone

141,"Fantastic Hotel stay at The Londoner, London","Just back from a few days in The Londoner Hotel. What a lovely experience, the attention to detail and friendly staff made it extra special. Especially Rado, the doorman who remembered us from previous shorter stay, to Rohan who welcomed us and checked us in, Damyan in Whitcombs  and Mariana in housekeeping. The retreat area , including the pool and gym was lovely and relaxing and the staff were friendly and accommodating. 
Looking forward to returning",5,2023,08,12
141,Ok but too expensive for what it is ,Pretty good.  Nice room.  Ridiculously over priced bars and breakfast but otherwise ok.   It’s a great location but there are better hotels for the money. Probably wouldn’t go here again unfortunately.,3,2023,08,10
141,Above and beyond!,"We were very lucky to have been transferred here following an issue with a booking elsewhere. The Londoner is total class, stylish from head to toe. Perfectly located in the heart of Leicester Square, the perfect location to explore should you want to leave the building. The whole hotel is clean, functional and full of little extras that make all the difference. Special thanks to Shane who went above and beyond to salvage my birthday trip and the concierge working this morning who had inspiring ideas for us and armed us with a map. We really couldn't have asked for more.",5,2023,08,10
141,Great experience!,"Absolutely fabulous hotel, great staff great location and beautiful decor. From the entrance to the the roof bar. 
Unfortunately only being in town for one night could not find the time to make use of the spa and pool. 

Will definitely be coming back.",5,2023,08,10
141,Luxury and Elegance in outstanding location... The Londoner,"The Londoner is a great hotel with a fantastic location. Just a couple blocks and you see Covent Gardens, SOHO, Chinatown is right there, all the shows are within walking distance and 12 min walk from London Eye. If you like having tons of movement, restaurants, and people 24/7 this is the place. The area reminds me of Times Square, but when you enter the hotel it transports you to elegance, top of the line service and luxury. They didn't held back on luxury details for their guests. It feels safe, everyone knows you by the second day, the pool and spa is a plus, excellent gym. The staff is so well trained, they go above and beyond for their guests. Overall 5*!",5,2023,08,07
141,An amazing experience in the heart of London,"The best hotel in London! We often stay in London for our anniversary; having stayed at a number of hotels The Londoner was the best we have stayed in. The staff were attentive and provided excellent service. The atmosphere of the hotel from when you first walk in has been designed to make you feel at home but in a luxurious location. Every detail has been considered to ensure your stay is enjoyable. The rooms are well designed with small ‘boutique’ touches.  The lounge, offering complimentary soft drinks and snacks is relaxing, encouraging you to want to stay in the hotel. The best part of the hotel for us was the pool and relaxing space surrounding it; we had a cabana space ( luckily this was available as we did not know this was there and available to reserve) which was relaxing and luxurious. Overall we had an amazing experience and we will definitely be going back to The Londoner.",5,2023,08,06
141,Wow what a beautiful hotel in Leicester Square,Wow what a beautiful hotel. Wonderful welcome from Mr Simon GM and servic and food in the restaurant was amazing thank you Rippon. I wanted to take more pictures of the delicious food but so good I started to eat it before I remembered to take pictures. We only had the set menu great value for money and beautifully served.,5,2023,08,04
141,"Amazing hotel, even better staff ","A jewel of a hotel! Newly renovated and the most comfortable beds I have stayed in and I am a very picky traveler. Probably the best feature - other than location - is the staff. So helpful and kind they go out of their way to assist. Paolo, who works in the lounge and others made us feel right at home. Highly recommend mainly due to the amazing staff - at breakfast, housekeeping, room service and concierge. ",5,2023,08,03
141,A beautiful hotel I won't stay in again,"The Londoner Hotel

London

A beautiful hotel I won't stay in again

I wish I paid attention the bad reviews as they are accurate. Ill make it simple. The hotel is beautiful Clean and modern. The bad is the noise of screaming drunk kids outside is so bad - good luck sleeping. It goes on until 3 am then the sounds of bottles being dumped in dumpsters til 4am. Ruined the entire stay. Worse after being up all night we had an early flight. We go to leave and the bellman - the one with the bowl hat and pushed in pug nose who had given us bad directions every time now wanted to take our luggage as we were running to our limo we had ordered. we said It was ok and he said - do you want to know where your driver is? I said sure he said if you dont let me take your bags I won't tell you. To which I responded Forget you. that was the final straw - Thats what you get there a guy playing games after being up all night. The rooms are beautiful for a cruise ship size room and no where to put your clothing and half a bathroom $700 a night if you can get past that its a good place to stay",3,2023,08,02
141,PERFECT CITY-HIDEWAYA,"We stayed four days in the heart of London in this wonderful hotel. We appreciated the perfect location, the sensational modern decor of the rooms, the outstanding breakfast and the jaw-dropping rooftop terrace with wonderful asian tapas bites. Great helpful staff and really cool atmosphere…",5,2023,08,02
141,It's worth every penny spent.,"I had a wonderful stay here! The location was absolutely perfect, being just one minute away from Piccadilly Circus, making it convenient to explore the city's attractions. The room was very comfortable and provided me with a great night's sleep. The staff was exceptional, always attentive and helpful, making me feel welcomed throughout my stay. A special shout-out to the housekeeper who did an excellent job keeping the room clean and tidy. I must say, it's worth every penny spent. I highly recommend this hotel for anyone visiting London.",5,2023,08,01
141,Excellent,"Everything! despite being 5 star and very posh there is a warm, homely welcome and feeling from the moment u walk in. The excellent service and facilities are matched with stunning decor and exquisite restaurant quality. There is a feeling of equality in the superb way you are treated whether you are in a standard room or suite, the service, efficiency and special touches from the staff make this not just a stay in the hotel amazing but an unforgettable experience that was truly appreciated. Slightly pricy for the average family income but for a special treat if you can 100% recommended for an amazing experience. Equally if 5 star quality is your regular preference this hotel will definitely not dissapoint. A very special Thank you to Rohan on the front desk that made the impossible possible.",5,2023,07,31
141,Very chic and cool,"A very chic and cool spot, service and standards are very high. It’s in a great spot, can be hectic though.  I stayed there a few times and found the staff to be very helpful, the pool and retreat are great spots to escape to. Would recommend this for any one looking for a cool spot in London",5,2023,07,30

141,Very happy,"Very nice hotel - expensive but you get all the bells and whistles.
Only feedback would be the steam room and hot tub were not very hot. But the spa in general was very relaxing.
I would recommend a 1 or 2 night stay.",5,2023,07,30
141,Perfect boutique luxury,"A 5* experience. Great customer facing staff at check in. Superb residents lounge with complimentary soft drinks, tea, coffee, fruit, antipasti snacks and newspapers. Wonderful live music in the evening. Room was boutique luxury with great interface for lights and tech. Only slight issue was being unable to order breakfast via the app so busy on the phone. Would have been good to have had an app overview at check in. Will most definitely return for a quiet, luxury stay in the middle of vibrant London!",5,2023,07,29
141,Time Square vibe…Paris hospitality.,"Took a flyer in this booking on our first trip to London. So many issues with the hotel. 

First note here is that the Leicester Square area is basically a mini Times Square NY. Huge crowds that shift to groups of roving, drunken 20-30 yr old men in the evenings. 

The lobby bar staff were rude and arrogant (felt a little like Paris). The additional spaces like the pub (closed for private events) and the 8 were basically inaccessible during our stay. 

The room itself had a very comfortable bed and modern HVAC. Unfortunately, the designer failed to add space for luggage or drawers for clothing. There was a tiny hanging closet to fit maybe 5-7 hangers. We had to play tetris with luggage and clothing, basically living out of a suitcase for 4 days. No drawer, no closet, no storage.",2,2023,07,27
141,"Nice place, not as good as last time ","Very welcoming and helpful on arrival, a lovely room as usual and so well situated for central London - but at these prices, you’d expect 2 coffee cups in a double room? Disappointed the Residence no longer offers a light complementary breakfast and even more disappointed to find a hidden service charge deducted from my card on the day following check out (now refunded) ",3,2023,07,26
141,Five stars well deserved,"Gorgeous hotel in central London within walking distance to Soho, Westminster and tons of attractions, restaurants and shopping. The staff were wonderful and welcoming, and the interior design is beautiful. We loved the Miller Harris toiletries, fluffy slippers and resident lounge. There were so many great touches that made for a wonderful experience. We moved over after a less than stellar experience at another five
Star hotel nearby and the Londoner far exceeded our expectations. ",5,2023,07,22
141,New favourite London hotel!,"This was amongst the best hotel experiences we have ever had. This wasn’t because the hotel was perfect - there were a few small bits which weren’t quite as good as they could be - but the things that mattered they got absolutely perfect!

Firstly check in is online and incredibly easy. We showed up at 2.30pm which was no problem even though slightly early, they gave us our key and we went up to our room. We had a king room which was really comfortable. The bed was particularly comfortable, and temperature and lighting is very easy to control. The Japanese toilet was fun, although a bit noisy at times! Shower had great power and lovely smelling toiletries from Miller Harris. 

The breakfast was incredibly good and service was, once again, absolutely excellent. Nothing was too much for them, and they got us the newspapers we wanted too. We had full English breakfasts and huge bowls of fruit from the buffet too, and it was all delicious. There is also a residents area with free drinks and snacks all day which we enjoyed relaxing in before heading out for supper.

The spa was also one of the nicest we’ve been to in central London. It was very quiet, had the right lighting levels (for some reason lots of 5 star hotel spas in London are too bright or too dark!), super comfortable big beds which were easy to book, and great facilities. Best of all was their flexibility about us using the spa all day even after check out. Only downside was in the changing rooms they only had one hairdryer - so there was a bit of a queue / wait - although it was a Dyson one. Also no combs or moisturizer which meant you needed to be a bit organised.

The reason this is my new favorite London hotel other than the incredibly central location and comfortable room and spa area though is the staff. There was no officiousness around following arbitrary rules in the hotel - everything was about us as guests having a nice time. Sometimes smart London hotels can be a bit snobby and uptight. Here every single member of staff without exception was just so nice and kind, and really prioritised everything working for us and our needs. 

If you want to stay at a super central hotel which is incredibly comfortable and where you will really be looked after, then this is definitely the one!",5,2023,07,21
141,Seamless Service with a Smile,"From the moment I arrived, the warm and friendly welcome from the doorman, Albert, set the tone for a truly memorable experience, making sure I felt like a valued guest right from the start.

Checking in with Alicia was a breeze. Her efficiency and charm made the process seamless, and she even took the time to share some wonderful local tips and recommendations for my stay.

The spa facilities and dining options are nothing short of amazing.

Thank you all for a fantastic stay",5,2023,07,20
141,Lovely modern hotel with friendly accommodating staff,"Overall a great hotel.
Very friendly and helpful staff, modern, comfortable rooms and everywhere spotlessly clean.
Breakfast was only negative, food was very good but restaurant too small to accommodate the number of guests, queues at peak times.

It’s on Leicester Square, with all the nightlife, and a sort walk to Chinatown, Piccadilly, Soho etc, and 20/30 mins walking distance to Westminster, London Eye, St Paul’s and the Palace. We upgraded to a Deluxe King which has views across the sights. Staff were very helpful and friendly. At £40pp we didn’t have breakfast here but ate in Soho instead, but I’m sure the food would have been good.",5,2023,07,16

141,Second Visit and was Great once again.,Quickly has become my favourite place to stay. The quality of the property and the service are top notch. This was my second visit and it was as hoped for - the same as the first visit.  The residence area is a great area to start the day or go mid-day. The space is gorgeous. Order an espresso martini on the main floor lounge area. You can sip a drink and have lite bites while listening to a singer and piano player. It's all very lovely. ,5,2023,07,04
141,Hotel has gone down hill already,"This hotel has gone down hill since I last visited.
Pros:
- Staff are super friendly and helpful
- Spa is lovely
- The Stage has lovely live entertainment 
- The Residence is a lovely bar where you can enjoy complimentary snacks and beverages
- They did gift us a bottle of english bubbly which was great and some ‘happy birthday’ chocolate’s for my husband
Cons:
- Beds in the spa say ‘reserved’ when they aren’t reserved 
- The city room view is atrocious and I can’t believe they have the cheek to charge extra for that view
- Coffees via room service took over 30 mins
- You hear A LOT of noise from the other rooms, particularly those above e.g stomping & banging
- Curtains don’t shut all the way so the room is light

Honestly for £650 per night it just isn’t worth it. There are better, more affordable alternatives, or just go to one of the top notch hotels for a luxury experience",3,2023,07,02
141,Expected more from this hotel especially as a returning customer who has stayed at this hotel before,"You have overcharged me. Not only did I have to pay twice as I made a mistake which your colleagues took acknowledgment to and could see it was a total mistake you still decided to double charge a returning customer. Not only that you had included breakfast which you later charged me for which is clearly visible on your invoice but could not be dealt with at the time of check out. I have sent a number of people to this hotel which obviously I will no longer do. I am amazed a business of your size would be prepared to ruin its reputation like that. So just in conclusion 
Had two rooms for at total of 11 nights and got charged for 14 nights which equates to over $3000 Aus Dollars, got charged for breakfast which I was told was included and got charged for a mini bar I never used",1,2023,06,27
141,Urban chic vacation in London!,"Urban vacation in London

Super luxurious hotel in the heart of London.
Suitable for a couple's vacation.

All the facilities of the hotel are of a super high and luxurious level.

A relaxing and high level spa floor, a Japanese fusion restaurant and bar on the 8th floor with a view of the London Eye, Big Ben, London Bridge.

Comfortable bed, room service at an uncompromising level, good shower, spacious room, modern design.

It is highly recommended!",5,2023,06,25
141,"Good, modern and a little pretensious","This hotel was overall a good experience. Considering the price tag some things were not   as good as expected though:
	- The location. Although it is very central located Leicester Square does have a share of homeless people walking around and heavy ambiance in the late night. Nevertheless considering connections is as perfect as it can be in central London.
	- The rooms are a little small but nicely appointed.
	- The bathroom has a weird design with a small bathtub. Really liked the toto toilet.
	- Too much light in the room in the night. The curtains don't close completely and are a lot of mirrors reflecting the light troughout the room.
	- The hotel is big with several common areas and at reception there is no clear explanation... for instance I didn't understand if the courtyard was open or not. Nevertheless the gym, pool and spa were very straightforward and well appointed. 
	- I think it is not acceptable the in room open ear cleaners (cotonete) for hygienic reasons.
	- Lights over the bed too strong.
	- Room cleaning could be better.
The highlights of the stay:
	- The central location besides the inherent problems.
	- Lively but yet organized and not loud entrance lobby and bar.
	- The complimentary soft drinks and snacks at the secondary lobby.
	- Miller Harris bath products overall very good except the body lotion which the smell was harsh and totally off.
	- Gym and pool.
	- Overall very quiet room and halls.

So would I return there? Honestly only if I really need to stay at Leicester Square. For me it was good but not amazing stay, with an overall feeling of pretensious mood and too expensive for what it was. If you want a really luxurious expericence I would recommend to search elsewhere but at a discount this would be a nice stay. For the amount of hotels in central London this one just didn't excited me enough.. I would prefer to return to Pan Pacific for instance.

Would I recommend this hotel…. The only answer is yes",5,2023,06,21
141,Excellent service and fabulous stay,"Finding a luxury hotel in London that could accommodate an 87 year old in a Wheelchair was challenging. Most of the older hotels weren't built that way - so I needed to look for somewhere modern.

I heard about The Londoner and went to take a look around. I was met at reception by Adrian. He couldn't have been more helpful and spent time showing me all areas of the hotel and how easily and safely the wheelchair could get around. There is literally nowhere that is not accessible - from the brilliantly equipped accessible rooms, to the restaurant, the roof top bar, the swimming pool, the private residents' lounge - everywhere.

I was sold! Lliya from the reservations team then helped book 3 rooms and made sure that at all stages the needs of all our guests were taken care of.

The hotel is fabulous - beautifully appointed with luxury finishes at every turn. The views from the roof top bar are stunning, and staff upstairs were friendly, fun and helpful. The spa treatments were excellent, and the pool is beautiful.

It was a really fabulous stay, made all the more so by the fun, helpful and inclusive staff. Thanks everyone - much appreciated.",5,2023,06,20

141,Beautiful Hotel... Shame About the Service & Food!,"I have been wanting to stay at this hotel for a while now; after all I watched this hotel being built for over 8 years!  Located in Leicester Square, you can't get more central when it comes to staying in London, and if you time it just right, you might just see a film premiere happening in the Square too!

The hotel itself has been beautifully designed, and the interiors have been very well chosen.  The Lobby area is a good place to start; comfortable chairs and sofas surround a well-stocked Bar.  They have a singer/pianist play in the evenings (although she was a little too loud for my liking - I don't need to shout while I'm having drinks with friends)!

Check-in was fine and I was even offered a welcome drink while they checked me in.  I arrived early and even though the room wasn't available until later, they took my suitcase and assured me the luggage would be ready and waiting in my room when I got back.  I was also informed they would send me a text message letting me know my room number and when it was ready... and they did just that.

The hotel is all key-card access, from the lifts to the room and even the front door, if you come back late at night.
I stayed in a Deluxe King Room and it was nicely laid out.  When you first walk in, there are built in wardrobes and the open-plan bathroom.  The shower area is a good size and the controls are easy to use.  The sink area has a spacious vanity with luxury amenities but the funkiest part of the bathroom is the toilet!  It's a Japanese Toto toilet with heated seat and when you open the door, the toilet seat automatically lifts up.  It's all a bit too high-tech for me but it does work.  The king bed is comfortable, although I personally found the pillows gave me neck pain.  The windows are very well sound-proofed, and they need to be, as Leicester Square does get VERY noisy at night, and even during the day.

Now so far this appears to be an excellent review for the hotel, but that is not the case.  The two biggest issues are the service and the food.
Firstly the food; I only ate breakfast at the hotel but it was not good.  If your having to pay for breakfast it's going to cost you £39.00 each, and believe me its not worth it.  The buffet selection is not great - some yogurts, various fresh fruit chopped up, a few bits of sliced cold meats, some generic chesses (all cut up into triangles), smoked salmon and some focaccia bread.  There are also various pastries, you have to toast your own bread and there are various fruit juices to chose from too.  Now this all seems fine when you read it, but the quality of the produce was not great.  The hot selection offered in a menu, was small and again items that were ordered failed to live up to expectations.  For example, the omelette I ordered did not come with the right fillings I asked for, and when it was re-done for me it still wasn't right - not enough cheese!  The full English my friend ordered, again had the wrong items - fried eggs instead of scrambled, he wanted hash browns and baked beans but none were on the plate.  The next day I ordered the Crepe Soufflée Pancakes but when they arrived, the texture was wrong.  Should pancakes crumble?  I asked.  The answer I got was, ""that's the way we cook them"".  Hmmmmmmmm!  On top of that, all the hot food arrived lukewarm.

But it's the service that really lets the hotel down, especially in Whitcomb's restaurant.  Most of the restaurant staff clearly don't know what they are doing and just stand around looking confused.  No condiments were offered with my friends full English breakfast.  When I asked for mustard for my omelette, the waitress replied confused, ""mustard sauce""?  She had no idea what I wanted.  Drinks that I ordered, were not correct either - an Iced Coffee with only one shot of espresso, came with two shots.   The final straw came with regard to paying the bill - it arrived and without showing me the bill first, the waiter took my bank card and tapped the machine.  He then gave me my card back, along with a receipt and just walked away.  The ONLY member of the staff that clearly knew what they were doing was Gabor Torok - General Manager of Whitcomb's.  He took charge of my many issues and did his very best to make my breakfast experience better; I only hope I receive the refund he promised me in due course.

My last words are to the senior management at The Londoner - however well designed and constructed your building is or how beautiful your interiors or comfortable your bedrooms are, the life blood of a hotel will always be your staff.  If you do not employ the right staff and train them well, then your hotel will fail!
I would like to go back, but for the price I paid for a 2 nights stay, it's just not worth it when the service and the food is that bad.

141,First time to London and the Londoner made it extra special!,"From check-in to check-out and everything in between my stay was outstanding. The staff was very helpful. My room was quiet, luxurious and extremely comfortable. The food and beverage was great. My only negative was I did not enjoy my experience at the 8 Londoner….It felt like a nightclub. I was traveling solo and my service there was very dismissive. Other then that my stay was amazing. I can not wait to go back!",5,2023,06,19
141,A new luxury hotel that disappoints.,"I doubt we'd return to The Londoner. Its location on Leicester Square  is too frenetic, especially at weekends when thousands pour into the West End and it is difficult to walk on the streets. 
The rooms are nice enough until you discover there is nowhere to store your empty suitcase, that the space for your clothes is totally inadequate - a narrow hanging space and one tiny drawer, shameful for a brand new hotel. And nowhere to sit comfortably - just one desk chair and a small,  hard disagreeable couch. Ours was not a room designed for hanging out in. 
And insufficient lighting in the dark bathroom, although it did have a rather remarkable toilet that hummed and gurgled and was forever cleaning itself. 
The good included great service, spotless housekeeping and a nice breakfast  And more thought had obviously been given to the ambience of the public spaces.
Really 3.5 out of 5. ",4,2023,06,16
141,In the beating heart of London,Lovely modern hotel in the heart of London. Stayed for four nights staff were amazing and food was great. It quite simply has the best hotel gym I have ever encountered. Room was bright and modern. I have no complaints only compliments for this place.,5,2023,06,09

141,Beautiful and perfectly located,"A stunning hotel in an unreal location on Leicester Square, just round the corner from Chinatown and a few minutes walk from Covent Garden. The hotel’s interior is impeccably designed down to every last detail, both in terms of aesthetics and function — it’s easy to forget you’re in a hotel, let alone central London, thanks to the excellent soundproofing, furnishings and facilities. The staff were all at the top of their game, and we particularly enjoyed The Residence to relax away from the chaos of Leicester Square.",5,2023,06,02
141,"Beautiful looking hotel, the worst customer service! Look after your valuables when there!","Beautiful hotel, such a pity that they have the worst customer care! The staff at their restaurant downstairs is so rude. Their security team, not helpful at all.  We had our phone stolen at their establishment. We reported the matter within 5min of leaving the phone in their bathroom as it was immediately gone. A member of their security team, Rollie lied to us and said they looked at footage and we did not enter the establishment with the phone. The hotel next door helped us and showed footage that actually shows us walking in holding the phone and going to the bathroom with the phone. We had 4 rooms booked at The Londoner as a group of friends, a disgrace to be treated this way!! The security team now confirms us walking in with the phone, meaning on the 1st night, they did not bother with our report! The phone is still missing with no answer. So look after your things extra when at this hotel.",2,2023,06,01

141,Great place to stay in London,"Room was very nice and comfortable. Concierge was very helpful on recommendations. Overall, the staff was very kind, helpful, and hospitable at every interaction. Hotel was spotless. Location was fantastic just off of Leicester Square. My wife and I had massages at the spa which were also great. When we come back to London, this will definitely be at the top of the list to stay.",5,2023,05,27
141,Style Over Comfort,"First the good parts.  The staff was wonderful and couldn't do enough for you.  The location is great for theater - short walk to most of our venues and to the National Gallery.  

But we never felt truly comfortable.  The design of the hotel seems to emphasize style over comfort.  Our room didn't have a comfortable place to sit.  The Residence was advertised as a comfortable retreat, but we found it  stark and uninviting with noise from the lobby. Breakfast was OK.  We had one dinner in the restaurant and it was average.

If we go back to London, would probably stay in the Leicester Square area, but in another hotel.    ",4,2023,05,24
141,"Interesting hotel, but it's not the best in London","Right in the midst of the busiest part of London, it's an amazing location if you want to be in the most touristy part of the city. 
The hotel left me with mixed feelings, but I didn't feel like it lived up to my expectations from what I'd read online. 
The welcome was great, but then after that I felt like one of many hundreds of people coming in and out of the hotel on an hourly basis. The guest lounge area was a nice retreat but as a solo traveller you had to pass through the very busy bar full of people dressed to the nines, to get to it, which was intimidating. Once there though, it was quiet, relaxing and there were drinks and treats to help yourself to. 
The corridors to the bedrooms made my eyes hurt, I'm not sure what feel the designers were going for there. The bedroom was fine, but some odd design choices with bathroom layout. 
The gym was well equipped with a variety of modern kit to suit different styles of workouts which was great. 
In summary, it's trying hard but is a bit forgettable and now that I've stayed there I probably won't go back, but instead try one of the many other new 5-star hotels in London. ",4,2023,05,23

141,"True Luxury! Great hotel, great team! ","My wife gifted me a night at the luxurious Londoner hotel and let me tell you, amazing hotel. I walk in and the guys that work there are simply amazing, friendly and very profesional. As soon as i got to the hotel, a doorman opened the door for me, i felt special, then two guys, a lady and a man in well groomed uniforms are waiting to greet you, you feel even more special. They take you to reception where you are checked in by a lovely charming receptionist, you cant stop smiling at how nice this guys are. The suite was incredible, very spacious with super beautiful view of central London's skyline including Westminster palace and the London eye. My wife took me down to the Spa with swimming pool, sauna and other amenities. To my amazement its underground but feels like your in a beach resort in the Caribbean. The bed, i slept like a baby of how comfortable  it was, It felt like you were floating in the a cloud in the sky. Sadly, there were some things that i missed like the rooftop restaurant and whisky bar but for sure will cover when my wife takes me again 🫣.

141,A beautiful hotel in the heart of Central London.,"The Londoner, located in the heart of Leicester Square, offers a location that can present both advantages and challenges. During our stay leading up to the coronation weekend, road closures created some inconvenience as we were unable to be dropped off or picked up directly in front of the hotel. However, the central location proved to be highly advantageous for exploring the vibrant theater district, enjoying the numerous dining options in the area, and indulging in shopping excursions to Piccadilly, Soho, and Covent Garden.

One outstanding feature of the hotel is its relatively new construction, with an exquisite design that leaves a lasting impression. The junior suite we stayed in was meticulously appointed, providing breathtaking views of London's picturesque roofscape. The luxurious bathroom, complete with Miller Harris toiletries, added an extra touch of indulgence.

The spa and gym facilities, located in the basement, were truly impressive and offered a welcome retreat from the bustling atmosphere of central London. Alongside the Residence, these amenities provided a serene and tranquil environment. The complimentary drinks and nibbles throughout the day further enhanced the sense of hospitality.

When it came to dining, we only tried Whitcomb's by the entrance for a pre-theatre dinner, and we were delighted to find that reservations were not necessary. The food was delicious, the service attentive, and the overall experience offered exceptional value for money. Breakfast, served at the same restaurant, presented a combination of buffet and à la carte options. Although priced at £39, it is worth trying at perhaps once, or if it is included in your room rate.

The hotel's newness and exquisite design undoubtedly contribute to its overall appeal, creating a memorable and enjoyable stay for guests and visitors.",5,2023,05,18
141,absolutely wonderful night,"I stayed in this hotel 4 times before, but no one welcomed me hard and made my day special like Mr Rohan, he offered me coffee for welcoming, the check in process it was so easy and quick, thank a lot,
Mr Rohan",5,2023,05,15
141,The Londoner Hotel is  exceptional,"
Upon our arrival at The Londoner Hotel, we were immediately struck by the exceptional level of service and attention to detail provided by the staff. The head concierge, Tom, went above and beyond to offer recommendations and ensure our stay was comfortable and enjoyable. Their extensive knowledge of the area was impressive, and we appreciated their willingness to exceed our expectations.

We were also impressed by the reception staff, particularly Rohan, who warmly welcomed us upon arrival and ensured that all of our needs were met throughout our stay. They were always available to offer advice and assistance, ensuring that our stay was stress-free.

The Stage Bar provided a sophisticated atmosphere for an evening cocktail, with expert staff like Beet who delighted us with their skill and friendliness, he is now our 3years old daughter's best friend. The selection of drinks was impressive, and the attentive service provided by the bar staff made our experience truly exceptional.

The restaurant Whitcombs, overseen by Chef Ranjit, was a true delight. The food was outstanding, with a wide range of dishes. The quality of the ingredients and attention to the presentation was exceptional. The warm and welcoming service provided by the staff, particularly Olia, was attentive yet unobtrusive, making us feel truly valued as guests.

We also appreciated the outstanding service provided by the IT manager, who ensured that any IT issues we encountered during our stay were resolved quickly and effectively.

Overall, our experience at The Londoner Hotel was exceptional. This brand new Green hotel boasts the latest technology and impressive attention to art, as well as live music on the stage. We highly recommend this hotel to anyone looking for a truly memorable stay in London.",5,2023,05,14
141,A must visit,"The Londoner hotel was an experience on its own. We absolutely loved our stay there, the view was breathtaking and because of its location it was a perfect honeymoon experience for us. 
There service is exceptional. 
Can’t wait to visit again.",5,2023,05,14
141,Wow!! Great hotel and great service!!,"This past week my family and I stayed at The Londoner. It was one of the best hotel stays that we have ever experienced - and we will absolutely return. I cannot recommend this hotel more highly, for the following reasons, and especially the level of service that was provided.

We had two rooms - a corner suite for my wife and I, and a deluxe king for my two daughters. Each of the rooms was extremely comfortable, and quite big for central London. I have stayed in London many times, and these beds were the most comfortable I have slept in. The hotel is new - completed in 2021 - and the rooms feel like it and look like it. The shower was amazing! For being right next to Leicester Square, the rooms are essentially sound-proofed - very quiet rooms. We had access to the lounge, which was great for a quick drink and snack, or some tea - this is exclusive to those staying at the hotel. Great restaurants/bars are right in the hotel, with frequent live music at The Stage on the lobby level.

The location cannot be beat. Most of the popular attractions in central London are well within walking distance. The Leicester Square tube stop is a 3 minute walk. But we really enjoyed being able to have a great dinner within walking distance at one of the many restaurants in Covent Garden and the West End area, and then walk to a show - with the ability to stop at our hotel room in between. 

But the best part of our stay was the service provided by everyone at The Londoner. Everyone had a smile, and literally everyone provided us with assistance at some point during our 8 day stay. I can’t remember all the names, but for sure Selbi, Shane, Visar and Rohan really stood out. Rohan and Selbi provided guided tours of the features of the hotel, Shane arranged wonderful surprises for us one night which were waiting for us when we returned from a show, and Visar always greeted us with a happy smile and was a joy to talk to. The biggest star of the week was Rohan. He assisted us in multiple ways during the week, and I really felt like my family and I were very important to him. He provided great service and excellent suggestions, with personality and with a smile. He was indispensable to us. Fantastic job Rohan, thank you! We would come back to The Londoner just because of Rohan and the great team at the Londoner. 

I have tried to think of ways our stay could have been better. The only thing I can think of is that it would have been nice to also have some cookies with the tea in the private lounge. Such a minor detail, but I’m trying to convey how great our stay was. Of course a full afternoon tea was available every day at The Stage. 

This was really a wonderful, 5-star stay (that evidently some very famous people who we saw already know) that we will remember for a long time. We can hardly wait to come back!! Thank you to The Londoner!!! ",5,2023,05,09
141,Contemporary Luxury stay in the heart of London,"Centrally located on the edge of Leiceister Square, convenient if you are a theatre goer and easy access to the tube, too. Excellent professional service from all hotel staff, eager to help. Excellent morning buffet breakfast in lobby restaurant, with omelette station or order from menu too. We had dinner one night there too and the food was outstanding. Very large super well equipped hotel gym and nice pool with resting stations, spa services. I hosted friends for coffee / drinks in the lobby lounge a great meeting place. We got upgraded to a corner junior suite, huge corner bathroom with floor to ceiling windows. I disliked the ' fancy ' toilet with auto lift lid heated seat, bidet function, not my thing. I wish however contemporary hotel bathroom designers would think to add a few more hooks and towel rods to hold towels, toiletries. Large pump bottles for lotions, shampoo. Turn down service. I did find the suite lighting to be not so user friendly, lights were not put on dimmers and lamps both floor and wall ones not individually controlled. Top notch luxury stay, highly recommend ! ",5,2023,05,07
141,fine hotel in a great location,A great 4 day vacation at the hotel.  Perfect location in central London.  Not as traditional as the Savoy or fancy as the Corinthia -- but a fine hotel with great and eager service.  particularly recommended for people who want to be in the middle of town,5,2023,04,30
141,mostly good,"I 80% really liked this hotel, hence the 4 star review. 

The decor was really nice. Tasteful but not too understated. My room was on a lower floor so the view was slightly obstructed but I could see the London Eye. The mirrored ceiling was really well designed and made the room seem light and open. The bed was extremely comfortable. I absolutely loved that all the toilets had a built-in electronic bidet! However, in our bathroom there was an art piece that was a letter from a government minister with most of the words blacked out so that all you can read is ""i hate poor people"". I'm not sure if it's meant to be satirical but in an expensive, opulent hotel, it didn't seem right. 

The staff were all really friendly and pleasant. The only issue was that somehow our credit card details were not being held on the system meaning that we had to pay as we go rather than charging to the room. This was annoying and took 3 or 4 members of staff to realise what had happened and resolve it. 

The spa was nice and fairly quiet when we were there.",4,2023,04,27
141,Style over substance ,"STYLE OVER SUBSTANCE 

Nothing upsets me more having to leave such a negative review from  a break away which was  supposed to be such an enjoyable,  luxurious experience.

Pro
Clean and Beautiful hotel,  decor decadent, excellent facilities, central  location, pool area wonderful. 

Cons 
Far too many to mention, the administration and service side is severely lacking.

 I phoned direct to the hotel for what I thought would be a seamless personal service.  2 nights, 2 people, 2 rooms. Upon arrival I was told it was 3 rooms, this was supposed to removed at checkin?? However I was later charged nearly £500 (during which I was eating a meal and had to leave to try and sort out) I am still awaiting a refund 
New card details not updated at checkin to second room. Therefore no information of the second guest available. Making for an uncomfortable and stressful experience all round and especially after our spa treatments. We were hounded around the hotel as if we were criminals.

Pressurised to leave a gratuity tip on the invoice by male spa therapist.

Inconsistent and unstandardised spa treatments. Cut short by 20 minutes.

I’ve had a more seamless personal experience at a budget hotel. 

",1,2023,04,19
141,Top class hotel,"In the heart of London so location is perfect for everything, the hotel is done to a very high standard, decor is fantastic and has great facilities 
The staff are very well trained and friendly 
And in our opinion the value for money is good considering the location and quality of what you get ",5,2023,04,17
141,Not sure I will be booking this hotel again when staying in London,"I booked this hotel last year knowing i was coming with my sister in law over Easter weekend as a Christmas gift,the hotel itself looks amazing from the outside and as you enter into the reception area it’s beautifully designed and there was plenty of staff on hand to help us when we arrived to check in and even found our room was ready when we arrived which was great news.

The hotel is stunning inside and in a prime location for shopping/sightseeing and going to the theatre…everything I booked was in walking distance which was great and only a five minute walk to Covent Garden which is always a lovely place to visit and enjoy a bite to eat.

However there was some downsides that put me off this hotel…first I noticed more money had been taken off my bank account than the amount of the hotel cost (I booked this on booking.com) to then find out that £150.00 per night is taken out which I found was very steep…I would have been happy to have my card scanned and money taken if anything had been damaged etc but £300.00 was a lot of money to come out and not go back into my account for a good few days after (this www something I wasn’t aware of when staying) 

We also got ready for bed on the Friday eve to hear bells going off all the time,myself and my sister in law could not go to sleep as they were very loud and we couldn’t work out to begin with what it was…we then found out this was the lifts as they have a very loud noise when leaving a floor and setting off…very annoying when all you can hear in your room is the noise of bells constantly we just wanted a good nights sleep! 

We then had someone come to the room to listen to see exactly what it was and said they would move us to another room in about 10mins this took well over an hour and by this time it was after midnight…we found it so bad that things weren’t sorted sooner especially for such a high standard of hotel…things like this put you off and we were not happy with the way things were dealt!

This was meant to be a five star hotel and in my eyes it definitely wasn’t,I have stayed in many hotels and unfortunately this hotel was stunning inside but the mishaps with staffing and not been looked after let it down,such a shame.

I’m not sure we will be returning here",3,2023,04,16
141,Luxurious stay with a perfect location,"We have just returned from a wonderful stay at The Londoner. It is a beautiful hotel, located in the heart of everything. Our plans for dinner and a theatre show were easily executed due to the close proximity of the Hotel. Stepping into it after the hustle and bustle of Leicester Square you immediately feel a sense of serenity. It is a luxurious hotel but also extremely welcoming. Every single member of staff I encountered made me feel welcomed and important. Even in the lifts or corridors, walking past someone who was busy doing their job, they all took the time to say hello and ask how we were. It was very impressive. 
The spa is amazing and the breakfast is delicious! This was our 2nd stay at The Londoner and we had received a complimentary upgrade, without a doubt, we will be back!",5,2023,04,16
141,Ok for a comfortable stay at a price ,This is in an exceptional location.  It is a comfortable if rather soulless hotel.  The bars are very expensive indeed and a bit pretentious. Staff were pretty friendly.    Bed was comfortable and my husband enjoyed the over-engineered robotic toilets.,4,2023,04,15
141,Dreadful comms and failure to get the basics right.,"I’ve never felt compelled to write a review while still staying in a hotel before but The Londoner has been a massive disappointment on a number of fronts and the good things have been seriously outweighed by the poor. 

The biggest issue has been a sequence of fundamental communication failures. These began before arrival. A series of text messages prompted us to pre-check-in which we did. We were given a choice of room which we selected and the. Pointed towards the hotels ‘Edward’ AI concierge app. This completely failed to function and we were unable to login. On arrival the room TV advertised us another app ‘The Londoner’ which promised similar features. This was also an abject failure with total failure to log us in. 

Arrival was also poor. Our case was whisked away, which I am generally fine with but it failed to reappear for 90+minutes. It took three calls to reception after finally getting to our room before it appeared. The point of taking our luggage is surely to ease the check in. However we hung out in the room for ages waiting for it despite being told that it would be awaiting us in the room. 

We sat with a staff member as she checked us in. This began by telling us the pre-check in room was no longer available and we were being given another room. I can accept this, but after nearly an hour the only way we were alerted that our room was ready was via text message despite being previously told that she’d come and let us know once the room was ready. I had to approach the desk and inquire again. Frustrating. 

The next major failure was around explaining how things worked. Nobody explained The Residence, which is a residents club within the hotel. A fairly key element seeing as they talk it up in the literature on their website. 

The biggest issue, and frankly the deal breaker was the failure, anywhere, to explain that The Retreat spa which is described as accessible to all residents, needs to be booked. This visit was planned to celebrate my wife’s birthday and visiting the Spa was something she was hugely looking forward to. As nobody had told us the spa hours, I searched on the website and eventually found them. I noticed, by chance that spa visits, even without treatments, needed to be booked. Calling reception to book this in, I was immediately told that there was zero availability. This was hugely frustrating and super disappointing. My wife was massively looking forward to the spa, but we weren’t given any of the information we’d have needed to actually book a visit. This is complete comms failure in my view has massively impacted our stay. 

On top of a bunch of other detractors it seems that the ‘Super Boutique’ vibe The Londoner wants to project starts and finishes with the blurb in adverts and their website. There’s a complete lack of customer service or good communication - these are the elements that separate a great hotel from the competition and The Londoner has dropped the ball completely here. 

Interestingly enough a pre-visit skim of the TripAdvisor reviews flagged the poor check-in experience and I was gutted to find that they weren’t isolated incidents. 

In short, poor. Don’t buy the hype. London is filled with fine hotels. This isn’t one of them.",2,2023,04,12
141,Family vacation to London,"Positives:
1. Best location for tourists like us.  5min walk to Covent Garden Market and Piccadilly Circus.
2. Most comfortable bed I have slept in.  Beats beds at Four Seasons, Park Hyatt and Mandarin.
3. New facility - clean and modern.

Negatives:
1. 90% of the employees are not properly trained to work at a 4/5 star hotel.  50% appear to be working at a hotel for the first time.
2. Not a kid friendly hotel.  Access to rooftop restaurant/bar and swimming pool are highly restrictive to kids.  Makes it a great place for couples.
2. Check in and check out process is long and tedious.  On-line pre check-in is a waste of time and useless - didn't get the room I booked.  Where is my 2 pounds they charged me for pre check in!

Overall, Londoner is a new facility in a great location but people managing and servicing it are subpar.",4,2023,04,09
141,Dreadful,"Check in not ready at 3pm. Supposed to text when available. Never happened.
Room small. No handheld steamer in room.
Lacking any space to out clothes I.e. drawers. 
No ome at the hotel knew when 8th floor bar opened... 5pm later worked our, or how to ge to it. Just saidnthey were new . This was three staff who said this.
Later on horrendous experience with guest bar at 1230pm. Door staff said bar open as did staff at residents bar. However some obnoxious staff member intervened and refused to serve one drink. Then subsequently asked for room number. When questioned why said it was his given right to ask. Here for another two nights so will find out who this staff member is. So far hugely disappointing and one of the worst hotels I've stayed in for the money.",1,2023,04,08
141,The most incredible 5 star hotel!,"This hotel is in a league of its own and by far the best of all The 5 star hotels we have stayed at, not only on this family vacation but overall. 
The rooms are amazing and every detail has been thought of. The slippers (a small added luxury at a hotel) are the best! The ambiance of the hotel is superb and we all missed this hotel. As a family of 6 staying in various parts of America and london on our trip, i asked everyone which 5 star hotel was their favorite and the vote of The Londoner was unanimous!! The only suggestion I would have would be for breakfast to be more of a buffet style with hot breakfast options, other than that they have left no stone unturned. 

We will absolutely be back to this hotel!
The toilet in the hotel rooms is next level!! You’ll never be able to enjoy another hotel after this 🤣

141,Very good hotel but 'not quite' excellent.,"Loved our stay at The Londoner. Booked it for it's excellent location and close proximity to parking. My son and daughter-in-law had stayed previously and highly recommended it.
Upon arrival it was apparent that we were arriving at the start of a very busy weekend with various functions and events being hosted by the hotel. Despite this we received a warm welcome from the reception staff and a detailed guided tour of the hotel. However, the staff did struggle to cope in a few areas. The issues that particularly niggled me started with the rooms not being ready when we were told in advance of our arrival that they would both be available. We then had to wait thirty minutes for our bags to arrive in the room (will definitely keep them with us next time). The milk cartons in our room weren't replenished on day two so I requested some and was told they'd be sent straight up - nothing arrived. Service in The Stage Bar was slow and unfriendly, and despite ordering two of the exact same drinks one was served in the wrong glass and without ice and lemon. Nothing major I know, but these things do add up.
Our room was very comfortable, spotlessly clean, with a great functional bathroom area and the best toilet ever! 
Great breakfast and very efficient service.
We used most of the facilities during our stay, including several of the hotels bars and the spa and, apart from what was probably just a blip with the service, we thoroughly enjoyed our stay and wouldn't hesitate in recommending the hotel.    ",4,2023,03,31
141,First time in London and The Londoner was WOW!,"This hotel was exceptional. The hotel was very clean and comfortable, and I felt safe and very special during my stay. The room was very clean and quiet and had everything I needed. The staff was very friendly and accommodating and made me feel at home. The food and drinks were sensational, and the atmosphere was electric, yet homey at the same time. The amenities were just what I needed after a long day of work and sightseeing. ",5,2023,03,27
141,"Amazing, relaxing experience in a unique hotel","Amazing Hotel, excellent food, service and ambience. Will definitely visit again.  The hotel offers a unique experience by being able to make you feel like you’ve been transported to another place.  8th Floor Japanese bar could have been in Tokyo! Attention to the little details is superb and the residents lounge is a fantastic feature offering free soft drinks and a place to relax.",5,2023,03,27
141,Excellant ,"Brilliant value for money, very impressive rooms and bathrooms. Breakfast was amazing, both with service and food. Pool was nice, although rather busy, with empty seats with towels on. my only slight critique was the bar downstairs, just before 5pm, only 1 member of staff on, although I could see another 3 waiting in the wings, chatting to each other. I had 2 glasses of Cab., the last one had loads of sediment in, and when I mentioned it, the bar tender tried to explain that was the nature of the wine ! Having been to Napa for the last 20 years, I politely informed him that was not the case. To be fair, he didn't charge me for the last glass. Would we go again, most definitely , great location and hotel 5 Stars !",5,2023,03,24
141,Super Boutique Hotel Experience in London,This is a great hotel with outstanding service. Warm welcome upon check in and they do a great job explaining the amenities the hotel has to offer. The rooms are very thoughtfully designed the hotel provides everything you need both for leisure and business. The highlight was the Residence and the Gym. ,5,2023,03,24
141,5 Star Service in the Heart of The West End,From check in to check out we were looked after by every member of staff so politely. The check in experience by Michelle was flawless as she explained everything so well about the hotel. Leo our bell boy who had the bags in the room before we arrived. Our room had a gorgeous view over the hustle and bustle of Leicester Square but not once were we disrupted. We didn’t have dinner in Whitcomb’s but the breakfast the following morning was really fresh and the service topped it. Highly recommend the pancakes ! The Spa area in the evening is just bliss. Such a nice atmosphere to relax in. The live music around the hotel has so much to offer as well from acoustic piano at The Stage to upbeat Japanese hits at the 8. Overall a fantastic stay in a perfectly located hotel.,5,2023,03,23
141,An amazing stay at an amazing hotel,"I would like to take a moment to write a note about our stay at this fabulous hotel. We stayed for eight nights as well as booking a room for our friends to join us for my wife’s birthday and greatly enjoyed every moment of our stay. 

The front desk and check in process was very good and went extremely smoothly. We had booked through the Amex fine hotels and resort program and were delighted with the room upgrade, chocolates, champagne and many other extras.

The breakfast each morning was amazing with a buffet option as well as an included al a carte menu (all included through Amex) and the Whitcomb’s staff should be congratulated. 

Tom at concierge went out of his way to help us at every turn as did all of the concierge staff and bellmen.  

Stefani at the Retreat took care of all of our requests as well as sought out some outside help for a consult for some neck issues I was having. 

Another standout of the hotel was the bar tenders (Giuseppe and Dario) at the Y-Bar and the Piano Bar. These  were two standout young men that made off menu cocktails for us. Each drink exceeded the next and their knowledge of spirts, flavors and mixology was amazing. This bespoke offering of cocktails was in keeping with the vision of the hotel and will keep us coming back. ",5,2023,03,22
141,The Londoner is the place to stay,"The Londoner is a beautiful hotel, the decor is very modern and chic, with gorgeous lounge / bar areas to relax with a cup of tea or even a glass of wine / Champagne. The staff are very welcoming, friendly and helpful. The hotel is in a fabulous location, and close to all local immunities. Definitely check out the spa, you would never believe you were on the basement level, the Gym is also full of top of the range equipment. We stayed in a deluxe city view room, even though very beautiful, I found it lacking storage space, and the bathroom (which isn’t really bathroom) more like an side add on to the room. The toilet seats are however a quirky touch, with their very own heated seats. I would give the hotel a 4.5 if it was available, it’s a definite recommend, however, if I was to stay again I would look at a bigger room option.",4,2023,03,22
141,Simply Amazing! ,Simply amazing from start to finish! I came to celebrate my birthday with my best friend's 60th Birthday I am confident to say that this was the best decision ever made!  Special thanks goes to Shane  who had gone above and beyond for us with the room arrangements! Additionally William and Rohan who checked us in. All of of these gentleman are a vital asset to this hotel and a shining example of five star hospitality. I can not express enough how amazing all of them treated us during our stay. The whole team was extremly polite and professional and everyone I came across had a smile on their face. The location was extremly convenient and the breakfast was amazing. I simply can not think of a simple flaw that occured during my stay. Once again  I would like to express my gratitude to the whole Londoner team for making this special occasion memorable and it would be a mistake not to stay here if you are visiting London. ,5,2023,03,18
141,The Londoner puts the ER in LONDON!,"The Londoner is an excellent location in the heart of London with easy access to several tube stops nearby. 
Modern in design the hotel offers good customer service. A couple of glitches but nothing that was ruining the stay. 
Huge Lobby bar, great private restaurant not the 2nd floor, and a really nice indoor Pool and Spa. 
Little disappointed that FHR didn't get us a better upgrade as the room was a little small, but average for London. 
Breakfast was a nice Buffett.  Great Drinks.  Cool Japanese garden on the top floor with great views. ",4,2023,03,15
141,Great hotel - shame about some of the clientele ,"We visited on a winter weekend. 
The team make you feel welcome from the moment you step inside. 
The hotel is a little difficult to navigate with the pool and spa being located via a separate set of lifts. 
The rooms are fantastically appointed and quiet which is a rarity in Central London - especially on Leicester Square. 
The food and drink at the hotel is expensive and on weekends the Champagne bar becomes a brunch spot for non-residents - lots of people who want to be 'seen' at The Londoner. We had one drink and left. 
The most off-putting part of the hotel was the pool - lots of families and couples lounging in their robes in the cabanas all day, which is quite off-putting when you're going for a swim. It was much better going early AM on a weekday.
The breakfast was excellent - try the almond croissant. We don't have children and didn't appreciate being sat in an area filled with lots of screaming children, especially as there was lots of space in the bottom area of the restaurant - but we know this is just preference. 
We might go back, but it felt a bit too 'cool' for us. It was more about appearance than substance. ",4,2023,03,14
141,Weekend at The Londoner,"My husband booked a Saturday night stay at The Londoner to celebrate my birthday and we were very impressed!  We were met by the welcoming doorman and greeted at reception by Debora who checked us in and gave us a free upgrade to a room with a view of Leicester Square.  She then took us to our room to show us all the amenities.  She was very friendly and welcoming and showed us how to link our iphone up to the tv so we could stream programmes, showed us how to use the automated Japanese toilet with a heated seat (tip: if the loo doesn't flush you can press the bar at the back) and explained that we had complimentary water in the room which could be replenished 24 hours a day if we requested.  She talked us through all the other room amenities and answered any questions we had. The bed was very comfortable with lovely pillows (my husband likes firm and I like soft but we both liked these pillows!)  We went down to the spa where we had booked a cabana for the afternoon and Steph looked after us and made sure our water was always refilled and that we were happy with everything.  The Londoner has resident only areas and we used the residents lounge were you can get complimentary snacks, tea, coffee and soft drinks throughout the day and a selection of breakfast items in the morning.  Mario looked after us and showed us the Whiskey room which is also for residents and was very friendly and informative.  We would like to say thank you to Debora, Steph and Mario for looking after us so well and hopefully next time we can stay longer! ",5,2023,03,14
141,The best hotel in the west end,"Best hotel in London period.
Very clean and organised 
The stuff was kind and nice 
I’m sure that I’m going to visit again very soon 
If you are interested in staying in a hotel in London this is the one 
",5,2023,03,13
141,Feeling at home,"We are regular customers since one year now and it is always a great pleasure! Excellent food and drinks/wines, very very clean rooms and excellent mattresses, the courtesy of the staff .... all excellent!!! ",5,2023,03,13
141,All OK - Decent Location,"Nice Stay - Had to ask for an ironing board (Should have folded up my shirt properly) But no issues. Was delivered very quickly. Great bar on the top floor. Plesant stay, surprisingly quiet for the location, probably needs a magnet on the curtains as the sunlight creeps into them, but that's a minor issue and only an issue 1st thing when you wake up. 

No issues - Would go back. Funky sink, in the room, but round the corner, I quite liked it!",4,2023,03,12
141,Great hotel,"We were able to check in at 12-45 which was a real bonus. A fantastic welcome and we had a lovely room overlooking Leicester Square.

Very modern hotel the toilet will be a talking point for weeks to come, we loved the heated seat etc.
A lovely meal in whitcombes and a good breakfast the following morning, although it did feel a bit cramped and by the time we left there was quite a big queue

All the staff were both friendly and couldn’t do enough for you, great service in the stage bar.

Can’t wait to return😁",5,2023,03,12
141,Good not great,"Visited for 2 nights for our anniversary. Overall it’s pretty good… I guess for 5 star your expectations are super high so I think they can do better in areas. Most staff are helpful and welcoming and even when they don’t get it right first time they try to set it right so your happy. Some are new and really inexperienced so you need to be patient. Shane the Customer Relations Manager is brilliant and leads the way on a 5 star customer service! We had dinner at restaurant 8 which was ok… pretty overpriced for what it is with some good dishes and some that need more work … extremely dark setting but service is good. 

Breakfast is a real disappointment at £39 pp, over crowded and very noisy.  We were sitting on top of another couple and it felt very public and not special, you could be at any hotel or 4 star where it could be nicer. Omelettes are good but long delays. Coffee is not great and could be better sourced. Pastries are ok … Waitrose are better !
Our table was crooked and they use a wine cork to keep it stable which is laughable. 

The cocktails served at the bars are good I would say and the bar staff are knowledgeable and attentive on the drinks. The man showing us into the bar on our last night couldn’t have cared less with no customer service skills. We ended up finding our own table as he was rude to my wife.

The king size deluxe city view room is tight and our view was of a building opposite which was unbearable really to look at for the price charged. 
The spa/ pool is nice especially at night, my wife had a facial and said it was very good. I liked the gym with state of the art equipment and excellent showers etc.
The residence area is really unimpressive and we were sent there for a cocktail when we arrived but it was full of people on pc’s working… not the ambience I would want.
The dinner at Whitcombs was excellent, I can’t fault anything. The German waiter we had was a brilliant guy and attentive, knowledgeable especially as he was training the staff.
I would come back but I will also look at other 5 stars in the city to compare and ensure you get a better all round experience.",4,2023,03,12
141,Amazing experience!!! Lovely hotel and wonderful staff. ,"All I can say is wow. Our experience at the Londoner Hotel was unlike anything else. From the moment we walked in, we were greeted with immense kindness and hospitality by the wonderful employees. We had just gotten engaged a few days prior to us checking in and Rohan (our favorite staff member) went above and beyond to get us upgraded to a corner room suite where we could see famous city sites like Big Ben, the London Eye, and Houses of Parliament. The details in the room were incredible! I do not think I will ever stop talking about the amazing toilet haha and the bed and pillows felt like we were sleeping on clouds. Everytime we left for the day, we came back to our room all tidied up with fresh towels, fresh water bottles, and more. 

I specifically want to highlight Rohan, the lovely employee who made our stay all the more wonderful. He was so kind and hospitable and was always making sure we felt comfortable throughout our stay. It was so nice to see his smiling face in the morning and evening as we came and went from the hotel. Rohan and the rest of the staff made our stay at the Londoner feel that we were not so far away from home. 

All in all, I will always recommend the Londoner to anyone who is traveling to London. Truly the best 5 star hotel I have ever stayed in and if I could rate 10 stars, I would!!! Thank you to the Londoner for this amazing experience!",5,2023,03,09
141,One of the best hotels in London,"An outstanding hotel. Very clean, very friendly and helpful staff, very good location. Special thanks to  Samra (hope I wrote her name correctly) who was taking care of us in the spa area on Sunday.  They thought of everything also regarding sustainability with using less plastic and more glass or paper. Also the restaurant fantastic",5,2023,03,08
141,"Small wardrobes and poor ""free"" food","Nice building and swimming pool but the whole Residence thing is a joke.
Free food offerings are awful (parmisan, artichokes, goates  cheese, etc) so no one eats them. The ""Free"" breakfast is EXREMELY limited on choices, it not a ""buffet"" as we all know. 
If you do book ma,e sure it has a room with a proper wardrobe. Our was 10inches wide, yes 10"".
Heated toilet seat great though.",3,2023,03,07
141,Good,"That was a lovely service by Bryan. Good meal. Steak good and nice environment. Lovely evening. Second time I came here. Price is not low, but kind of worth it with good sauce and fried squids. Might come again when I walk by here someday. ",5,2023,03,06
141,A truly wonderful experience,"Yesterday I've been with few friends to celebrate at the Stage bar inside the hotel.

The atmosphere is fantastic, the team was superb and in particular Razvan the Bar manager. He assisted us since we arrived until we left.

I can say a gentleman and a real man of hospitality that he really knows how to make you feel at home.

We will definitely come back.

Highly recommended.",5,2023,03,01
141,Fantastic Cocktail experience,"We had an amazing cocktail experience last night with other 4 friends at the Stage bar. The description of the cocktail, made from the signature list was beautiful and I want to say thanks  Razvan for looking after us. We will back for another cocktail experience. ",5,2023,03,01
141,Great hotel and best hotel gym I’ve even seen.,"We stayed for 1 night in February and The Londoner is our new favourite hotel in London.

The rooms were great, staff really welcoming and the food was excellent.

The Spa is incredible and so relaxing, you wouldn’t never guess you are in the heart of Leicester Square.

Biggest stand out for me though was the hotel gym. Simply the best I’ve ever seen in a hotel gym… great quality kit, lots of choice and super clean.",5,2023,02,27
141,Excellent hotel,"Exceptional hotel, made to feel very welcome upon arrival, room upgrade which was unexpected, the guest only area is an excellent concept with complimentary coffee and pastries. Even upon check out receptionist remembered we had been celebrating a birthday and hoped that we had enjoyed our stay. Would certainly recommend and return in the future. ",5,2023,02,27
141,How to feel undervalued,"Good rooms yet we weren’t even allowed to sit down and buy at drink in the downstairs or upstairs bar area without a reservation, ridiculous.The Londoner seems to be a good example of how to make paying guests feel undervalued, I had booked 3 rooms.",3,2023,02,27
141,The Londoner & Inga Stauder are amazing.,"Talk about going above and beyond. The staff, particularly Inga Stauder, we’re amazing. After finding out it was my wife’s birthday, they upgraded us to a suite, and when we walked in there was a birthday cake and a bottle of champagne. They also gave us some free credit to use, and Inga made all the reservations for us. We felt very special.",5,2023,02,26
141,Less expensive than other central hotels with great facilities and location,"Great stay to celebrate my birthday. The hotel were very accommodating with early check in and late check out. Sparkling wine was in my
Room waiting for me. They show you around when you check in as it’s easy to get lost. The spa is nice although on the Friday morning all the beds were reserved which I did not know you had to do so I missed out on using the facilities. I have booked to go back
For 2 nights next weekend for my husband’s birthday.

One minor thing is I had late check out yet at 11am and 11.30am house keeping did enter the room. They knocked whilst opening the door so I didn’t have a chance to answer but thankfully I wasn’t getting changed. The key also stopped working. The hotel apologised and not a big enough deal that it would stop be giving the hotel 5 stars. ",5,2023,02,26
141,I LOVE THIS HOTEL,"This was a solo birthday trip for me and the hotel more than delivered with regards to comfort, service, and overall atmosphere.  

Check in was smooth and efficient.  I was given a junior corner suite with a view to the northeast; a bottle of Gusbourne Brut arrived shortly after check-in along with a nice card.  I had previously booked a nail appointment to deal with my poorly neglected talons; the technician provided a lovely ginger tea to sip on while she expertly revived my hands (the polish still looks excellent 10 days later!).

The Residence was such a relaxing and peaceful place to tuck into when the public sections of the hotel were packed with people exploring the area or stopping by after work.  The cocktails were delicious and on point; service was excellent.

I had dinner on my first night at the izakaya bar ""8 at the Londoner"" as I was beginning to feel the jet lag, having arrived at 6 AM at LHR.  The food, truffle beef tataki and lobster gyoza tacos, were expertly seasoned; cocktails were yummy as well.  The staff at the bar kept me very entertained.

This was my second time staying at The Londoner; my first stay was only for a night and I was in the throes of final recovery from Covid.  Nevertheless, my stay was quite good and it prompted me to book again for my birthday.  

I am already trying to figure out logistics for another trip over and I cannot wait to return to The Londoner!",5,2023,02,26
141,Memorable Birthday,"Last weekend I stayed with friends for a girls-only celebration of my birthday. It was one of the best and most memorable experiences we have had!

The hotel was busy but vibrant with live music in the evening. The arrival was flawless and the receptionist was really friendly and showed us the facilities. We initially planned to go out for a drink, but we loved the amazing view at the rooftop bar and stayed there instead! 
This is one of the coolest bars in London for me! The guest-only bar on the 1st floor was much less busy and a must-visit too. It was nice to relax there with some food while listening to the live music from downstairs.

All in all, it was a very memorable experience and we would love to return in the near future!",5,2023,02,22
141,Fantastic stay from A to Z,"Brand new hotel with a ton of facilities. Literally did not leave the hotel during our stay as it has so much to offer. Where to start? Fantastic room (booked interconnecting as we were travelling with children), everything feels super lux and new. Team really paid attention to a couple of requests we have made ahead of arrival, they went out of their way to deliver, which was greatly appreciated as it was a special occasion for us. Other highlights to point out the SPA facilities, the Resident's lounge and dinner service. Literally could not fault a thing, this is the place to be in London. I would however say it is more a couple's hotel than it is a family hotel, but that is not a bad thing.",5,2023,02,21
141,One of the best hotels I’ve visited,"From the minute we stepped through the door into the foyer we were looked after, till the moment we left.

Visited with friends, our suite was beautiful, with a speedy check in, welcome drinks in the room, attentive staff and generally very chilled and relaxed vibe. The barman at The Residence went to the extra effort to make us custom cocktails, accompanied with complimentary chocolates for my friend (her birthday) – I didn’t get his name, but this was a lovely touch!

Next morning at the spa we were offered a glass of water each on arrival, which was automatically topped up when we went for a swim. We also ordered room service in advance and when we returned from our morning swim, the food was again ready and waiting.

Attention to detail was second to none. Made the whole trip extra special and memorable.

Thanks!",5,2023,02,20
141,Friends trip,"Stunning rooms (we were put into a gorgeous suite) and facilities available. For a more chill vibe, we went to The Residence bar and had custom cocktails made!

The service is fast and always on point - we barely stepped into the spa before we were served ice cold water (very welcome for sauna times)!",5,2023,02,20
141,"Fab central hotel, but has difficulties when full.","The hotel is very well located, literally on Leicester Square and walking distance to everywhere central. The room was very nice and clean. The staff was very friendly and attentive. The breakfast was plentiful and the service fast. The Retreat spa was fabulous.
Negatives - the hotel was apparently full and the check-in suffered a lot. The rooms were not ready, there were masses of people waiting for their rooms. I have to give credit to the check-in staff for staying calm and friendly. However, I had to wait 2 hours for my room (arrived at 4pm and got the key at 6pm) - if they would have told me form the beginning it's going to take that long, I would've left my luggage and done something else than sit around and wait. But as it was ""half an hour"", ""15 minutes"", ""2 minutes"", ""15 minutes""... I waited and waited. 
Waiting seems to be a thing in this hotel - I also waited unproportionally long to give my bags for storing, I waited in the Reisdence for food which never arrived, I waited at breakfast for pancakes, which only arrived after second reminder, I waited for half an hour for vase for my flowers...
I'm still giving a positive review, as I think the personnel deserves credit for staying calm and friendly with this overwhelming mass of people.",4,2023,02,20
141,Awesome,"What can I say?! Absolutely magnificent 
One of the best hotel I ever been
Started with very good selection of breakfast, thank you Cat & Gabor to finish with lovely cocktails at The 8 grazie Davide
Definitely see you soon!!!",5,2023,02,18
141,Fantastic Hotel,"We recently stayed at The Londoner Hotel and was thoroughly impressed with our experience. From the moment we walked through the doors, we were greeted by friendly staff who were eager to make my stay as comfortable as possible. 

The Hotel is in a really fantastic central location for shows, sightseeing and shopping.  Very welcoming from all the team there from the time we arrived.

Many thanks to Bernie (Concierge) for booking us a restaurant with only a few hours notice.

The bed was incredibly comfortable, (too far to try to bring the duvet home with me)  and we appreciated the complimentary bottled water and coffee maker (took me a few minutes to find the coffee pods)

The bathroom was also very clean and well-stocked with toiletries. 

The hotel's restaurant, which offered a delicious breakfast menu with a range of options to suit all tastes. The quality of the food was exceptional, and the service was impeccable. 

We are sorry we didn't try the Spa (no forward planning on our behalf).

Many thanks for the  We will definitely be going back..",5,2023,02,17
141,Great spa treatments ,"Great location and vibes. The bed and pillows are so comfortable. Nice selection of complimentary drinks 

The Spa treatments were fantastic (15.2.23 3pm) Special mention to Nikkie (Agency masseuse) and Towela - great service ",4,2023,02,15
141,Brilliant Luxury Modern Hotel,"I understand the hype! This hotel is beautifully designed, the mirrors in the room make the room feel larger than what it is which was great. The bathroom mirror had lovely lighting, the robes and slippers were extremely fluffy and not cheap like other London hotels.

I ordered room service, and the pasta arribata was lovely and arrived in a timely manner, I will 100% stay at this hotel again and have recommended to multiple friends who have also enjoyed their stay. Great for a staycation in London

The Receptionists have a great uniform too! ",5,2023,02,15
141,Special  treat,Very welcoming  from all team from door man reception.breakfast. room service. Big thanks to Pedro reception. Paula room service.  Catalina  Ripon Tchomba from breakfast.

141,4th visit disappointed,"I am writing this very long review with some trepidation but I hope that by writing it some lessons may be learnt.. 
I will start the review with our first visit to the hotel, this was their opening week hence why I revisited as there was bound to be teething problems but in reflection and with our recent stay it was actually pretty bad, my husband and I had ordered room service and was told there would be a delay which was fine so we were relaxing on the bed (not all together dressed) and I decided to take a bath, when I got out of the bath I noticed the room service tray on the table beside my still sleeping naked husband , now I was in the bath with the door open and he is not a sound sleeper and he insisted the door had not knocked I certainly didn’t hear it, very embarrassing. I called down to reception and the manager at the time was very apologetic and did his utmost to reassure us that it was an over sight and policies with regarding not answer the door would be looked into and gave us the usual free drinks etc, whilst embarrassing, again we gave them the benefit of the doubt as it was their opening week.. 2 more stays later one great and although one being my birthday which they were aware of and not noted in any way even a bottle or a birthday plate in my room when even lesser hotels we have stayed at have done, we get to this stay, we frequent London about every other month and tend to mix up the stays between higher end hotels depending on what we are doing, and as we love Whitcombs restaurant we decided to stay here, I booked the hotel over the phone stating we were coming for valentines and that I would like a room on a higher floor with a bath, I received an online check in request via email on the morning of arrival by which you could choose the room via a map which you wanted so I did, a room on the 6th floor which was confirmed, upon arrival at the hotel on check in we were given a room on the 1st floor with no bath, when I said this was not what I had booked I was told that that was the room that was ready I got there at 2.40 but I said I was happy to wait until a room that I had requested was ready, I had a treatment booked for 4pm and was concerned I may be late, so sat and had a drink in the lounge area whilst we were waiting, my daughter and son joined us for these and on receipt of the bill I requested to charge it to my room telling the incredibly rude member of staff of the room situation and that if they could re charge it to the correct room when I had a new room number was told “no you’ll have to pay it now I’m not doing that”
This was witnessed by my whole family and I could not believe she was so rude!! 
I paid the bill left my husband sat in the lounge whilst asking at the reception desk several times if a new room was ready as I needed to change for my treatment, finally a room was ready… no bath 
I went down for my treatment in an upset state as I was now several minutes late, but I have to say a big shout out to the spa staff and my therapist who were fantastic!! 
Treatment finished I booked a cabana for the following day for 3pm went upstairs to find my husband had moved the room to one with a bath and all was good (although no apology)",3,2023,02,13
141,Fantastic stay! ,Excellent staff and lovely details in the room for the the turndown service. We stayed on a Sunday and the spa/pool was quiet and allowed us to properly relax. Would 100% book again and recommend to others. ,5,2023,02,12
141,Delightful,"Stayed here last year and had such a lovely weekend. The hotel is in a perfect location for shops, shows and bars. Popped in today for drinks before a show and enjoyed fantastic cocktails. Staff were all extremely helpful and friendly. Great atmosphere. Singer added to the overall experience. Will definitely return.",5,2023,02,11
141,Superb,And outstanding stay at The Londoner. The whole experience from check-in through to our meal at Whitcomb's was exceptional. The only downside was having to leave! We're looking forward to returning and I've a feeling it won't be too long.,5,2023,02,06
141,Impressive hotel with great location. ,"High quality throughout.

Check in through the app was easy and impressive. Selecting your room was a nice touch - we chose a high floor and even the view. And knowing the room was available - even at 10am meant we could go straight to our room much earlier than usual check in. 

Nice room, which is a little compact. But well appointed. 
Nice bathroom.

Definitely use the pool.  Quiet and very relaxed. Huge day beds and cabanas all free to book and use. Pool warm and a good size. 

Whitcomb’s restaurant was fantastic, loved the food and service. ",5,2023,02,05
141,"Excellent location, service and food.","Excellent hotel in terms of location (right in centre of town), service, and food and beverages. Whilst I haven't stayed overnight, I have stopped by for bar food and drink and every time excellent, no hesitation to recomment",5,2023,01,29
141,Excellent service with attentive staff.,My daughter and I popped in for cocktails on a very cold day. We were met at the door and shown to the bar. Wide choice of drinks. Excellent service. Nice ambience. Made to feel very welcome. Very central location. Very welcoming staff. Will certainly go again.,5,2023,01,28
141,"The finest, most beautiful & luxurious hotel in London ","What an incredible hotel. 
Our stay may have been short but enough to already be planning our next stay here.
The hotel is beautiful, new, modern, arty, clean and just everything you’d want & more.
I feel proud as someone who works in London, that we have this hotel to greet people from all over the world. 
The food was delicious too. We had a meal out in nearby China Town as we were craving Chinese but the top floor has a sensational Japanese restaurant with a great view over the city and a cute garden with a fire pit. 
We drank gin & tonics in the Tavern below the ground floor and listened to live music - you can choose from 50 different Gins. 
Amazing & the staff were so lovely. They recommended different options to me when I couldn’t decide! The raspberry gin was sensational.
Breakfast was delicious and even though I chose only to have fruit & a green smoothie, I could see the cooked options from other guests looked delicious.
Again the service & staff were always on hand & attentive.
The spa - wow ! Well it was a delight to relax in. Our water was constantly topped up by the pool as we chilled in the cosy cabana’s and out soft fluffy dressing gown & slippers were of the highest quality all helping us to feel like special guests.
All the staff for our stay were lovely and one in particular was Rohan who first greeted us on arrival and showed us to a comfy seat to checj us in. He and his colleague whose name I was unable to ask were so lovely to me and my Daughter. 
Rohan continued to provide us with a friendly smile and an impeccable service the whole time. He gave us a tour of the hotel, advice on where to go, hr helped us with everything we needed. What an incredible asset to the hotel he is.  
When we return again we hope to be greeted by Rohan and his team. Even the manager who helped us with our room key when we overstayed our checkout time (because we fell asleep in the cosy spa) was so kind and helpful. 
You have to stay here if you are looking for a hotel right in the heartbeat of London’s theatre land and you want luxury, comfort, great food and first class service.
I literally can’t wait to be back again & again. It’s our new London favourite.

141,50th Birthday - The Londoner,"I've been meaning to do this since we got back from our wonderful stay at the Londoner. My partner had arranged a few days in London for my 50th Birthday as a surprise, our stay was from 10th Jan through to the 12th. We were met at reception by a lovely, friendly young lady called Debra, who explained the facilities of the hotel and offered any assistance during our stay and even arranged a bottle of bubbly and a card in our room when we said its was my 50th birthday. We had a gorgeous room on the 8th floor but not such a lovely view (office buildings)  During our stay all the staff were friendly, helpful and although you know this is how they are trained to be it felt natural and that nothing was too much trouble. We used the pool/steam room on the day of my birthday which was very relaxing and enjoyable and again the lady on duty ( Wednesday morning) was friendly and welcoming and even gave me a glass of bubbly. We visited the roof top Japanese bar on the Tuesday evening, the outside part was closed due to bad weather, but we had amazing views over London and enjoyed our visit there, again welcoming and friendly staff. We didn't eat at the hotel other than breakfast which was really good, best coffee!! 
A great location for China Town, Covent Gardena and Theatres. I didn't want to leave and hope to be back again, thanks again to Debra at reception.",5,2023,01,27
141,Wow!,"What can you say about The Londoner...it’s luxury personified! Glamorous and extravagant, with extraordinary attention to detail in the decor department. If you’re looking for an ‘experience’ in London then this hotel hits the mark. 

The location is perfect for a theatre trip to Covent Garden...right in the heart of Leicester Square. We will be back!",5,2023,01,23
141,A wonderful modern hotel in the middle of Leicester Sq,"We stayed a few weeks ago at the Londoner and we were very happy with our stay. Fantastic service from all staff. A special thank you to Mr Emiel from the concierge team, without you the hotel can not operate. You are a great professional and very passionate about your job! I am sure that the future is bright for you. Keep up the good work. We will be back.",5,2023,01,23
141,Superb!,"As a family of 5 we were looking for a hotel close to the heart of London.  We found it! Not only perfectly positioned but facilities and service were superb! From the seamless check in to great service from Concierge for all our needs, we couldn't fault the place. We got tickets to an EPL game at a reasonable price through Concierge - magicians!",5,2023,01,16
141,"Conceptionally Brilliant, But Not Ready for Prime Time","I found this new ‘super boutique’ hotel called the Londoner on the AMEX Fine Hotels and Resorts site; it looked conceptionally brilliant! After checking their website and reading a few reviews, we thought we would check it out. The Londoner has a great Location, a cool vibe, and some very unique aspects for a hotel. The Londoner is still new, only opening in September 2021 and is one of London’s newest 5 Star hotels but it’s not ready for ‘prime time’ yet.

Location, Location, Location

The Londoner has a great location right on Leicester Square in front of the Christmas Market in the heart of the Theatre District. It is an easy walk to Green Park, Bond Street for shopping, Mayfair & SoHo for great restaurants, Coventry Gardens with their massive Christmas tree and not far from Knightsbridge where Harrods and Harvey Nichols are a must for any trip to London. While a bit of a hike, the Spitalfields Food, Arts Music Market in East London with nearby Vintage shops is well worth the hour walk. If you are not into walking, the Tube stop is steps away. Of course, the black London cabs circle the area. 

Cool Vibe

Walking into the sprawling bronze and dusky pink lobby the Check In is discreetly to the left when you enter the hotel. While absorbing the aesthetics, your bags are whisked away and delivered to your room.

With the AMEX Fine Hotels & Resorts reservation, a room upgrade is included, if available. The front desk staff should be trained better than to say “I can see that there are some rooms available but I need to check with the Manager”. Then after disappearing for 5 minutes he returned to say, “sorry it is not possible to upgrade you right now as the hotel is full, however as you are staying 7 nights with us, as soon as an upgrade becomes available, we will let you know” Hmmmm – you just said you can see some rooms are available…We never heard a word back from the Front Desk.
The Guest Rooms

The guest rooms at The Londoner have been designed by celebrated New York and Toronto-based design agency Yabu Pushelberg and offer a sense of contemporary luxury with a soothing color palette. The Deluxe King Rooms are 29 sq meters with floor-to-ceiling windows, bespoke furniture and original artworks by Ed Pearman and The Connor Brothers.

There’s a king-size bed with a handcrafted Vispring mattress dressed in luxurious Irish linens and feather down pillows. In the ensuite bathroom, you’ll find a vanity sink with an illuminated theatre mirror, rain shower, a Japanese Toto toilet (this is one of the coolest features of the room … of the hotel as they are even in the Residence washrooms) luxury bathrobes and slippers as well as Miller Harris bathroom amenities. What’s more, there’s a Roberts Bluetooth radio with speakers, a fully stocked minibar with blended cocktails by Avantgarde, a Samsung Smart TV, Nespresso coffee machine (no issue to call Housekeeping to bring a dozen coffee pods for those who love coffee and/or are jet lagged) and a selection of tea from the East India Company, free Wifi, Lutron lighting system, Dyson hairdryer, handheld steamer and bottled Nordaq water.
The first downside to the Room was the very limited storage space. The clothes closet was very small and there was no dresser. This was exasperated by it being winter so the suitcases we packed full were full of bulky warm clothes. So, we needed to be extremely creative in our unpacking. It’s a hotel designed for 2 – 3 day stays, not a couple for a week in the winter.

The second downside to the Room was the Housekeeping. When we arrived, we found a pair of women’s underwear on the floor beside the bed. Also, light fixtures work better when they have bulbs in them. One day we returned at 5pm and the room still had not been cleaned. These are definitely things that with better training and more staff can be easily fixed.

A Unique & Brilliant Extension to the Rooms: The Residence

Probably the clincher for us to book the Londoner is that its Guests have access to three exclusive Residence spaces within the Hotel. There is the Y Bar, the Drawing Bar and the Whisky Bar. As The Stage Bar in the Lobby is normally very busy, these private escapes for residents of the hotel are treasured. Complimentary antipasti, soft drinks, tea and coffee are served throughout the day and evening, as well as a complimentary breakfast selection of freshly baked patisseries, yoghurts, fresh fruit and artisan cheese between 9am and 12pm. Full bar service and a dining menu are also available which is great when Whitcombs is packed at Breakfast or you just prefer a little privacy and peace and quiet. There is also a library of handcrafted Assouline books, classic boardgames and the latest newspapers and fashion magazines to enjoy.

Conceptionally brilliant, but to execute The Residence well requires more staff. The complimentary antipasti table offering was thin and was not regularly restocked. Service was exceptionally slow to the point we just left. Again, not difficult fixes.

Restaurants

The Londoner has an impressive array of Restaurants; something for everyone: Elegant French Mediterranean cuisine, Japanese rooftop bar, Neighborhood tavern, and Champagne indulgence.

Whitcomb’s: Is an elegant French Mediterranean. Presenting simple yet elegant cuisine prepared using carefully selected quality ingredients, The Londoner’s fine dining restaurant captures a sense of tradition and modernity with a terrace overlooking Leicester Square. Breakfast is also served here. There is a fairly standard buffet enabling you to create your own traditional English Breakfast: scrambled eggs (but if you want any other type of eggs, just ask), bacon, back bacon, sausages, baked beans, mushrooms, tomatoes. There is also cheese, prosciutto, breads, pastries and a selection of jams. There is a freshly squeezed juice bar, yogurts, fresh fruit and bowls of granola, seeds & nuts. There is also a full menu with most items included except Grilled steak and Alaskan crab for an additional fee.
The only downside was the staffing. Service was often very slow and inconsistent: you often had to wait for a table to be cleaned and wait for your coffee to come. Again an easy fix.
In Summary

The Londoner, the World’s First Super Boutique Hotel is conceptionally brilliant, but the execution is far from what I would expect given its cost and 5 star rating. It requires more training of the staff is has and more staff; this would improve the service level dramatically taking the execution to its conceptional brilliance; dressers in the rooms would take it over the top!

The Londoner’s great Location, cool vibe, and some very unique aspects for a hotel, especially The Residence’s three exclusive spaces within the Hotel: the Y Bar, the Drawing Bar and the Whisky Bar combine to create an exceptional ‘super boutique’ hotel in London . London isn’t short of remarkable hotels, but the Londoner truly is an experience, setting it apart. Artfully designed at every turn, the property is inspiring to say the least, and is one of the trendiest locations to see and be seen at in the city today. Given how great the property could be and the location, we might give The Londoner another chance on our next pre-Christmas trip to London.",3,2023,01,10
141,"Great Hotel , Amazing Experience","We stayed for 3 nights over New year Eve at the Londoner hotel. We arrived to the hotel at 11 am and were greeted by Debora with coffees and her beautiful smile. Our room was ready for us and we were able to check in ! Debora was very friendly and helpful any requests that we had ( Book for a massage , Activities , coffee etc.) 
As for the room we booked a room with a city view. Our room had a splendid view of the Christmas market ( Leicester Square). 
beside the unbeatable view and the location. 
House keeping was always good about keeping our room cleaned. 
We had breakfast at the Whitcomb's only one time. It was a buffet and you could order more food from the Menu. 
One of the Hightlights for us was the Spa. Staff was very Attentive and everything was so perfect ! ",5,2023,01,04
141,Christmas Stay,"We stayed in June and had a great experience so was excited to come back at Christmas. Unfortunately it was a very different experience. The check in process was messy as people were trying to check in from both sides which caused confusion (and frustration) over whom should be checked in first. We were told our room had been upgraded, but it was actually very small. And the shower fixture needed repair so couldn't use the shower properly that evening. I decided not to complain but things didn't really improve. The food and beverage we had was okay but not to the standard of our previous visit. The staff in Whitcomb's were somewhat disorganized which meant I had to get silverware and cups for our table. On the evening we were disappointed to find that the rooftop 8 was closed (especially with it being Christmas) and the Stage bar closed at 11pm even though it was busy and we wanted to enjoy some of the festive season in our hotel. Then when checking out we were given a bill which was completely unexpected and could have been avoided had the staff explained clearly the situation upon our arrival. When I was asked about our stay and I said it was very disappointing the response was 'sorry to hear that' and nothing else discussed. Needless to say it has left a bad taste when the expectation for this type of hotel is exemplary customer service and the ability to provide solutions to problems, neither of which happened. When you consider the cost to stay at this hotel and the other options that are available its very unlikely we will be back.",2,2023,01,03
141,Do not stay at this hotel,I have never written a review of anything but my experience at this hotel was so terrible I felt obligated to do so. This is not a 4/5 star hotel. Unprofessional poorly trained staff. Concierge non responsive to requests for help. Lobby lounge jammed with non-guests on their phones waiting for theatre shows or sheltering from rain. Residence area for ‘guests only’ is difficult to access and serves minimal  food on a cart that looks like it’s been there for days. Will never stay at or recommend this hotel. Check bill carefully - was overcharged by 1k. Got it fixed but no apology or sense of wrongdoing by staff. ,1,2023,01,02
141,In Leicester Square,"The boutique hotel is conveniently located in Leisceter Square, close to Civent Garden, Soho, Piccadilly, Regent Street, and River Thames.

Beautiful property looks luxurious from the outside and once you step inside compared to the scene in the square outside. Smells good too!  Once you enter the lobby area will turn into a jazz live music club on some nights with people dressed formally which is  a beautiful touch to what we’re used to see in any hotel. 

The service is a bit slow probably because it’s always so busy. I had to wait two hours for my room and once I got it I was disappointed even though I got a deluxe, it seemed like a lesser category! No wardrobe space at all! Had to leave all my clothing in the luggage and just hand one item in the right wardrobe. So when you book ask for a room with more wardrobe space. Also one cannot open the blinds and do stuff in the room without feeling like everyone outside can see clearly everything going on inside the room. It’s because the room had a “city view” overlooking Leicester Square, so if you prefer privacy it would be better not getting a room with that extra feature. Otherwise the rooms are really stylish,",4,2022,12,28
141,Excellent stay and service,"Wonderful short break just ahead of Christmas Eve. Magnificent brand new property with stunning views and so many amenities to choose from. We particularly enjoyed the spa, the on site pub and Whitcombes. The service was incredible, very attentive and genuine. Will be back!",5,2022,12,26
141,Stay in the Londoner Hotel London,"The hotel was in a prime location
 The staff were lovely
 Varied breakfast 
The concierge was very helpful, booked us places and directed us every morning to what we asked for. 
Bell Boy immediately got a taxi 
Clean and tidy room servic, quite,  
The room is a bit small and there is not much closet space for 2 people so it is a bit crowded. 
Refrigerator - if you find something in it, you pay, so ask to take their things out of the refrigerator and put yours in.
 Apart from the closet in the room, all the accommodation in the hotel was excellent, we will return 
Thanks.",5,2022,12,26
141,Amazing !,"The hotel is gorgeous. The atmosphere is so welcoming with a beautiful scent throughout the lobby and the bar. Deborah was incredibly accommodating and friendly. She took us into the bar to chat around a cup of pepper mint tea- 
After a long flight from New York it was great to be warmly greeted by Deborah and to learn a little bit about this new hotel. The breakfast was amazing and although the room was on the small side, the blue and modern bathroom was wonderful ( We loved the toto toilets )-
This was a very welcome respite from all the walking we were doing every day ( not to mention the cold and rain ). Also the hotel was central to every place. 
Located in Leicester Square with the Christmas market just in front of the hotel. 
We wanted to visit and a short hop to the tube if we needed to go further.",5,2022,12,20
141,Miss,"Our stay was absolutely amazing, the service was second to none. All the staff were extremely polite and super friendly. I especially want to thank Debrah for being so accommodating and helpful during our stay.",5,2022,12,18
141,Exceptional afternoon tea.,"Afternoon tea at The Londoner is simply wonderful. The staff are exceptional and the ambiance excellent. A piano player/singer adds to the experience. 
The tea itself was superb. Beautifully presented and served. Each course explained and advised upon. Nothing was too much trouble and above all, we were not rushed, nor felt we had overstayed.
A massive choice of teas, the flavours excellent. The food was an amalgamation of flavours, we did not find fault with any part of it. 
This is an exceptional, affordable afternoon tea in the centre of London. 
Highly recommended and a big thank you to the staff for making my daughters birthday treat so memorable.",5,2022,12,17
141,Great hotel with some room for improvement,"So far, our experience has been very good. We were promptly and warmly welcomed to the hotel by Debora—she took us up to our room, showed us around, and told us about some of the great perks of the property.

Our room was probably more suited for a single traveler or someone here on business—there was hardly any space to put two suit cases for two people on a 10-day trip, let alone, put them away.

That said, Marvin, who has been equally amazing, understood our situation and was able to get us to into another room that was much more suitable for our situation.

We had a pleasant experience at The Residence—the drinks were delicious. Our favorite, so far, has been the rooftop bar, called 8 at The Londoner. The DJ was playing some of the best music I think I’ve heard, and it set just the right vibe that went along with perhaps some of the best drinks and food I’ve tasted at a hotel. If you can, try the Lobster Tempura. And, the Lychee Rosé—I won’t do it justice trying to describe how good it is.

The hotel could use another entrance off the side or at least allow guests to come in through there to get to the check-in area, as it was uncomfortable and inconvenient having to carry our heavy luggage up a hill and through a very crowded square.

All in all, we’ve had a very good experience. There are, however, some adjustments the hotel could make to truly live up to its “super boutique” classification. We’d absolutely visit again, and would recommend it to others.",4,2022,12,17
141,Amazing hotel best location in London the staff extremely kind and attentive we had a king city view room very nice,"Amazing hotel with best location in London 
We had a king city view room on the 7 floor with a nice view of Leicester Square 
The room is modern and beautifully decorated best fresh towels 
The staff from the reception true the room service and the doorman extremely kind and attentive 
For sure one of the best hotels in London",5,2022,12,17
141,Beautiful but cleanliness is an issue,"The hotel was lovely but for over $1k a night there were some serious cleanliness flaws. The check in was incredibly smooth and they were able to accommodate us early which was nice. The first room we went into was covered in dead flies. I’m not talking one or two. About 30. When I went down to the desk to complain they just offered to move us into another room. Our second room, no joke had the same amount of flies. When I brought the concierge in to see it they were going to move us to another room of the same category when I lost it. For $1200 a night that is obscene. And to not offer any type of compensation or upgrade?! I finally had to complain and they gave us a suite which is ridiculous. Besides the flies the room and the hotel were quite lovey. Breakfast was a bit disorganized but the selection was nice. Had it not been for the state of the original rooms it would have been a wonderful stay.",3,2022,12,16
141,Not 5 star. Gone seriously downhill since our first visit in July,"Partner and I stayed in July and we’re blown away with how incredible it was. Service, just everything they went above and beyond for us so of course we were so excited to return. We returned for 2 nights first week of December and had a totally different experience. I had gone out of my way to contact the reception weeks before to make a point about us celebrating my partners birthday. I wanted to pay extra for some balloons, I arranged it all but on the day of arrival there were no balloons in the room. When I questioned reception they literally told me there had been a miscommunication, and that was it. They eventually did put the balloons in the room but honestly it was just crap that It hadn’t been done as I requested, they were put in the room at 7pm and had all fallen down by 10pm. I couldn’t believe it. Go to the Corinthia or the Dorchester and you’d NEVER experience such rubbish service. With no real apology too. Honestly it wasn’t 5*. Breakfast was super busy, had to literally ask 3 or 4 times for anything extra I gave up asking for more tea because after 15 minutes what’s the point. Was not blown away at all this time round. Only thing worth noting was the spa, the LOVELY ladies at Ama nails did us both a beautiful pedicure and I couldn’t recommend them enough. But not enough to go back, certainly not for a special occasion anyway! Oh and it’s super noisy too. I know the area is a busy part of London but don’t stay here if you want peace at night. Protests kept us up most of the night.",3,2022,12,15
141,Great service and hotel,"We stayed here for one night and found the hotel great.  Staff were really attentive and helpful. Room was great, Japanese toilets were a nice touch.
The main bar had a great atmosphere in the evening, had a couple of drinks in here after the theatre.
The pool & steam room were really nice to use in the morning.
Great location in Leicester Square, we would stay here again.",4,2022,12,14
141,Very disappointing.,"On the first stay this was for my partners birthday in which the hotel went above and beyond.
The second stay for my own birthday in which I have to say was not great, booked through American express both times the hotel was unable to upgrade the second time due to lack of space at the hotel this was disappointing as using the American express card to book hotel on many occasions this is one of the big benefits you get used to, especially when booking for a special occasion.
My partner had arranged for the room to have birthday balloons in the room when we arrived with the hotel. When getting to the room to her disappointment these had not been arranged by the hotel.
The room was dirty is some areas where dust had built up on ledges but clearly not cleaned.
The room we booked was with a city view ill have to admit looking at a crane being the only real view from our room was very disappointing.
Breakfast..... Now we went down to have breakfast around 8am the first day. service was very slow but also the seating area is very close together no room whatsoever to relax and enjoy your food. The air conditioning was on so high the food on your plate would be cold within minutes.
My partner twice asked for another tea but this did not arrive to which we then left, the stay seems over run but it was not to busy at all to myself it seems they had no real structure on who does what like plate clearing and additional cutlery if you wanted fruit after, it was easier to get this of the table next to us.
On leaving the hotel we wanted to have a quick bite to eat before gong home, we went to sit in around the bar seating area but the staff member was quick to say this is reserved in which I replied this seat has no sign he said are you staying at the hotel in which I replied yes. In this case he said you can use the lunge room up on floor one, NO ONE had even told us this exists.....
Overall this is not what I would expect from a 5 star hotel in London and even though the first visit really was great I shall not be returning again as other hotels offer an excellent service every time.",2,2022,12,14
141,Busy!,"From the outside, we were under the impression the hotel would be a calm, tranquil place to stay.  How wrong were we!  On entering the reception area, it was packed full of people.  I don’t know if it’s always like this or if it’s because of the lead up to Christmas. 

The reception area is quite awkward as it’s not that big and you’re never sure where to queue.  We were seen quite quickly though and the staff were very professional.  

Our room wasn’t ready (which I expected) so we left our luggage and I they sent a text advising our room number.  They also put our luggage in the room for our return.

We tried to get a drink at the bar before we went to see a show but it was full so we went to the rooftop bar.  This was lovely but very expensive! 

The rooms are quite small and the bathroom was open plan.  I’m not a fan of open plan bathrooms as I like a bit of privacy.  The toilet was a bit more private.   I found the bed too hard but my husband liked it.  

Overall, the hotel is in a great location for theatres and shops etc but next time we go to London, we will chose a quieter hotel.",4,2022,12,12
141,Best Hotel in London…Maybe the World ,"The best hotel in London!! We had the best experience. This hotel offers it all: location, beautifully appointed rooms, incredible food and beverage and amazing service. Where can you find a hotel in London that is steps from all of the major attractions, built in 2021, with a pool and spa and offering over five different restaurant experiences. This is where you want to stay in London. Kudos to Emilian at the front desk for taking great care of us throughout our stay!! He is a rockstar. ",5,2022,12,11
141,Lovely super boutique hotel in great location,"Elegant hotel, excellent location. Rooms were excellent with great attention to detail including a very fancy toilet. Staff are very friendly. The breakfast was very good.

The retreat area for guests was a good benefit and the pool looked lovely.",5,2022,12,07
141,"Great Hotel, Great Location!","Stayed here for business and was amazed not only at the location but the hotel itself. From the moment I walked in the door I was treated very professionally but personally. I didn't have to check in at the reception as is normal, I was greeted by a front desk staff, Deborah, who took me right into the lobby bar where we sat down, chatted, had a cup of coffee, and she checked me in right there. Arriving in the morning from an international flight, I arrived well before the normal check in time and expected to leave my bags and wander the city for a few hours. Not in this case. After checking me in, Deborah handed me my room keys and said my room was ready. I don't know if this is everyday or just the fact they had a room available, but it was nice to be able to go to my room and have a quick rest and refresh. I've stayed in hotels in other parts of the city but never this part of London. The hotel sits right in Leicester Square, in the theatre district. Leicester is having a Christmas celebration so there were a lot of people and noise, but once inside this boutique style hotel, it was quiet. Perfect location! Chinatown a block away, Piccadilly Circus only about two blocks away, Trafalgar right around the corner, the Tube very close by to go anywhere in London. I would DEFINITELY stay here again and look forward to my next trip to London!",5,2022,12,04
141,thorne,"great service, lovely pool and spa, beautiful decor and view from bedroom, very friendly staff, yummy food, location is amazing very central and next to a tube station!! would definitely stay here again!!",5,2022,12,03
141,"Great location, worth the cost","Incredible location. Walking distance from everywhere we needed to get to. Fairly spacious room. Extremely comfortable bed. 
By far the best hotel gym I’ve ever seen. 
Friendly staff and extremely professional. Any request for help answered forthwith.
Expensive, but we definitely got our money’s worth.",5,2022,12,02
141,A Hotel that certainly lives up to its 5* reputation!,"My partner had surprised me with afternoon tea at The Stage Champagne Bar located within the heart of The Londoner Hotel with a setting that is gorgeously grand with a real air of elegance and theatrics. 

We were warmly welcomed upon arrival, where we were taken to our table by our waiter Dario. Dario provided an outstanding service from beginning to end and provided an incredible knowledge of the ''Act II'' menu which provides handcrafted patisserie and delicious sandwiches, all served with fine loose leaf tea from The East India Company and champagne should you wish (which I highly recommend). 

When you did not think you could be spoilt enough, you are entertained by an accompaniment of live music which is a wonderful touch! I would also like to take the time to say a big ''Thank You'' to Claire from The Londoner Hotel team who had arranged a birthday gift and card which was both a surprise to me and my partner and an extremely kind gesture! 

Thank you to everyone at The Londoner who made this a truly memorable experience. We are already making plans to return and cannot recommend The Londoner enough!",5,2022,11,28
141,Perfect location and Spa area,"The location of this hotel is perfect right in the centre of Leicester Square. It was difficult to believe you were in the heart of London when you were in the spa. Staff were courteous and polite. The roof top bar was lovely but advise to book. The room, bed and pillows were very comfortable. The bathroom area very impressive. Other bars were also very good.",5,2022,11,24
141,Beatrice made to stay so special,"I would just like to thank all the staff, especially Beatrice the manager at the hotel.
She was so helpful. Unfortunately myself and my son were due to go on a pre Christmas break to Lapland to visit Santa.
unbeknown to us If your passport runs out 90 days before travelling they will not let you board the flight. 
We were 4 days into the 90 days!!! So were denied access to board even though officially his passport did not run out until February 2023, in an attempt to try and make it up to him, We went straight to the Londoner from Gatwick airport. We have been a number of times for drinks whenever we go to the West End, my son has always asked if he could stay so I thought we could stay there & go to winter wonderland… Not quite Lapland but there you go! Beatrice very kindly gave us a discounted rate on the room and most of all sent up a card and a present from Santa to our room, this was so heartwarming and kind. I can’t thank you enough for helping us and making our stay a little bit more special when we were having such a bad time. THANK YOU 🙏",5,2022,11,24
141,Splendid ! ,"Immaculate hotel with wonderful interior design. Modern and comfortable. The minute we walk in Debora with her beautiful smile made us to feel special. She escorted us into our room and even brought our luggage upstairs ! She was lovely and attentive. We loved the vibe of the stage and the live music. Have eaten at the rooftop and the Whitcomb's - both are fantastic. We absolutely loved this new hotel. Impeccable service. 
Highly recommend. ",5,2022,11,24
141,Nice hotel but service not good!,"We booked The Londoner for our anniversary, I spoke to a lady over live chat to see if they could do anything special for us. She said they would but they didn’t. I then spoke to the front desk to see if they could, was promised they would but never did either! We ordered room service drinks and this took about 30 minutes to be delivered, can’t imagine it was this busy!! Also paid for a “City View” but was just looking over all bar one so wasn’t really a view! The rooms are nice, quite small but look decent. I wouldn’t stay here especially not for a special occasion.",3,2022,11,23
141,Definitely not for families.,"I've thought long and hard about the tone I want to take with this review.  The hotel is fine.  Great location.  Middle of everything.  The beds are nice (Americans- the bed sizes in England, though the same name, are different sizes), the showers were spacious with never ending warm water.  The rooms are small, but that was expected coming in.  The downsides though are what brought this hotel down in my rating.  The check in process is horrible.  Not the actual desk, rather the representations made by staff over the phone and at the hotel.  Don't believe anything they say.  We got in at 9:00am and finally got our rooms at about 4:00.  The Residence is also a bit more than advertised.  Made out to be an oasis it is in reality a hard to access, periodically equipped disappointment.  
There are very good staff and some that seem bothered by your presence.    Stay here if you are a couple looking to make the most of the restaurant and theatre scene.  Tourist families?  Go somewhere else.",3,2022,11,23
141,Average place in central London,"Just stayed there for one night and first impressions were not bad (not great either). Our room was dusty and there was some hair on the sofa (apparently the room was not thoroughly cleaned). Reported it to the receptionist and he immediately offered us a different room, but you wouldn't expect to have to deal with this in a 5* hotel...not in Central London. The quality of the service I'd say was rather mediocre like everything else in this hotel. Having to go to the staff directly on a few occasions to order drinks, some of the staff were friendly and others were grumpy (shortage of staff in the hospitality industry I guess)...I mean, it is not that bad, but it isn't a 5* either.",3,2022,11,21
141,The Londoner stay,"Lovely hotel, room a little small and service not as expected but overall a good stay. Food lovely. Spa gorgeous. Location is perfect for central London. View overlooked Christmas markets. Bathroom very nice with toiletries included. Good break.",4,2022,11,21
141,Amazing ,"It was an amazing experience here ! The room was perfect, comfortable and the crew of the hotel was nice. Thanks to Deborah for her kindness, professionalism, it was nice to talk to someone who remembers about you. I’ll come back ! ",4,2022,11,19
141,Worth it,"Great location no need for taxi to move  around 
Staff are very helpful  kind . Will do their  best  to  serve you and make  sure your request is satisfied 
Room  amazing  experience  nice  design 
Very comfortable bed 
Open window ! 
Easy access 
Most  wonderful hotel in london ever visited",5,2022,11,19
141,Five star service,"From the moment we walked in we experienced five star service. A guided tour around the facilities ending at our exceptional room.
The residence area is superb, staff attending to your needs and complimentary tea/coffee and soft drinks. Lunched there rather than the bustle of the main restaurant and it was perfect. 
Spa area is again five star, book a cabana and lie back and relax - an amazing space.
Only a short stay and so wish we could have stayed longer",5,2022,11,13
141,Overwhelmingly disappointing,"welcome staff were great, however the service stopped there. The Londoner hotel is fur coat with nothing underneath, very poor show.

Residential bar staff didn’t welcome us upon entry, had to find a seat, had to ask for menus, had to get a member of staff to take order (who was blunt and made you feel like your inconveniencing her). Had to go to the bar for a 2nd order (a 3rd to pay). It was not busy so the 4 staff on we’re certainly looking busy.

breakfast- regretfully slow, chaotic, order incorrect and took 25 minutes (pancakes). No service and staff rushed off their feet, so wife and I ate separately given food timings.

Room - was filthy, floor had food on it, everything caped in dust",2,2022,11,12
141,Excellent hotel in all aspects,"This is certainly my preferred hotel in London. Modern, excellent location, stylish and with updated technology, spa, gym and pool. The bars including beautiful Rooftop bar and restaurant as well as breakfast are excellent.",5,2022,11,11
141,Good stay,"A big thank you to Maria who looked after us on arrival. Luggage waiting for us in our room. 
One criticism there isn't a makeup/magnifying mirror in the bathroom area which makes it very difficult if your eyesight isn't good, luckily I could nip out to purchase one. 
Dinner in the restaurant was excellent. 
Used Valet parking it is a shame that there isn't an entrance in Whitcomb Street. It was raining hard and I had to leave the car and run around the corner then queue at the Concierge desk, risking a parking ticket. Once in contact all good",5,2022,11,10
141,very good,"Lovely new Modern Hotel well placed. What We loved about the hotel is that we can feel a very personalized service, the staff took care to bring our Luggages to the room. Thank you very much to Deborah she was so very kind to us, and she provided us an excellent tour of the hotel. The food at the Whitcomb's is Tremendous. Doorman very helpful if you need a taxi. Also loved the live music at the stage. Very chic Hotel we will come back.",5,2022,11,09
141,"Lovely looking Hotel, genuinely friendly staff the  facilities are first rate and the bedrooms are stunning.","A fantastic experience, the Hotel is truly 5 star. From the moment you enter the Hotel the staff truly appear sincere, kind and courteous. The Quality of the facilities are first class. The Bedroom was stunning and the technology excellent",5,2022,11,06
141,The Best Hotel We Have stayed in ! ,"From the moment we arrived we were greeted by smiling friendly staff and a lobby atmosphere that was buzzing yet relaxed . Wonderful artwork ,beautiful furnishings all creating a great first impression . Our room was exactly as described ,very comfortable beds & pillows with a beautiful appointed bathroom . Special mention for the Toto toilets that are amazing ! Never seen a loo like it ! The stage lobby bar was great for informal drinks and the pianist was wonderful . The 8 rooftop bar was gorgeous , brilliant music and the best Moscow mules we’ve had ! Breakfast was incredible , so much choice and the staff were lovely . 
We really cannot fault our stay ,every staff member was attentive and made us feel special and welcomed . 
What a way to spend both our birthdays a weekend we shall remember . Can’t wait to return . Thank you ",5,2022,11,06
141,Wonderful experience!!,"Thank you for an amazing experience!! Beautiful design, friendly and very helpful staff. Got ""wrong"" room first and was no problem to get help and the right room that was pre-booked.  Great help from Debra for sorting out the room-issue and also great help from the doormen to get taxis in the evening. The Concierge help us with suggestions for great restaurants and was very helpful. The hotel have wonderful views and location.  We are coming back! Thank you The Londoner. Keep up the good work!",5,2022,11,06
141,Design is nothing without function,"With all the attention to the nice design, details hotel should not forget about it basic function, which means providing a room where you can regenerate and feel comfortable specifically when it comes to sleeping, unfortunately, the ventilation of the bathroom runs 24/7 so I was obliged to use my earplugs to get some quietness

The service is either understaffed or on qualified to handle even if you guessed during lunch in the restaurant and that breakfast I was asked to use the residence club, which was staffed with one and a half waiter to handle all the wishes and orders of about 25 people. The so-called Buffet was more or less empty. The rules tasted like they have been there for decoration of purposes only. Luckily, you could help yourself with a coffee being served in in a premium porcelain cup without a saucer available.  

Sorry, but I was expecting something different after a chief editor of a respected hotel magazine recommended this place to me !",3,2022,11,04
141,Excellent hotel ,"Honestly the hotel is absolutely Brilliant! Location is obviously very central so great if you're in need of that. 
The hotel itself is very well presented! The décor, the ultimate clean feel of all areas of the hotel, and the very friendly staff has given this hotel a 5* Review.
You certainly get what you pay for! I've stayed in numerous hotels around the world along with hotels in this country including London. I would certainly say this hotel is up there I think with being the best I've stayed in pound for pound. 
I only stayed in a standard room however the room was very spacious, clean and decorated Very well. 

I would recommend this Hotel to everyone who is in a very high standard hotel in this particular area",5,2022,10,30
141,Great new hotel well located.,"This relatively new hotel is well located, nicely decorated with a cool bar, well equipped gym and spa. The service is excellent, Deborah at the front desk was efficient and charming. The rooms are on the small side, but this is London after all. Will return.",5,2022,10,30
141,Excellent Stay & Service!,"I had an excellent stay at the Londoner for the weekend. Location is great, it's very central to a lot of sites and easy to get around. The staff were all very friendly and helpful and I also enjoyed checking out the various restaurants at the hotel. The Stage was probably my favorite and I really enjoyed the live performances. 

My room was very comfortable, my only feedback would be that the bathroom lighting could have been better, it was very dim even when turned on the brightest.",5,2022,10,25
141,Beautiful calm oasis  in the very heart of Leicester Square,"This is a super hotel which prides itself on service it’s also visually stunning. Their attention to detail is superb.
Highly recommend this hotel. We normally stay at the savoy but left it to late to book. We will be returning here not the Savoy.",5,2022,10,25
141,Beautiful Hotel,"This hotel is gorgeous, very new, and well-put-together. Breakfast was very expensive and busy. There is limited space to put suitcases in the rooms but they are gorgeous. The rooftop bar has an amazing view, drinks are again expensive but it is nice for the experience.",4,2022,10,24
141,An extraordinary stay,The restaurants with brilliant food and service as well as the generally good and pleasant treatment. A unique and tastefully decorated property that has created peace and harmony in a wonderful variety. Perfectly placed within walking distance to everything that is extra during a stay in London. But you will stay at the Londoner.,5,2022,10,24
141,Retreat,"Great hotel in a perfect location with great stuff.
Very clean with very good amenities.many options for drinks and food for a city hotel.the atmosphere and the vibes of The Londoner is memorable.i felt more like a retreat than a hotel in london.we found the hotel by luck,as we have been customers of all big brands in london,definatelly it was the best experience tahn all and from now on we will be Londonersssss",5,2022,10,24
141,Mini staycation,"We booked this hotel through Amex fine hotels programme and it didn’t disappoint. We could pick our room in advance and we were upgraded on arrival.  
The hotel was beautifully presented throughout with really fantastic artwork. We particularly loved the little spy hole art works in the lifts. My ten year old was very intrigued and love them. 
Our room was spotless and the bed extremely comfortable. The shower, an all important feature,  was powerful and hot. 
The retreat was superb and we enjoyed swimming in the pool. It was warm and long enough for me to do decent laps. The day beds were private and lush. 
We had a fantastic set lunch in Whitcombs and they were more than happy to accommodate our fussy ten year old. Breakfast was nice and our pancakes excellent. 
You can’t beat the hotel’s central location, especially as it’s a stones throw from the Lego shop! We walked to the Dominion theatre in ten minutes to watch a show and the next day we walked over to the Tate modern in just over half an hour. 
It was a wonderful experience for us both and I wouldn’t hesitate to book again.",5,2022,10,19
141,Not like before,"I said and this hotel earlier this year and I know that it is recently opened however I have noticed as a client that the level of service is not worth the high price due to the fact that there is no respect for the hotel guest. I have written complaint to the house manager about my room & he didnt bother himself by meeting or even giving me a call! the housekeeping is horrible as I always need to follow up with them about cleaning my room or providing me with complimentary water. Also conceirge, I need to chase them for my laundry or packages received. reception is trying their best to get the hotel guest satisfied and special thanks to Ach and Shaheen. however I don't think I would be a returning guest although I am a member of the I prefered hotel but I did not feel that I'm respected or my feedback valued.",5,2022,10,17
141,Splendid,"I stayed here for a business trip as part of a group booking. First impression, located smack bang in the centre of London with quite an unassuming facade. Check-in was quick and friendly. The room was impressive - modern decor, clean and well-presented. I only had breakfast, but the food was good, even if the portions were a little smaller than I would have preferred. Overall, expensive, but worth the indulgence.",5,2022,10,16
141,Not really what we expected ,"We stayed here with my couple for my Bday in May.
The hotel is well located and quite clean.
Some members of the staff were polite but others were  acting a bit pretentious and were not so really customer oriented. In fact we don't find anything special to highlight except the location and the cleanness. ",3,2022,10,09
141,Perfect was a drink out and more I am sure!,Lounge to try! Loved the design theme and cocktails selection. The team was also on point. The music is just amazing! To try…. Always great to discover new place… this one was really a great surprise .. just beautify! Friends birthday .. was great!!,5,2022,10,07
141,Rude Staff,"The staff were not friendly and helpful at all. I won't recommend this hotel to anyone. The only thing I liked about this hotel was its location. Other than that, it was one of my worst experience. Don't wast your money.",1,2022,10,06
141,Nice hotel spoilt by billing issues,"The hotel it’s self is very good. Nicely finished with good rooms - we stayed in a deluxe double. The majority of staff excellent at their job.

I was prompted via email and the app to check in online a couple of days before my stay, entering card details for the room fee which I did.  We then physically l checkin at the hotel ready for our stay. I’ll now skip to check out…
We checked quickly as I was in a rush to get out of London as we were there on London Marathon race day. I had a quick look at the invoice and could see the room fee was on there. I queried this with the receptionist as I’d already entered card details on the online check in and the amount was pending on my bank account who assured me the original fee would not be taken and was a holding charge only. I paid and left.

Sure enough the “holding charge” left my account as did the final bill payment so now I have been charged twice for my room. Four days later, several emails and two phone calls to the hotel and they still have my money and have not actually confirmed it will be returned!

Upon closer inspection of the final invoice the hotel had charged me an ‘optional’ service charge at every bar and restaurant used. This added up to a hearty figure on top of the gratuities I had left already. These optional fees are not stated on any bar or restaurant receipts at the time of signing. Had I have known I’d have more than likely decided to pay them at the point of signing the bill rather than leaving my own gratuity.  I asked for these to be refunded which they have been…a sum of only £70 but they have decided to hold on to my £665 room fee for longer… 
 
Our first port of call was the residents area for breakfast. Service for breakfast was poor. Slow. So slow our breakfast took 1/2 hour. The cold toast came out after we’d finished and our two breakfast cocktails were cancelled as they never showed up, even after chasing for them. The waiter was flustered and rushing around so you could get hold of him.

First impressions were not the best but all other bars and restaurants visited were very good. But the whole experience was spoilt by the billing fiasco that still hasn’t been solved.",2,2022,10,06
141,Amazing!,"I stayed here back in March for a pre birthday celebration with my partner and friends.
As soon as we walked through the door the service was exceptional. 
Drinks was served for us whilst checking in and Aly made us feel so welcome. 
We stayed in a deluxe King room and we was upgraded to a city view. 
Our luggage was taken to the room whilst checking in and Aly gave us a room and hotel tour. 
Rooms were quite big for London standards with separate toto toilet and bath and shower. Beds were  extremely comfy. 
The residence rooms were amazing, such a nice touch for guests and drinks and snacks are complimentary.  We didn’t use the spa as we had arrangements. 
Every time we went back to hotel we was always greeted with a hello and smiles. Even the door men were friendly. 
Location right in the middle of Leicester Square, yes some guests say that they have to lug there own luggage but the main road is only 50m away.
When we left and wanted a taxi to the train station one of the door man ran out to the main road to help us flag one down and when he found one he ran back to the hotel to inform us and even walked with us to the Taxi and helped with our luggage. 
We loved our stay here and found the service to us was exceptional and it was the next level up. 
I’ve stayed in Many hotels around the world and found The Londoner to have one of the best service I have encountered, each time walking back inside we was always greeted and asked how our day was.  
Also I was given a complimentary bottle of wine as a birthday Treat. 
Just want to say we all had a lovely time staying in The Londoner and definitely our No 1 choice in London.",5,2022,10,04
141,Just Fantastic,Location. Staff. Service. Attitude. Facilities. All 5/5. Will definitely return. Fantastic value. You could pay 2x or 3x and not get this. Particularly loved Maria’s checkin and looking after us. She made sure everything was sorted and really welcomed us to the hotel.,5,2022,10,03
141,Beautiful Hotel With 1 Issue,"Stayed at The Londoner Hotel for 4 nights recently. Overall, loved the hotel and would recommend it for travelers looking for a luxury hotel in the center of London

The Good
- Location is great if you're looking to be next to the main London sights. Located right in Leicester Square, The Londoner is walking distance to many tourist attractions in London.
- Hotel is new and is very ""scene-y""
- Amenities (The Residence Lounge, gym, etc.) are awesome. At The Residence Lounge you can get complimentary tea and small snacks in a comfortable hang-out area.
- Reception staff was amazing (shout out to Gaia)

The Not Good
- Only issue I had was at midnight a room service employee knocked on my door while sleeping with food. When I informed him I didn't order anything, he started arguing with me that I did and refused to take no for an answer. Eventually he checked his room number and realized he knocked on the wrong door. I wanted to give The Londoner a 5 star rating and write this off as human error, but it genuinely disturbed my sleep that night and I think at a hotel of this caliber / price I shouldn't have been argued with.",4,2022,09,28
141,The best luxury boutique in central london,"The hotel it is amazingly clean, care for, staff it is friendly, location for who likes to be in the middle of a crowd perfect, but sooner you get in the hotel, quiet and peaceful. Breakfast it is very good but a bit much, fot what it is offered, i would stay there again.",5,2022,09,26
141,Central Location and Quiet!,"Amazing stay at the Londoner in a central location but very quiet! The room was massive with no detail spared ( the toilet was probably the coolest feature). Check out the gym too, state of the art! The service was very friendly and helpful. Stay here if you want luxury in the heart of London.",5,2022,09,25
141,First time back to London for 3 Covid years!,"This hotel has a superb location sitting just off Leicester Square.
It has no obvious arrival area being in a pedestrian precinct so limo drivers have a problem.
The lobby bar is a large inviting space with live music.
The main restaurant and breakfast room are off of the lobby area.
Check in was smooth and painless.
Residents have their own space called the residence where you can enjoy coffee, non alcoholic beverages and snacks all day.
At rooftop level is a Japanese restaurant and bar open certain nights.
Staff are in abundance to welcome you and offer assistance.
The rooms are chic modern and large by London standards.
Interesting artworks adorn all public areas.
Air conditioning works and is sensitive to need.
Another high tech toilet seat welcomes you in your room with built in bidet!
This is a premium boutique hotel and nightly costs reflect this.
Bar prices are high by any standard.
Staff are variable. 
Ladies in flowing dresses look good, but have no local knowledge of restaurants and seem to be for show purposes.
A request for a Lebanese restaurant was met by a google search but with no follow up reservation.
One doorman had no idea where The Strand was, another how to get to Bloomsbury.
The breakfast staff were either lovely or downright rude. Maybe they were New York restaurant trained.
This hotel is trying hard to be an icon…. but suffers from lack of poorly trained or new staff no doubt as a result of Covid and Brexit and are recovering from the downturn of the last two years. I have no doubt they will succeed.
I have no doubt they will succeed with some empathy and training.",4,2022,09,13
141,Pretentious Crap,"So looked forward to coming to this new hotel. No place for your car to drop you off, and you have to lug/drag bags 100+ yards.  No help from hotel doing that — we were on our own. The rooms are tiny. No drawers. Inches of closet space. No room to put your suitcases anywhere. Most (but not all, some of whom are gems) do not seem to have sufficient hospitality training for a deluxe hotel. Some are clueless (desk clerk did not know if she could give change for a large bill). Restaurant ridiculous prices for mediocre food. £39 for breakfast, but food is heated frozen or canned crap, and they don’t know how to cook eggs.  Stay away.  Stay far away.  Well, there are other quality hotels nearby.",1,2022,09,10
141,A UNIQUE EXPERIENCE,"Very beautiful modern luxury hotel, amazing and helpful staff.
Very good food, and modern gym and swimming pool, comfortable and spacious beautiful rooms with any kind of amenities. Definitely our hotel in London!",5,2022,09,09
141,Wonderful place to stay,"My stay at the Londoner was excellent. First impressions are not make or break, but they do matter a great deal. When I checked in, the staff member at the front desk, Maria, went above and beyond to make sure I would be comfortable during my stay. She changed my already nice room to one with a view of the London Eye and Big Ben. Essentially provided a full tour of the property while taking me up to my room, so I knew which amenities were available when and could make full use of them during my stay. Room service is 24 hours and offers a varied menu, all of the items from which I enjoyed. The location of the hotel is perfect for tourists like me, with so many sights within very walkable distances. Leicester Square is a lively area with plenty to keep you busy. I can’t think of anything I’d include in this review as something to potentially improve. Definitely recommend.",5,2022,09,06
141,"Location 10, Service 10, Style 10 - all round 10","We have stayed at this hotel twice and we absolutely love it. From the minute you arrive you’re made to feel welcome. The rooftop bar is awesome, hundreds of Japanese whiskies to choose from, cocktails, beautiful wines that you can’t normally get by the glass. The rooms are superb and the service is top notch. We also love the location, right by China Town and Soho. Not a bad word to say about this hotel, superb experience!",5,2022,09,03
141,Anniversary weekend,"Beautiful modern luxury hotel
Amazing Staffs, delicious authentic food, very modern gym and swimming pool, comfortable and spacious beautiful rooms. Hotel in the heart of Leicester Square ideal situation to enjoy the sights of London Town",5,2022,08,29
141,So good I have booked my next stay!,"Enjoyed a great stay here with my sister while we were on a girly trip. 

Check in - we arrived early around half one. We were seated promptly n the lobby and checked in quickly by a really friendly lady called Ozge. After she checked us in she took us on a tour of the hotel showing us all the facilities and then took us to our room. Really appreciated the early check in and the tour so we knew how to get to the spa and the guest lounge. 

Room - deluxe King - on the small side but really well designed. Plenty of space for our clothes. Loved having a steamer in the room. There was a good size TV, high quality toiletries and loved the Japanese toilet. Bed very comfortable and high quality linens. AMAZING pillows.  Shower drainage needs improving but great shower. 

We spent a great afternoon at the champagne bar in the lobby. Really nice staff. We also enjoyed a lovely breakfast in bed. Unfortunately didn’t have time to check out the roof bar but it looked lovely. 

It’s a well designed modern five star hotel. I have booked to return with my hubby next month and look forward to it.",5,2022,08,25
141,Amazing hotel,We stayed here for only 1 night as we were in London for a concert. We wish it had been for longer. It was an amazing hotel. The decor was beautiful. The staff were so friendly and helpful. The room was so comfortable and beautifully furnished. The Residence was a bar for residence and a fantastic touch. We will definitely be back,5,2022,08,18
141,Unparalleled,"Hotel was unreal. Staff where lovely especially aiden the receptionist who went above and beyond for us literally mad an Tripadvisor account to leave a review because of him. The spa was incredible, and I will never get over the toilets ( automatic opening, heated seat and bidet and dryer, ridiculous",5,2022,08,12
141,"Center of London, and Away From it All","A great location, center of London, but it felt like an oasis of luxury and exclusivity.  Many cool and swanky ""spaces"" in the hotel, from the rooftop Japanese bar and restaurant, to the champagne lounge in the lobby, to the primary restaurant, and then there were the exclusive areas available to the ""residences"" of the hotel.  Awesome whisky bar, fun family game room that felt like a super refined lounge, and the gym and pool/spa were top notch.",5,2022,08,08
141,Poor choice in trying this new hotel,"The experience was poor: we were allocated a room that was dusty and smelled of construction work. All we asked for was a deep clean of the room after the first night. This was not done and the room was not serviced in the 7 hours we were out. I asked to change rooms and we were allocated a SMALLER room! I had to fight with management about the poor service and the downgrade before we were allocated to another room comparable to the first that did not smell of construction. Lots of people said ""sorry"" a lot but not a lot was done. I got the impression of staffing and management chaos. Regarding the room changes, management said the policy was no upgrades even for poor experiences. We were comped with breakfast for the stay, but this was well below peer standards. I'm was however offered an upgrade after having stayed there, which only aggravates my frustrations rather than ameliorates them. All of which leaves me with regret that I tried this hotel rather than sticking to the London hotel that I trust (and prefer).",2,2022,08,02
141,"Amazing hotel, but slow check in","Absolutely amazing spa, and restaurant. The service by the young indian/south asian  man in the spa was amazing, he was so helpful and smiley! However, upon check in, a young inexperienced girl, was tremendously slow and couldn’t even tell me the number of my room. She seemed new. Quite a slow start to my stay which was the only downside.",4,2022,07,27
141,Wonderful and can’t wait to return!,"We just love this place! 
This was our second stay this year and the service, spa, bars, the room all excellent! The location is perfect you’re right in the middle of anything you need.
My only two grumbles are 1) the slippers, because on our first trip in March the slippers were amazing!!! I had my pair and my husbands I took them home and they lasted me ages! This time they were the bog standard throw aways. I was looking forward to some new slippers to take home 😂
2) the spa beds being reserved! I don’t agree with this, it should be on a first come first serve basis!
Aside from that I can’t wait to come back! Thank you to the staff for taking good care of us and making us feel so welcome",5,2022,07,24
141,Some good some bad points,"This hotel has some lovely interiors and architectural details, it was made by the famous studio Yabu & Pushelberg, so you get some lovely details and rooms. Plus excelent central position.
Unfortunately it has some serious down sides as well: 
the Spa had the sauna, steam bath and jacuzzy completely out of service but they seemed quite relaxed about this.
The concierge even if made by a group of nice and smiling guys knew nothing about London. Out of 2 question asked we got 2 misleading answers: we were about to lose the Harry Potter tour because of that ( completely wrong trains indications) plus they didn’t know the timing for visiting the horses baracks and we went there for nothing. I was wondering in the last day if risking to order a taxi through them but I took the chance: it came one with no credit cards accepted that took us in a spooky place in order to give him cash. So this is the Concierge service: the worse I got so far, sorry guys. 
The restaurant is fine, good food but even there was not a single time they got the order right.
The reception girls are nice and I guess they save a bit their colleagues.
Overall splendid hotel in central position with bad services, next time we’ll try some other place.",3,2022,07,23
141,A must stay hotel,"As a first time visitor in London, I was not sure what to expect. It was beyond my expectation. 
The staff was beyond friendly and 100% service oriented.  On our second night, we were late for dinner in neighboring Restaurant’s. Voila!  The front desk personnel (I wish I could remember his name) suggested we try 8 at Londoner. Considering it seemed to be more of a bar, the food was quite exceptional; arguably some of the best food we’ve had in London, although slightly pricey.",5,2022,07,17
141,BETTER SERVICE IN A HOSTEL!,"If I could give this no stars I would!
This should not be a 5 star hotel..
Not even worthy of 2 in my eyes. 
All the reviews on Google have to be fake. 
People saying it’s the best hotel in the world. 
You really must have only stayed at hostels to be making a statement like that. 
Let’s start with the the first mess up of a night stay. 
City deluxe room you can’t even swing a cat in. 
Small and pokey (More room in a travel lodge standard room)
The photos are totally catfished on their website for sizing so be aware of this. 
When we arrived we were shattered as we’d been traveling so decided not to say anything and try and sleep in it for one night as the 3 night stay was bought for me for a birthday gift. 
We wake up and I only ordered  a coffee and orange juice for myself and my GF. 
This took almost an hour to come. 
I ask for an iron and ironing board as not supplied in the room. 
This took almost 45 mins to come and when it did the iron was covered in black burn stains. 
(THATS NOT 5 STAR SERVICE)
We’d then decided we’d like a bigger room call down to complain about the service we’d received so far. 
And manager was going to show us a larger room after my shower. 
And is then busy so we decide to look at room later after our day out. 
Get back, I’m took upstairs to look at larger room and my GF is downstairs at the bar with literally 3 couples in it so it’s not busy at all. 
I come back down and she’s still not been even offered a menu or asked if she’d like a drink. 
She’d seated herself, and when I come down surprised at this I ask the lady staff member why she’d not been offered a drink or menu and her rude reply was 
‘That table is reserved, I’m working alone can you move tables please?’
‘I’ve got an afternoon tea on that table’
There was 3 couples in the bar! 
Like sorry are you for real??
There was no reserve sign on table she then walks off flapping and muttering under her breath, still not asking us if we’d like a drink or menu. 
We’re around 25 mins into sitting there by now and decide to leave and not even eat. 
Totally shocking! 
Later on I complain and due to the amount of mess ups they kindly offer us a signature suite complimentary so we’re very happy about this and I’d have not have left this review if what I’m about to tell you didn’t happen. 
We get into said suite. 
The shower doesn’t work the water comes out the shower base of the head. 
The mini bar had not been restocked and had a pot of noodles left in it from the previous tenant. 
And the air-con when we turned it off stayed on!
Like you could not make this up!
Our third night we returned to a city deluxe room that was slightly bigger then the first offering and we finally had a reasonable nights sleep and stay without something going wrong. 
So much went wrong they did comp us all our extras which was probably around £350
However for what they charge and the service we received we should have got then whole stay for free!!
No one even helped us with our bags after all that had happened even when we left.
Shocking from start to finish should be 2-3 star at most. 
Most of the staff seem untrained and incompetent of running a 5 star establishment. 
I can’t help but feel someone has received a envelope of cash to give this place 5 stars because I just can’t see where this star rating comes from. 
Book into a real 5 star in London if you’re thinking of staying here and paying there prices. 
It’s really not worth it to stay here. 
Also there is no security at the door and when we returned one evening there was a large gang outside so I was happy I wasn’t wearing an expensive watch. 
Made us feel very uncomfortable.",1,2022,07,17
141,AMAZINGGGG!!!!,"Ok so I’ve only been here a few hours but can’t believe how amazing the experience has been already. Booked through AMEX so have been given a very generous upgrade and checked in by Paul who was lovely ( been given a corner suite with amazing views of Big Ben). Service from reception and all staff has been incredible. Hotel is spotless, smells amazing, staff are polite and make us feel like royalty, literally. There’s a ‘guest only’ bar/lounge with complimentary snacks for guests which we’ve taken advantage of. Stayed in a lot of the best London hotels and this one is very much just as good or if not better! ",5,2022,07,16
141,Looks the part - lacks the ‘je ne sais qoui’,"In terms of the venue itself - you cannot fault the place. Impressive decor and very classy spaces inside - some real thought has gone into this venue.

Room was a king room. Not the biggest but everything inside is to the highest standard - dyson hairdryer, marble bathroom, Japanese toilet. Bed was super comfortable. Tv was also really good as you can order room service through it and even purchase items In the room like the duck umbrella should you desire to do so! I requested a ironing board/iron through the tv and it came within half hour so you can’t fault the tech!

What this place lacks is the extra ‘je ne sais qoui’ for example, we booked this hotel for 2 nights then went on to another 5* hotel in London for the final night (although in the other place we stayed in a suite) at around £500 a night here it wasn’t far off the £650 suite we had in the other hotel. 

The difference was, the other hotel actually asked me and emailed me ahead of time to check if we were celebrating an occasion - and indeed yes we were. This was a personal email and not just a link to a electronic booking site which the londoner used (which I found out at checkin hadn’t worked anyway) the fact it was my birthday weekend celebrations with my girlfriend was acknowledged by the other hotel and used as an opportunity for the hotel to create a lasting impression.

This is what the Londoner lacks, at no point did anyone on front desk (or beforehand) ask about anything to do with the trip. It feels like as far as they are concerned you’re just another entry in/out and the guest experience doesn’t really feel personal at all. For that reason I’d say there’s an extra star missing for this venue which it needs to work on to be considered a truly luxury 5* hotel. The price range this hotel is operating in (aside from commanding a fee for its central location) I believe is behind other hotels in the same price bracket.",4,2022,07,12
141,Perfect option for luxury & private stay ,"I admit that I choose to stay in this hotel with hesitance as I was afraid that the area would be a little bit noisy and crowded but from tyw minute I stepped in the lobby, I was relieved I made the right choice. Its a hassel that the cars can't reach the hotel directly but they are working on it (license approval). I was welcomed by Biatrece who took me to the room and gave briefing on the pool and residence (exclusive area for hotel guests where you can have complimentary light drinks & meals). I loved every single detail in my room which was grand deluxe and updated to a city grand deluxe. Staff was amazing and helpful. So neat and clean hotel. I stayed for more than 20 nights and I'm coming back as this hotel became my favourite. No single bad remarks during my stay as everything was taken care off. The pool is nice too and I tried the food at the 8th floor but I liked the ambience more than the food. I would say this is the destination for all whom looking for luxury and privacy.",5,2022,07,11
141,Our clothes is disappeared,"I stayed in this hotel on July 6 till July 11
The hotel is very nice , but they made a huge mistake that no one, whether in your own house or a laundry shop, would ever make.  I left my newly clothes hanged in toilet after I wash them for drying on July 8. When I came back my clothes were gone!!
I contacted the reception. At first they didn’t know where it is gone!!

They told me that they do not know where it is gone! This is funny and shocking. We were just astonished after two days of reviewing the cameras. 
Before I left the room, I told the housekeeper I want it hanged to dry. And I sayed 3 times in English (please keep it to dry). After 2 days of searching, they told me that the housekeeper confessed and it was his mistake.
What should I do in this strict situation?",3,2022,07,10
141,"5* star looks, 7* star prices, but no 5* service!","The hotel is fairly new and we loved the decor. I had a business lunch here when it just opened and it was fantastic! All so fresh, modern and the attention in the details is amazing. Same must be said for the rooms and hallways. No dull hallway to your room whatsoever! 

Our main issue was that there was dust and some hairs on the floor when we arrived. When saying something about this next day was somewhat odd (friends of ours booked and paid for the stay), the cleaning lady would come by straight away. Only to find out that when she left, both were still on the floor! After a second complaint my friends got a message from the hotel, which was very embarrassing. In the end the hotel compt. our group of 6 breakfast for 2 days. 

My other complaint was that we wanted to celebrate our friends that booked the stay. When asking at the front desk to arrange something in the hotel roof top bar, we were redirected to the concierge, who redirected us to the agent of the roof top bar, who redirected us to a telephone number. In the end we arranged a welcome, good spot and bottle of champagne. All to find out we were seated in the most boring part and when sat down, the waiter come back with the menu. Only after saying no, check your booking, he came back with the champagne. 

Lastly, make sure to book things ahead. It was very busy weekend in London (Pride, Adele, Wimbledon), but we are used to these kinds of hotels to keep certain seats open for guests of the hotel. No such thing here, every bar/lounge area is operated separately. On the last day one lady told us there was actually a bar for guests of the hotel on the second floor, with free soft drinks and some snacks. briljant! If only we had known before. We paid for soft drinks for 2 days downstairs, nobody told us about this bar. 

So all in all the property is 5*, the rooms are fantastic, a cleaning mix-up can always happen. It's the lack of attention to offer guests a full service experience by making sure that they don't need to search and room the hotel themselves to arrange stuff. Lets remind you that the cheapest rooms at this hotel were $700/$800 per night! 

Based on this experience, we would not go back.",3,2022,07,10
141,Excellent stay at the Londoner for a peaceful vacation in the center of London,"outstanding new designed hotel with all the facilities . comftable rooms. great location. wondeful service with a very hospitable stuff. 
I would come again for sure ! 
If you are visiting London don't miss this special hotel",5,2022,07,09
141,VERY GOOD FOOD AND SERVICE,"Dinner here with family.  Wonderful hotel with excellent food, wine and service,  Extensive menu. Very expensive even by London standards but you must go to hotels of this quality in Leicester Square with your eyes open.",4,2022,07,09
141,Liars and thieves,"Stayed here for 5 nights and at first I was enjoying my stay but the end of my experience ruined my whole week. 

I waited 25 minutes to check out (long lines in the lobby are a common occurrence) and when I reached the front desk there were over 100 pounds of completely wrong charges on my bill. I was falsely charged a lunch I never had at the hotel and they charged me the daily hotel fee for breakfast for two people while I was traveling by myself. 

To make matters worse the staff member who was helping me had no idea what he was doing and couldn’t answer any of my very basic questions and kept disappearing into the back to get advice from other colleagues. I got other staff involved and THREE of them promised me that the invoice would be updated shortly and sent to me that day. 

Two weeks after my stay a new invoice was never sent to me and they charged me the original invoice amount. I tried to call the hotel and they told me the billing department is “busy” and to leave my contact information and they would call me back, but of course they never did.",1,2022,07,09
141,Kind of Disappointing,"This is a beautiful high end (fairly expensive) hotel in a great location. The interior spaces are bespoke, pleasing and the furniture is quality, mostly comfortable, and to a high standard. The technology in the rooms works well.  The bathrooms are gorgeous.  The Whitcomb's Restaurant is excellent and the roof club on the 8th floor is edgy and worth the effort. What is disappointing is 1) the large loud crowd that congregates in the lobby (almost the whole lobby is the lobby bar); 2) the inconsistent service from the hotel staff, and 3) the attitude of the place.  It's more ""W"" than ""Claridges"" and a lot of the surface is without substance.",3,2022,07,05
141,Really average visit,"Staff were not great, not very accommodating, not terribly welcoming. Food was really poor, was disappointed. The venue is beautiful, nice to walk into and good sitting areas, if a little dark. Definitely would say the venue has room for improvement.",3,2022,07,04
141,Just ok…,"I booked the hotel for my husbands birthday and we left slightly underwhelmed by the whole experience. 

Positives. The rooms, although very small and lacking hanging space are nicely done and to a high finish. The TV screen in the room is handy and you can order extras such as pillows.. The retreat is great, the service by the pool was prompt, the gym and pool area were very clean and it’s a lovely place to relax and unwind for a couple of hours. The service in the stage bar was also good, location is brilliant if wanting to explore London and the breakfast was very tasty. 

Negatives. Communication prior to arrival was slow, the check in was chaotic and the area very busy with clearly not enough staff to care for guests. 

I’d ordered balloons to be in the room on arrival but this wasn’t done, although a bottle of champagne and chocolates were which was well received and thoughtful. We had no slippers to walk down to the spa and a turn down service wasn’t undertaken one evening. The Japanese toilet kept flushing itself one evening and waking us up and with very little room in the bathroom, went off every time you were anywhere near it! 

In the French restaurant, again, service was painfully slow however the food when we did receive it was nice. Service in the residence was also slow with our cocktails taking 20 minutes to arrive. Service throughout the entire stay, even though prompt in the pool area, was not 5*. The way in which staff address and communicate with you is a far cry from that at Claridges and other 5* hotels. 

As hotel guests, we were unable to get a night cap on returning from dinner with the bar man telling us it was a long day and he needed to close up. 

Treatments in the spa were good, but not worthy of the price tag. 

Breakfast, although lovely, isn’t worth £39 a head. 

My final point is that at check out, the lady asked how my stat was and I advised some great aspects but some, especially the service could have been much better. She didn’t seem to care at all and was more bothered about me clearing the extra charges on the room. I was overcharged by £170 despite advising the lady the bill was wrong when she ran through this with me verbally. She advised she’d check and send me the invoice through shortly. Despite paying gratuity throughout, the hotel added extra optional service charges and 3 x breakfast charges per person! We only had breakfast one morning. It just summed up the service throughout the stay and caused inconvenience having to ring, be put through to the right department and explain why the bill was incorrect. 

We are lucky enough to have stayed in other 5* hotels in London and to pitch itself at the same level I believe is what let’s it down as it doesn’t compare or meet the 5* London expectations. 

I think the hotel has the potential and maybe with more time will improve but for now pay a little more and explore the other 5* hotels!",3,2022,07,03
141,Nice fit out but dark and a bit depressing,"Good spot, stylish but overpriced. The fit out is really high quality but the hotel feels dark and there is little outside space. Perhaps understandable given it’s location on Leicester Square but never the less a bit depressing. The room we stayed in was a deluxe king and again was very nicely fitted but very small for the price at £700 a night and the bathroom is tiny and part open to the room. Little or no storage is an issue for stays more than a day or so with a  half size single wardrobe. No glasses for the drinks in the mini bar or hairdryer, but then there was nowhere to put them either as furniture is so limited in the room, just a bed, a chaise and two bedsides. 

To summarise, it wasn’t bad, but in my view expensive for the offering and we won’t be going back probably. There are much better places for the money.",3,2022,07,03
141,Dressed to impress but did not deliver,"The hotel is in a great position in London and the marketing suggested as a boutique 5 star  hotel it is competing against the traditional upmarket London 5 Star market. 
It looks lovely but the problems started the moment we arrived. Check in is 3 and the hotel was overwhelmed by people and certainly complaining why the rooms were not ready. 
We had booked a room with use of the retreat so after travelling down from Scotland we decided to go to that area. It is on a mezzanine floor above the main seating area. So still noisy. Staff were generally nice and we had some champagne and gin and tonics. None of which were complimentary despite their inefficiencies. This hotel needs to show the guests it facilities such as the rooftop bar and spa before you go to your room. Because of travel and lateness of the room we went straight to the room. Let me say the design is clever and lovely but very small compared to the other hotels they are competing against. It is comfortable but underwhelming. 
To be fair to the hotel the next day a bottle of English sparkling wine arrived unannounced with no card. So I think it was an apology ? The hotel does have nice touches and the rooftop bar and restaurant and the music in the main area is lovely. However it is not good value for money in comparison to the Langham or Savoy or Dorchester. They are far better. They need to work on things or they will always have customers leave with a feeling of “could have should have been much better”.",3,2022,07,02
141,The entire property is a great experience,"We came to London to see Elton John in Hyde Park. A contact suggested I try the Londoner and after checking it out online I am thrilled that I took the recommendation. I have stayed in a number of London hotels over the years and this was a fantastic return after three years. Everything about this place is a wonderful experience - even when just sitting with a drink and taking it all in. The design is beautiful in practically every part of the hotel. The food and drink options as well as the places you can them really added to our trip there. Of course, all of that comes with a certain cost, but totally worth it and we didn’t just use the hotel for a place to sleep. The Residence concept is a great one - it’s only available to guests where the other spaces are also open to the public which is fine too because there was a great vibe of people everywhere. We had a morning cappuccino in the Residence, had some light pastry and yogurts, read the paper. A great relaxed way to start the day. We also did the residence one of the afternoons for a bit of cheese and small bites. All included with the stay. Two important things for me to note because I find them personally important. I was there with my partner and was always very comfortable for us to sit together or with an arm around the other. We were importantly made to feel like ourselves and welcomed. The second is the quality of the concierge people. They were excellent. Btw, go see Jerusalem at the Apollo Theatre. Was an incredible performance! The service was top notch and nothing was too small or basic of a request. We got great recommendation to go see Hampstead and made a stop in Camden which was a great day. I always want to be balanced but struggling to think of anything to improve. I was very happy with everything. Stayed in room 834 which is the top floor and has a view overlooking Trafalgar Square - bonus we could see the Canadian High Commission flags from our room. Also had a great view of Big Ben and parliament tower. It’s the exact same view as the restaurant terrace right above our floor so you can experience that the same way if not on the 8th floor. I will definitely return here. It’s a great experience from start to finish.",5,2022,07,02
141,Amazing Experience - Will be Back,"Had a fantastic 5 night stay at The Londoner and everything was perfect. Great amenities, engaging staff, fantastic Concierge and the facility itself was beautiful. 

Ate several meals there and all very good and bar has a great energy as does their rooftop lounge. 

Location was perfect as we were there for business and leisure. Easy to get around and liked that the theater district was close by so lots of good pubs and restaurants within walking distance. 

This is a new hotel and look forward to making it my go-to London property.",5,2022,07,01
141,Great service and amazing location,"Looking at the other reviews, not sure if I was an anomaly or they were but I had great service and was quite surprised by the attention to detail they provided.  I booked through the Amex Fine Hotels and Resorts program and stayed for one night.  My primary reason for picking this was the location (right on Leicester square) and reasonable cost (for a 5 star hotel in London). 

I arrived around 11:00 am and was fairly easily able to get the reception.  My room was already ready (I think I was upgraded to the Deluxe King room but not sure what the difference is) and the front desk staff member took my luggage and walked with me to my room and showed me the room along with its features.  The room was very nice with wood floors, beautiful bathrooms and a Japanese toilet (best feature).  There's also some quirky items like a unique radio and fancy binoculars.  I left shortly after to explore the city and imagine my surprise when I returned to find a bottle of champagne and to find my room completely remade (even though I just checked in a few hours earlier).   After leaving again for an evening show, I returned to a quite nice turndown service with the room remade again.  Service wise, I have no complaints.

While here, I checked out the rooftop bar which has a great view but definitely go for the drinks and not the food (which I found a bit underwhelming).   There's a whisky bar in the Residence lounge if you ask but it is quite expensive (though not overly upcharged).  The breakfast was very good at the Whitcomb which was a buffet though again I would recommend ordering off the menu for some of the specialty items.  The pancakes were pretty good.

Overall, I was quite impressed with my stay and with the service I received though for the price, that should be expected.",5,2022,06,28
141,"Amazing atmosphere,","The live music in the Stage Bar makes it am amazing atmosphere.  The 1729 cocktail is one of my favourites, I highly recommend it to anyone looking for a two o  one cocktail, you'll understand what I mean when you try it.",5,2022,06,28
141,Wouldn’t stay again.,"We stayed for 1 night as a birthday treat - for the money we wouldn’t stay again for what we received. 
As  others mentioned, check in was awful, after travelling we were bursting for the toilet and there was only one staff member on front desk who was dealing with a lengthy incident so several families left waiting. Check out was also the same! We over heard another couple complaining amongst themselves about this and saying every time they had been down to reception there was a wait. We saw other staff members floating around but none who were able to or wanted to help. Door staff were however very friendly , chatty and polite. 

Our room was comfortable enough but wouldn’t say stunning - green carpet (I know this is personal choice!) and lights were not great, especially when wanting to dim them late at night. Bathroom was not private with ceiling to floor windows I could see straight into other peoples rooms.  The toilets however were very nice! There were crumbs left in the bedside drawer. 

Room service weren’t great, we ordered breakfast at approximately 9am and were told it would be up to an hours wait. Ok fine we thought, our fault as we didn’t prebook. It took well over an hour and arrived cold and bacon hard. We also requested when we ordered that they bring sauces up and they forgot. We rang down & requested new breakfasts (whosever answered the phone was not apologetic, seemed like they were sighing under their breath!) and it arrived hot however missing a sausage from a full English, and again sauces and butter for the toast missing. The staff had to run back up and down so many times we felt sorry for them and this was also awkward… especially when they aren’t apologetic we felt like we were being a pain, but realistically, when you are paying £60+ for 2 basic breakfasts, you expect a little more from the service. We understand everyone is human and makes mistakes but we felt like we were made out to be the inconvenience! Perhaps they should bring sauces and butter etc up with room service as standard to save the staff having to travel back up and down 7 floors. 

Lastly check out was slow and we saw 2 others complaining as we left, one for an issue with a massage and one with an issue having a refund. The lady on reception with curly hair was nice & asked how our stay was … we said ok thank you and our issues. She just replied with sorry to hear that. We don’t like to complain and this just felt awkward, what was the point of us explaining if she wasn’t going to ensure she would feed back that information, or even, to be honest we weren’t expecting to pay for the room service but wasn’t going to kick up a fuss and ask for it to be removed. 

For us this was considered a treat and something we only do a few times a year. So sorry if these issues seem trivial, however I have to be honest the experience was not great, but could have all been rectified if staff were a little more apologetic and enthusiastic about smoothing our small issues easily! For a similar price we have recently had a flawless stay at the Berkeley.",2,2022,06,27
141,A mess,"I stayed here at the end of May and it was a non-stop comedy of errors. I think a major thing is the cleaning personnel are severely understaffed. You can see in other reviews that many people are having difficulty getting checked in on time.

I specifically booked this hotel through the Amex Fine Hotels and Resorts program because I was arriving on a red eye and early check in was important to me. Two days prior to arrival they sent me a link to an app to check in prior to arrival. “Great this should speed the check in process up,” I thought. Ha! 

I pre- checked in, chose a room, and after several attempts entered my cc number. Specified I would be arriving at 11 AM.
My flight was delayed and I arrived at 12:45 PM. I got to the front desk and they told me “sorry, the room is not available,” and instructed me to sit in a nice waiting area. I explained that I would like a room on the back side as there was loud construction in Leicester Sq. “Yes, you are being upgraded to a city view room,” was the response. At 2 PM I was still sitting around and went back to the desk to inquire about the status of my room.
I have used the FHR program over 30 times I have NEVER not gotten an early check in. They assured me they were doing everything they could to get me a room. They said every room was occupied etc etc (def not true, it was a Wednesday).  I think the inability to turn over rooms is simply the hotel being cheap on hiring cleaning staff. (see below as well) At about 2:45 someone came to the lounge and told me my room was ready. (Btw I was asked for my cc at reception. I said “sure but don’t you have it? I entered it in your system to pre check in?” “Oh yep ok” they said. Then when I was told my room was ready the SAME PERSON asked me for my cc again.)
I was not upgraded and I was put on the Leicester Square side. He said “oh there’s double glaze windows, you shouldn’t hear anything.” Get to my room (zero cleaning carts in the hall) and guess what… loud jackhammering clearly audible from the room.

So, despite paying a premium through FHR, I didn’t get an early check in, didn’t get a room upgrade, and wasn’t even put in a room on one of the three sides of the hotel I requested. 

The door to my room was so difficult to open I thought I must be missing some hip new design feature. Nope, after putting the keycard on the reader I had to shoulder check the door hard to open it each time. 

The disappointments continued- 
1. used their app to order room service. Called room service to confirm they had received order- no they had not. Room service arrived and was missing a drink I had ordered. 
2. Room service menu is extremely limited, especially for a hotel with several restaurants 
3. The shower didn’t drain and of course it was a modern design with no edge to it so there was water all over the floor of the room every time I showered. No electrical outlets in the bathroom area (which is small and open to room) 
4. Asked for room to be serviced one day when I left at 1 PM and came back at 5:30 to find it hadn’t been cleaned 
5. At checkout the receptionist said I had used the entirety of my $150 FHR property credit. I asked “hmm how could that be? I don’t think I ordered that much.” She said “yes just here and there, like 7 pounds, 20 pounds, etc” I said “were my breakfasts included as per FHR?” She said yep, yep, they got that. I pressed again. She finally looked at my bill line by line and said “hmm.. there is a charge here for a Breakfast that is classified as lunch….” yep, 3 of my breakfasts were put in the system wrong. Mistakes happen. But she didn’t allow me to see my itemized bill and brushed off my questions. 
6. Finally after settling my bill I mentioned my shower not draining. She said “oh, I’m sorry, I wish you had told me maybe I could have done something.” I realized I didn’t bring it up right away because she had not done the most basic thing every hotel including a 2 star does- asked me “how was your stay?” 

In short, the stay was one of the worst hotel experiences I’ve had. Any of the above alone would have been fine but it was issue after issue, and at that price point there should be none. I will say the doormen were fantastic and I’d be remiss if I didn’t thank them for helping me get a taxi multiple times.",1,2022,06,26
141,"A 4 star hotel, not a 5 star","We booked the hotel for a one night stay. We booked a standard room.

The check in was a bit disorganised but I must mention Ash who gave us a full tour of the hotel and made us feel very welcome. 

If you are looking to book this hotel or a Premier Inn, book the Premier Inn as there is no difference apart from a heated toilet seat and will save you a lot of money.

We had a drink at the Stage bar before dinner- was pleasant.

We had a Lounge booking at the roof top bar/lounge for 5pm. We arrived and were asked what we would eat (nibbles or meal) - we said we didn't know as we hadn't seen the menu so got taken to the garden area . We were given a menu which has all of a handful of choices. We asked to be seated in the other area as originally booked to be told it depends on availability. The waitress brought out the additional menu, which had roughly two or three more options than the menu we had originally seen. We ordered and our food came within a minute (not exaggerating) and we still had no drinks.

We did complain, no Manager came to discuss, we signed the bill and took our business elsewhere.

We returned at 11pm, no turn down service (which I would expect from a 5 star hotel, although not a deal breaker).

I must add that the hand wash, shampoo and conditioner bottles were half full on arrival. I appreciate there were some for us to use, but it's just shoddy housekeeping to not keep it topped up for new guests each time.

The breakfast - waste of money £60 for both of us. Just go to All Bar One across the road and save your money. Having to self serve an English Breakfast, but ask for toast is bizarre. Only option at self serve is scrambled egg, not sure how it would work if you ordered fried but sat down with a plate of food - I had lost interest to bother at this point. You pay extra for some served options- but do you get the money back for what you've already paid for...who knows.

The very swish heated toilet kept giving itself a rinse all throughout the night - drove us mad.

Check out was slow but ok. We did tell the receptionist about our experience and she did deduct some of the items from the roof top bar for the inconvenience- that is appreciated but I am happy to pay for decent service and food.

In conclusion, I would not recommend nor return to this hotel. It over complicates the simple things e.g. which side of a restaurant-nibbles or meal, breakfast - half served, half self serve. 

I have been fortunate to stay in many of the 5 star hotels in London and this hotel doesn't come close. If you want 5 star, you can book a room at the well known London hotels for a similar price and get a much better standard. 

This hotel has to go back to the drawing board and nail the basics first.",3,2022,06,25
141,A Bit Pricey Despite Great Location,"Look - you can't beat the location.  The hotel sits right in Leicester Square so if you want to be slap bang in the middle of everything, this is your spot.  But the rooms are expensive.  We spent I think almost $1800 for two standard rooms, one of which we extended to a day room for late checkout the next day so we had somewhere to hang  before a late flight departure.

I stayed for one night with my son in late May.  We had two standard king rooms.  The rooms were nice - comfortable bedding, great showers (no tubs) very modern with all modern amenities.  Interior hallways very dark and moody - I suppose they want a ""clubby atmosphere"" That's what it felt like.

Checking in could have been smoother - we checked in just before 5 - almost two hours after 3pm advertised check-in.  But one of the rooms was not ready.  It took a manager to move us around to accommodate but still - rooms still not ready two hours after advertised checkin??

Lobby that evening was a scene - kind of like what you'd expect at the W - lots of hipsters ordering bespoke cocktails and a line to get to the rooftop bar (which we did not visit).  bar service was very good - bar tenders were quick and attentive.  Breakfast service not so much however - had to ask three times for a simple cup of coffee.  Buffet was decent but again - almost £40? Too much.

Another reason for docking a star was this bizarre policy of taking a £100 deposit per room on my credit card for incidentals.  Huh?  Never in my life.  Why not pay for incidentals upon checkout like...any other hotel I've ever stayed at around the world?  This created some distrust quite frankly, as now I felt like I had to account for all charges and make sure I got credited the difference back to my card upon checkout, which meant standing in an unnecessary line rather than just leaving the hotel knowing incidentals will be charged because they have my credit card on file!  For this reason, I don't think I'll stay here again.

I will leave on a positive note though.  While the doorman was hailing us a cab to get to the HEX at Paddington, he asked us if we had checked our rooms, emptied our safes etc - I had not - I had left my passport in my safe! I was whisked back up to my room by a manager with a ""God Key"" and I retrieved my passport from the safe without incident.  SO that Doorman literally saved the rest of my vacation because who knows when I would have discovered my passport was missing.  I tipped him quite generously as you can imagine.",4,2022,06,22
141,"Too expensive, even for this great location","As a real treat, I purchased a corner suite for my wife and I as we visited London for a long postponed trip to see 'To kill a Mockingbird' in the Gielgud theatre. I was so disappointed with the room size and amenities. Nothing really to distinguish it from a Premier Inn room except for a heated toilet seat. I would advise people considering this hotel to book the cheapest possible room. The location is fantastic, especially for the West End. We walked everywhere. There are lots of bar and restaurant options. Breakfast was very disappointing though, limited choice, packed restaurant, tinned orange juice. Again for the price and style of hotel I was expecting much better. Positives - location, location, location. It's a stylish hotel, beautiful artworks around. The residence lounge for guests is very nice and relaxing. The concierge was excellent and got us a booking in a fantastic restaurant nearby for a pre-theatre meal with a couple of hours notice. Don't bother taking the option to check in online before you arrive, you still go through the same nonsense when you get there.",3,2022,06,20
141,Don't waste your money,"*Updated review* I've requested my invoice several times as well as raising the below concerns with the hotel and had zero response. I stayed over 2 weeks ago and would expect at least my invoice in that time? I'm well travelled and this place has left the worst taste in my mouth.

Having paid above £1200 for 2 nights - expectations were high. I've stayed in multiple 5* hotels around the world but this was the least impressive and most expensive. Full description below but in short: rooms are small, service is hit & miss. Main gripe is that the cost doesn't deliver a good experience.

I like to occasionally splash out on a luxury hotel stay and I was looking forward to experiencing the offering at The Londoner.

There were some goods: location is awesome, the shower is great, high quality appointments and swimming pool area. The Residence is a gem.

The disappointments began early on: I was left queuing in the reception area for a while whilst staff walked past me serving other guests, until finally a receptionist asked if they could assist, to which I requested if I could check in.

I'd booked a special offer that stated I'd receive a ""free upgrade"" at check-in - however this was unavailable. Fair enough - although I should state that rooms above my grade were available online for the duration of my stay. So what is the point of the offer?

Having been shown to my ""Deluxe King City View"" room I was immediately surprised by how small it was, even by London standards. The room was barely wider than the length of the bed. Agreeably the appointments were high quality, but I've had more space in a mid-level Tokyo hotel room! Additionally, the window was completely blocked by a sofa, which for a ""city view"" room seems pretty odd... I couldn't even get to the window without moving the sofa myself! Stupid design flaw.

The 'wash area' was great, not private and entirely part of the bedroom so I won't call it a 'bathroom' and indeed there wasn't actually a bath - only a shower - which I was surprised at. I had expected there might be a bath to relax in at this price point.

On my second/final day staying at the hotel, I arrived back to my room at 4pm after a packed day of walking and exploring the city - disappointingly I arrived back to my room to discover that housekeeping had only just begun servicing my room. It was entirely too awkward to sit watching the housekeeper (not least because the room was so very small) so I had to retreat to the bar area to wait while my room was serviced... when all I wanted to do was take my shoes off and rest my tired feet. Which I expected I would be able to do by 4pm on a resident day! Further more, about 30 mins after I returned to my room a supervisor entered my room to check whether it had been serviced! Despite the fact I had ""do not disturb"" turned on. Needless to say, he was very apologetic, but I'd already been embarrassed by being caught in my underwear by staff entering my room. In a ***5 star hotel***

A minor annoyance was the fact that there was a vast array of lighting functions in the room: 1: control panel inside the door, 2: on each bed side as well as 3: being controlled through the television. But ultimately there is no way of turning individual lights on or off. So I could either have the entire room on ""dim"" or ""bright"" but I couldn't, for example, just turn on a single bedside light or a room lamp in the corner. This is something I've *never* experienced as being annoying previously - but it's completely overengineered in this hotel. What's wrong with a switch?

The TV in the room welcomed me by name, however it had the completely wrong check-in and check-out dates, and the ""My Bill"" display had no relation to my actual charges. When I inquired about both of these with the reception I was told ""not to worry"" because the reception record was 'correct'

The Residence area of this hotel is great, it was completely empty for our entire stay and offers free drinks and snacks. We went here for coffee, fruit juices, nibbles and breakfast items. We did alert staff that none of the electric Japanese ""Toto"" facilities in the Residence were actually functioning properly... but along with other advisements - we weren't offered an apology. Not usually an issue, but if you're going to espouse a 5* rating and charge this rate...

Finally - the main reason I opted for this hotel instead of other *cheaper* 5 star hotels was the underground pool spa area, this was a great area! Four storeys underground and Mediterranean temperatures plus loungers makes it feel like you are on summer holidays, year round. If anything, this could be a bigger and more spacious area for guests. Indeed, I tried to reserve a kabana but was initially was told I didn't need to because it wasn't busy however when I arrived at the pool it was packed and was asked if I had a reservation... I then made a reservation for later that day. Once we returned and was placed in a kabana area I did thoroughly enjoy this - but would suggest there was some linked up communication on this so guests don't arrive ready in their robes and slippers only to be turned away.

Ultimately this is a good hotel, but extremely over priced to the point of leaving a bad taste in your mouth and a recommendation that you don't waste hard earned cash here. Rather book other more valuable 5* or 4* hotels where your money will go much further and won't eject you feeling sour about wasting your cash.",1,2022,06,18
141,Worst London Stay,"The only good think about this hotel is the location. There are no views, very inflexible despite the amount you pay for the room etc. Management staff lack the concept of customer service and are rather rude. The worst stay we have ever had in London. Avoid!",1,2022,06,17
141,Fabulous hotel,"Amazing service from Fatima, Antonio and the team, great service and cocktails. They were very attentive and professional also offering a friendly, warm service. Thank you from us all. James from sales was a fabulous host for the business",5,2022,06,15
141,Sense of calm in the centre of London,"Our stay at The Londoner was definitely the best choice for a retreat Staycation. We felt welcomed from the moment we stepped into the hotel lobby - Maria was very nice and I was offered a complimentary beverage while she was processing the check-in. From the moment we entered the hotel, we were already immersed in The Londoner atmosphere; the lobby set the perfect mood with live music. 

The room was bright and beautiful; the bathroom has all the amenities you might need  and the bed is extra comfortable. We had stated when booking the room it was our friend's 30th birthday and staff arranged free wine and a ""Happy 30th ballon"" in the room - a perfect welcome touch! Next morning we went to the SPA (highly recommended to go early in the morning, we were alone) and then had breakfast. The selection is varied and the quality of the food is good. Kevin was really helpful and offered a great service. 

By the end of our stay, we all felt relaxed and recharged. It was a very nice experience and our friend will forever remember her 30th birthday  - thank you The Londoner!",5,2022,06,12
141,A welcome addition to London,"We stayed here in May as we had theatre tickets locally and we wanted to try this hotel. 

As soon as you walk in, you can feel a real buzzy vibe, and everything looks brand new, there is a restaurant on the right, a large bar area, and lots of entertainment in the form of rooftop bars and whisky rooms. Something for everyone! 

We did have a problem at check-in, our room wasn’t ready and we were asked to wait, but it did drag on for a little while, around an hour or so. I think that we might have been overlooked but when we went back to enquire, the lovely Maria helped us and gave us a very decent upgrade by way of an apology. 

The room was a decent size, clean and very bright, nice big comfortable bed and large bathroom too. 

Location wise, you can’t get better. The entrance is right on Leicester Square, you can see all the people partying outside but the noise doesn’t carry over into the rooms. 

We had dinner in Whitcombs which was very nice, plentiful and very friendly staff too.

Breakfast was great, lots of choice from either cooked or buffet style menus. 

On checkout I was asked if they could change anything and I said no, we had a great time and everything was spot on, but in hindsight if they could change one thing, I’d have to say the Japanese toilets.  I’m not a huge fan of these and they make too much noise for my liking. That’s only a preference though, not really a problem. 

I am pretty sure we will return in the future anyway.",5,2022,06,10
141,Wonderful,"Our visit was an anniversary treat and the hotel did not disappoint. On arrival we’re greeted by the lovely Maria (who had coincidently visited our home town the previous week) ,check  in was undertaken after being offered a glass of bubbly. We were also upgraded to the Junior Suite. Following a tour of the hotel (and offered tips such as booking the spa) we were shown to our suite, sometime later a delightfully designed chocolate anniversary gift was delivered to our room. The staff were lovely, all appeared to enjoy their job. The spa is peaceful and relaxing and reasonably priced snacks. Maria was around at the time of our departure , it will be lovely to see her again, well done thank you to all the staff and an extra thank you Maria.",5,2022,06,07
141,The Londoner - Exceeding Expectations,"What a gem in London!  Having stayed in many London hotels, we chose the Londoner because of it's location.  
Stayed four nights and could not have been more impressed.  
Yes, the rooms are small, it's London!  
Everything is modern and clean, which is a London exception.  But the hotel does not have an overly modern feel.  
Service was great, concierge was fantastic.  Free breakfast was really good (except for my runny red eggs!).
Overall I cant say enough good things about this addition to the London hotel scene.",5,2022,06,06
141,A truly unique experience!,"I was welcomed by Shahin with a welcome drink and given a room with a lovely city view. Thank you Mihaela, Beatriz and Will for the attentive and efficient service. Had wonderful cocktails on the roof top with delicious Japanese food.
We enjoyed live music in the Tavern, at The Stage and at 8.
We received an unexpected beer tasting while chatting with the bartender at Joshua's Tavern. The team was always engaging and provided amazing service at all time. The Residence was a perfect place to relax at the end of the evening and enjoyed wonderful deserts.
Really enjoyed breakfast in the room an it was the right quantity and very yummy :)
Truly an unique experience in the heart of the West End. We will be back!!",5,2022,06,05
141,Great hotel,"I spent a week on my own here and thought it was brilliant. Food was very good, Service was great, room was brilliant the view from my room was amazing. Loved the gym and pool. And in a great spot as well. Don’t think I be staying anywhere else now when I stay in London",5,2022,05,27
141,Best hotel in London,"I've stayed all across London and travel often, but have never written a TripAdvisor review. The Londoner is the exception to that because the experience was truly first class—the hotel is stunning, the staff were absolutely the best, the in-room dining options were incredible, and the room was well appointed. I'll only stay at this hotel in the future.",5,2022,05,27
141,Amazing experience,"A highly recommended hotel, a perfect room. Very good breakfast. The Residence amazing space for working in a quiet place. We will surely come back here from now on and try all the amenities. The staff was very kind at the reception, really helpful and smiling.",5,2022,05,20
141,Worst stay ever with irresponsible hotel management,"We stayed in The Londoner for 3 nights. We left a very expensive watch case when we checked out. We called hotel many times.  And their receptionist and house keeping managee said will call us back asap and ended up they never call us back. we have to keep calling them and they just giving us the same excuses. One of the very rude house keep staff even told us “we never say we will call you back. We say we might only”

What a ridiculous joke. We have been to so many 5 stars hotel all over the world. This is one of the worst we have seen on how they handle the case.  Not even give us an proper answer. Disappointed with the Service! The only good thing about the hotel is the location only. The room is very small. And the water from the shower keep leaking out.",1,2022,05,17
141,It made our family celebration joyous,"Fantastic breakfasts, with a wide choice and great service (thanks Kevin).
Outstanding food for our extended family meal and amazing care from Veronica.
Lovely swims with the children at family times.
A bonus space in the Residence.
A great room.
And throughout everything the care and attention we received was never starchy and always delivered with genuine smiles.",5,2022,05,16
141,A visit to the roof bar,"Me and my 3 companions had heard about the roof bar at this newly opened hotel and decided to try it. We had booked an outside table for 5.30pm. On arrival at the lifts a lady with a clipboard said she had no knowledge of our booking and we couldn’t go up to the roof till she checked. We showed her the confirmation of the booking and instead of apologising she said she’d never heard of the name on the email. As if that was our problem… eventually we were “allowed” in the lift. 
On arriving at the bar they tried to usher us inside even though we’d booked outside. After another wrangle they eventually sat us on stools outside. Drinks were fine if very pricey but will we go back.. no.",2,2022,05,15
141,An Amazing Weekend at The Londoner,"We just spent a long weekend at The Londoner and wow, I couldn't have loved this hotel any more! The staff are amazing and so welcoming, nothing was too much trouble for them from checking us in super late after our flight was delayed to providing extra towels and slippers for us to use in the spa. 
The location in Central London is incredible, you are literally steps away from everything and the hotel facilities are fantastic, we tested the pool and spa plus several of the lounges and the Residence which is a private haven only available to hotel guests. 
Our room was gorgeous with so many additional amenities to make us feel at home including a Dyson hair dryer, robes, slippers, high-end toiletries and more. We overlooked Leicester Square and had great fun looking down on the people passing by from the comfort of our chaise longue.
The staff are so friendly, from Angel who checked us in to Kevin and Robbie who looked after us at breakfast, Veronica who was our dinner waitress and Caesar and Eliska in the Residence space. 
The hotel has a fantastic collection of artwork throughout the public spaces and in the bedrooms and don't miss the secret peepholes in the lifts, my son loved checking them all out!
My only regret is that we couldn't spend more time at the hotel, but we will most definitely be back soon!!",5,2022,05,15
141,Incredible hotel experience for our Honeymoon,"We stayed at the Londoner for our honeymoon this week. Our first time to London since the beginning of the pandemic so we chose the hotel due to location. Ideal for Soho, Covent Garden, Green Park, Mayfair, Bond Street and other London attractions.
As soon as we walked in Celia took us over to the lobby area for a coffee whilst checking us in. A great idea and something we appreciated after the journey. We were then taken to our room and given a tour of the hotel. 
Every area of the hotel is incredible. The lounges, the bars, the spa etc. However, one area that we found as a little piece of heaven was the Residence - a first class experience and tranquil area only available to hotel guests. Snacks, soft drinks and coffees are served whilst you wind down. Simply stunning and the staff were courteous, warm and helpful. 
The bedrooms are designed to perfection. The bathroom is stunning whilst we didn’t have a view the bedroom was a haven for us both. The hotel even left us a bottle to celebrate our honeymoon. Thank you ☺️
Breakfast was exceptional and not overwhelming like some hotel breakfasts who deliver vast amounts of food on a buffet station. 
No.8 at the Londoner is worth a visit for a cocktail or 2. The staff again were extremely knowledgeable, warm and friendly. Stunning views of the city at night.
Joshua’s Tavern was also a great option for a pre dinner drink or nightcap. We missed the live music sadly but believe it is terrific.
Concierge and Reception staff were lovely as well. Nothing seemed too much!
Wish we could have stayed longer and sampled the whiskey lounge… may be next time!",5,2022,05,13
141,I would have given it a 0 star if I could!,"I am an experienced traveler - spending over 100 nights a year in a hotel for the last 20 years.  I can confidently say this was the worst stay I have had in 2000 nights.   I arrived at the hotel and their system was down.  When I tried to check-in they could not check me in.  The check in manager basically shrugged his shoulders and said he was not sure when it would come back online.  No big deal - these things happen and I waited and was checked in but it was the first warning that this may not be the best hotel.  Went to my room which was nice – modern and clean.  Small room but hey its London
Went out and came back that evening (a Friday night).  That’s when the fun started.  Firstly you could hear the elevator beeping loudly in the room.  Every time someone called the elevator or got off the elevator it beeped loudly in the room (the elevator backs onto the room).  It was so loud that the first two times I went to the door thinking it was my doorbell.   In the room you could also hear loud music. I was so tired I just passed out.  Then on the following night, the music was simply unbearably loud.  There is a nightclub on the top floor of the hotel and if you have a room facing the courtyard its extremely loud in your room.  It was so loud that people I was speaking to on the phone could not hear me.  I phoned down to complain and the response got was “oh it must be louder than normal tonight as normally its only people on the 5th, 6th and 7th floor who complain a lot but you are on the 2nd floor”.  The then told me it would continue till 2am (that’s their license hours) and stop.  At 2am the music stopped but the drunken screaming from the club continued till 2:30am when I had to phone the manager who agreed to go close the club down.   When I complained about the loudness of the elevator in the room I was told by different people – “yes we know its loud in that room”.  So the hotel knowingly gives people these rooms fully aware they will not be able to sleep
I asked to change rooms and was told by multiple people they would contact me to do so and never did.  They also said they would contact me when I left given how bad my stay was and have not heard a word
Finally I also went to breakfast at the hotel and the service was so bad that they comped the meal (without me even asking) as it took 45 minutes to get toast
My advice – if you want to sleep in a nightclub this is the hotel for you.  If you want a good nights sleep – RUN a different direction.   And if they offer you room 243 (and I assume the rest of that line) you may as well sleep in Leicester Square you will get a better nights sleep",1,2022,05,10
141,The londoner review,"The hotel is very good but I don't think so the price justifies the quality of rooms it's still on expensive side.

The best thing about londoner hotel is Mr Pedro. He looked after us the whole time being from a hospitality background myself I think he is best at what he is doing definitely deserve a promotion",4,2022,05,07
141,The stage,"Amazing atmosphere, great service particularly Lucia who was attentive, very friendly and bubbly - just what’s needed for a positive experience on a night out on the booze. Will definitely visit again",5,2022,05,05
141,Great hotel in central location,Fantastic newly opened hotel. Well staffed and organised. Wide range of places to eat and drink. Rood top bar area was welcome as were the comfortable rooms with king size beds. We received an upgrade with was also a nice surprise. Highly recommended experience and in a good location towards the bottom of Leicester Sq so a little quieter (which was welcome),5,2022,05,02
141,"Stunning hotel, attentive staff and a wonderful stay","This hotel is beautiful! As you walk in the aroma in the hotel is so inviting, the staff are all very welcoming and attentive. The food in Whitcomb’s was amazing and the cocktails throughout the hotel were stunning, but I’d like to make a particular mention of the ones in The Stage Champagne Bar as they were incredible. The Maître d at The Stage also needs a special mention (unfortunately I didn’t catch his name) as he was incredibly accommodating when finding us a seat and super knowledgeable regarding the cocktails too. We were seated behind the piano, which we were happy with, but we did have empty glasses for a time. When one of our party got up to go to the bar, the Maître d saw and was straight over - which we were very pleased with. 
The rooms are also beautiful, immaculately clean and modern. 

There were two issues we encountered. Firstly, the hotel ran out of complementary water (!) which meant we had to order from the menu which was annoying and I wasn’t about to drink the tap water in the room.
Secondly, when relaxing in the spa (which is also stunning) we were awoken by another hotel guest complaining rather loudly that all the beds were reserved and there weren’t any left. I feel that this should have been dealt with in the reception area of the spa where others wouldn’t have been disturbed. The staff found her an area to sit but she was still complaining loudly which made our experience and atmosphere then feel quite negative so we decided to leave.

Aside from that I would stay here time and time again. It’s a great location too and despite these issues, I would still rate the hotel as exceptional",5,2022,05,02
141,Incredible Boutique Hotel,"Wowwee! This amazing, modern and ultra cool hotel is set right in the heart of the West End.  Easy access by underground and taxi, you can walk to all the main hot spots.

Our welcome was amazing and check-in was fast and friendly.  We were even offered a tour of the hotel (say yes as there's loads of fab little hidden gems).

Our Deluxe King room was ample for us with all the usual treats (Nespresso machine, well stocked mini bar etc) with the added bonus of a Dyson hairdryer.

Try out the loo.... I'll say no more so not to ruin the surprise.

We had drinks at the 8 bar which has amazing views and a great atmosphere.  We then headed to the Gin Bar - incredible cocktails and highly recommend.  Then we headed out into town.

Breakfast was really good, fresh and well stocked.

We didn't get to use the beautiful looking spa are as we were a bit tight on time.  What a great excuse to re visit sometime soon.

Thank you Ash, Emily, Tom and all the team for a great experience and for somehow knowing it was our wedding anniversary.  Nice touch.",5,2022,04,25
141,Wow where do you start,"We had a 4 night stay from the moment we arrived we just knew this would be good, ash meet us and sat us down and check us in, he gave us a tour of the facilities which helped because you just won’t know everything the hotel has to offer, we got to room and the wow definitely didn’t stop, what a special stay ash, the two gentlemen on the door could not of helped more, the 4 staff at Joshua’s tavern where so welcoming and knowledgeable about the bar and local history behind it, the guys in the roof top made the evening a special experience, live DJ great views of the city but we loved the outside area with the fire, food and cocktails with a spin, then during the day we used the spa twice again this is great place just to relax, we can’t thank everyone enough for a great few days, Chris & Emma T",5,2022,04,24
141,"Great room, not so great staff","The room was very nice, very comfortable and we felt really good while we were in the room. After we left the room we did not feel as good. The staff was not friendly and they gave us a certain look, like we were not worthy of staying there. I recommend the rooms but not the staff! ",3,2022,04,24
141,Outstanding,"Visited the Londoner hotel for a couple nights stay, the customer service was amazing they help me and my misses with our lounges then was welcomed with a glass of champagne at the stage, Leanne was our waitress she was amazing help us with everything we needed, and suggested some amazing cocktails, our stay at the Londoner was mind blowing and would recommend to all our friends and family the spa is to die for, 

The best part to our stay was the monopoly game in the residence where we ate a amazing steak tartar with the potato chips that was amazing tooo 

The best hotel that we’ve ever stayed in 

Thank you",5,2022,04,23
141,A lovely experience,"We were due to check in at 3pm but when we arrived earlier for our Afternoon Tea, we were advised that our room was ready if we wished to check in right away. We did so, were escorted to drop off our bags in our room with helpful information given, and came back down to enjoy our Champagne Tea. The Tea was delicious and the timing of each course just right, not too long between but certainly not rushed. We then went back to our very comfortable room.to relax before getting changed to attend The Olivier Awards. My daughter is disabled so we had an accessible room with a shower seat. The shower was powerful and worked well. The room itself was clean, well designed and there was plenty of space for the mobility aid. Everything about the hotel is beautiful and the staff welcoming and attentive without being overbearing. I loved the Stage Bar.where we had our Tea. As I first walked in I thought there was a painted ceiling (it is quite dim but works well), then I realised the ceiling is glass and the reflection of the chairs and tables gave that effect. Breakfast was varied and tasty. It was a shame we were only staying one night so did not have time to participate in all the facilities available. I hope we will have the opportunity to return and put that right.",5,2022,04,14

Very handy for the theatre being on Leicester Square. I look forward to returning some day. Life of Pi at Wyndham’s was excellent, too.",5,2022,02,19
141,Champagne cocktails,"“Popped in” for a champagne cocktail before heading off to the theatre.. loved the ambiance, atmosphere and the comfy chairs!.. champagne was delightful.. staff lovely and attentive - the the uniform dress!! … we will be back !",5,2022,02,13
141,The Smooth Operator,"An absolutely worldly hotel! As the title suggest the whole experience from check-in to check-out was smooth. Prior to arrival I received where I could check-in and also select which specific room I wanted, which was just brilliant.

We arrived at the hotel an hour early, was greeted by a friendly hotel doorman. The entry into the hotel was impressive with a piano playing, glass fire pits and a great bar-foyer buzz. The hotel staff promptly checked us in and then took us on a tour of all the hotel facilities including “the secret whiskey room”, the spa, the residents lounge where there are complimentary snacks, drinks and games and then our room.

The room was relatively small but perfectly adequate and comfortable and had great mod-cons - a light control panel on the side of the bed and in the hallway, a smart toilet with controls and heated seating, a high-powered shower cubicle, dyson hairdryer, room temperature controls via the TV and lovely Miller Harris body products. We didn’t hear any noise from our room throughout our stay and slept well.

The spa was within the basement levels and had great lounge spots around the pool with day beds and loungers. The best touch was a “detox” drinks menu that was offered poolside with a selection of great smoothies and healthy brunch options. The pool water temperature was slightly too tepid though.

The ambience of the foyer area comes alive at night with an acoustic jazz singer with piano and a lively bar.

But one of the most notable and underrated part of the whole hotel experience is the check-out time (12pm) amongst the droves of hotels reducing the check-out time to even earlier hours (9-10am) it was so refreshing and highly appreciated to be able to leisurely check-out a slower pace and enjoy the hotel in the morning. 

This was one of the best hotels we’ve stayed at in London, possibly even more enjoyable than the Corinthia. The hotel has recently opened and has truly set the bar high for hotel standards with guest enjoyment at the forefront of its values. We hope to be back very soon one day for some zen and amazing hospitality!",5,2022,02,13
141,A Jewel in the Heart of London,"A group of us stayed in the Londoner prior to the Dirty Dancing theatre show on a Saturday night.

The hotel is situated in the heart of Leicester Square amongst the hustle and bustle of the City centre which adds a touch of excitement and elegance to it's grandeur. 

We felt like celebrities as we were graciously greeted by the hostesses the moment we stepped through the door and whisked away to a seating area for a glass of Champagne and to be checked in before our bags could touch the floor. 

From the spa hidden deep below ground level to the rooftop Japanese restaurant, this place can only be described as magnificent. 

I have to admit my personal favourite space was a quaint little comfort area which offered the local papers, boardgames and refreshments however just off this room was what I can only describe as the Pièce de résistance, an elegant  little whisky room where whisky bottles of all ages adorned the showpiece cabinet. The sight was something to behold with the eye watering prices to match however.....wow.  

Upon departure for the evenings entertainment we stopped in Joshua's bar where the surroundings were plush and the service equally attentive.

I acknowledge previous comments about room size however what the rooms may lack in room space they make up for in proposition. Luxurious and elegant with every need catered for.

Alternatively you book the Penthouse with views over the London skyline and your own cocktail waiter for a mere £20k per night.

Maybe next time.

141,Fabulous luxury break,"Had a really wonderful  three days in Radisson Edwardian’s new flagship - Londoner  hotel. Perfect location in iconic Leicester Square.  From the moment the doors are opened by the welcoming concierge everything speaks stylish, modern luxury. Our room on sixth floor had everything one might want plus more (blown away by the Dyson hairdryer!) and afforded a delightful panoramic view over London; spectacular sunrises behind an illuminated London Eye. There are so many delightful unique spaces for relaxing from The Retreat - Spa pool to The Residency where soft drinks and snacks are complimentary.  The Stage, a bar with regular pianist, is an inviting space to unwind or catch up with friends while Whitcomb restaurant is fabulous for breakfast and dinner alike. Truly spoilt. Thank you Londoner.",5,2022,02,07
141,Outstanding - a new and luxurious hotel in Leicester Square with a truly unique boutique experience!,"Thank you so much to Laura and the Corporate Events Team for an amazing corporate event last month (24-27th January 2022).

We occupied their state of the art spacious meeting area on Basement 3, The National Gallery, Serpentine and Somerset House.  

From a personal experience, this hotel is hard to be beaten.  
The event food was 5* plus and my team were blown away by the standard, taste and presentation.  

The hotel is classy, elegant, immaculate and chic. The attention to detail is exemplary.  You literally receive a “sensory” experience as you enter each floor, whether its the meeting space, The Residence, The Retreat or the restaurant/bar areas.  Be sure to check out the Whiskey room!

The bedrooms are beautiful, opulent and incredibly comfortable with all the amenities you would expect from a 5* property.  And the surprise is a Dyson hair dyer in each room!

""8 at the Londoner"", their Japanese roof top bar, is a must, situated on the 8th floor, this bar is glitzy, trendy and has amazing views of London.

However, most of all, I'd like to praise the Events staff for their professionalism, friendliness, patience and attentiveness throughout our whole week.  I’ve never experienced such a team of motivated and enthusiastic individuals who have a natural desire to please and assist their clients.  

I’d like to thank all of the team, but especially Jo, Santhosh, Washi, Vahim, Peter, Ian and Ilaria for their expert assistance throughout the week.  And especially to Santhosh for his exceptional customer service (it was like having a personal butler
for the week)!

I enjoyed my week so much and I can’t wait to return!",5,2022,02,06
141,Location location location ,"Fabulous location in the heart of Leicester Square. Lovely fragrance as you walk in. Stunning interior and fabulous living flame fire awaits.

Staff slightly eager to greet and welcome you. Rooms are lovely as you'd expect from an Edwardian Hotel.

Roof top bar is slick but prices are fairly high even for the capital.

Overall lovely hotel, superb location and lovely smell. ",4,2022,02,06
141,Simply amazing!,"Had the pleasure to stay at the Londoner for my birthday and everything was perfect! The place is beautiful and very curated, a true oasis of peace in the middle of busy Leicester Square. The Spa is definitely worth a visit, as well as the lobby's bar. Service is very attentive without being intrusive, especially the kind and friendly Beatrice at reception. We also visited Joshua's Tavern, their pub, where a very knowledgeable Marco explained us the various beers on tap and the history of the painter. At breakfast, please try their pancakes, probably the best I have ever tasted! Would definitely recommend as the place to stay in London: when you go out, you are in Central London, so no need to move around with public transport! !",5,2022,02,03
141,It was okay - not worth the money,"It was okay experience, the doormen are lovely and polite but front desk staff quite stuck up and not really helpful. You can tell the hotel is new and still has teething problems. The decor and some of the facilities are beautiful! The rooms are nicely decorated but not comfortable for two people, only one chair in the room and a small sofa. Bath is so small, im 5ft and it was too small for me. The food on room service, was really over cooked and bland - considering the price, I would expect more. The breakfast wasn't great, had to ring twice as everything being sent up was wrong. Over all, wouldn't stay here again",2,2022,02,02
141,Best place to relax,"Third visit and always still amazed of this place and lovely people!!Such a lovely staff and very attentive, Mario was very kind and professional, Pedro our waiter for the night took care of me and mom and always check if everything was great and lastly Maria with her kind and positive energy makes the hotel feel like you’re home. I never had a chance to thank the chef because the food is so delicious highly recommend if you stop there you must try the food!!",5,2022,01,30
141,Go here!,"Amazing property, attention to detail and facilities. Stunning bar in reception and so many great facilities. The pub downstairs is fab, and the residents lounge was my favourite place in the hotel. 

Pool/Spa facilities are amazing too. All the staff we encountered were fantastic but a special mention to the concierge team.

Thank you for a wonderful stay!",5,2022,01,25
141,A great London hotel,"The hotel exudes charm, elegance and chic; there are a great variety of restaurants and bars, each with their own unique ambience and atmosphere.
The food and drink are excellent, and every single member of staff are unique in their highest standard of service.
Then there is the spa - a real oasis and absolutely fantastic",5,2022,01,16
141,Amazing stay ,"Everything about our stay was amazing. 

We were greeted by Julia who gave us a tour of the hotel which I would highly reccomend becuase it highlights just how fanatstic all the facilities are. 

Literally everything in the hotel is of the highest quality, the bars, the rooms, the staff...everything. 

We had some of the best cocktails at the Shima Garden bar which had a  relaxing vibe and a menu which caters for everyone.

We also made use of thespa area which is far superior to other hotels we have stayed in.

We will be back. ",5,2022,01,12
141,Pre Christmas visit,"I had initially intended to stay at the Londonder soonest after the original planned opening date but due to Covid we had to postpone at least 2 times and eventually decided to stay in December despite the actual hotel opening in September.

As I was visiting my daughter in London in September I decided to have a pre stay recky and managed to have a very enjoyable chat in the Stage/lobby over a G&T with Niall Baker the House Manager -my first impressions were very good and I was keenly looking forward to experiencing my future stay in London's new ""super boutique"" hotel:

We arrived in London a bit early to make the most of our limited time and due to the Omicron variant there had been a few cancellations so not only was our room ready but we had also been upgraded to a corner suite! As an additional welcome there was a hand written note from Niall and a G&T -much appreciated.

It's this type of personalised service that distinguishes the ordinary from the extraordinary....

Check out my room photos as a picture says a thousand words.

After quickly unpacking we headed for The Residence which is a hotel guests only lounge, it's a lovely space with board games, free soft drinks and nibbles through out the day. Service was very efficient and attentive + as our daughter had just passed her accountancy exams needless to say we celebrated with some champagne. I liked the atmosphere and in the evening it was quite full and buzzy.

The Retreat is a pool /spa area a few storeys below ground level and is a mini oasis in central London.

Whilst in the lobby/stage it was nice to be recognised by some of the staff (Gabor) and the waiting staff whose names (apologies) I forgot.

Breakfast was enjoyable but sadly it was time to leave straight after.

All in all an enjoyable but far too short a visit but we will be back for St George's Day in April!",5,2022,01,11
141,A tranquil oasis in the heart of London,"As you step away from the hustle and bustle of Leicester Square, you are immediately welcomed by the doorman as you enter into pure opulence and tranquility. This was my first stay, but my friend had stayed before (most of the staff recognised her). We were checked into our room by William, who gave us a guided tour of the hotel before being taken up to our room. We were in room 520 and had views over Leicester Square. 

As we’ve visited London many times, the purpose of our stay was to remain in the hotel. We had a glass of champagne in the stage bar, before enjoying the guest facilities, which included a lounge area with games and complimentary soft drinks. Helen made us feel so welcome. 

Tucked away behind the lounge, the hotel has a whiskey room, where you can lock away your bottle for a later date. It had the feel of a mens smoking room (without the smoking of course). 

Afterwards we headed down to the retreat and spent a couple of hours relaxing by the pool, towels are available, and water is brought to you by the staff on your arrival. The sun beds are huge and are heated. There is a hydro pool, sauna and steam room. At the time we visited the pool was very quiet with only 4 others. 

In the evening we went up to the 8 bar for drinks (reviewed separately) before returning to the stage bar where we were again welcomed by the staff, special thanks go to Emily our server. We ate our evening meal at Whitcomb’s just inside the hotel entrance (again reviewed separately).

There is nothing I can fault about this hotel, the service we received from the staff was exceptional, I’ve previously stayed at the Shangri-La at the Shard, and apart from not having the views I would definitely say this hotel is on a par if not better. We were lucky as at the time we visited the hotel did seem quiet, and at times it felt we were the only ones staying there. I would highly recommend this hotel and will definitely return in the future.

Thank you to The Londoner and staff for making my birthday one to remember.",5,2022,01,08
141,Wonderful place,"Just had a fantastic two night stay in this amazing place. The place in my opinion is stunning. We stayed in a deluxe city view room which was more than adequate & very comfortable . I loved the bathroom set up & thought the shower was lovely. We came back after a day out to find a bottle of bubbly on ice with a personal handwritten card congratulating us on our 25th wedding anniversary. It’s the little touches like this that really do make a break away special & memorable. I honestly cannot fault the place, the decor is stunning, everywhere was spotless. The staff all equally make you feel extremely welcome & nothing is too much trouble. My only disappointment is that we couldn’t stay a little longer.",5,2022,01,07
141,First class hotel and service,"I stayed in December with friends to celebrate a milestone birthday and our stay was perfection! The hotel and its amenities are beautiful and the staff were all top class! From our arrival welcoming, to arranging last minute table in rooftop bar, to the spa services, to the awesome breakfast offering we felt well and truly spoilt and would recommend anyone looking for some world class luxury! I wish I had remembered all the staffs names that made our stay extra special",5,2022,01,06
141,Superb in every way,"The whole experience from start to finish with the valet parking welcome drink check-in was amazing. We will always stay there every time we go to London the rooms are very high quality not the largest but comfortable and quality. We stayed at the Mandarin Oriental and hotels are like and this is on par.

The food is amazing cocktails exceptional and the customer service really is top-notch.

Location is excellent right on Leicester Square.",5,2022,01,04
141,Beautiful designed hotel with some service issues,"Stayed for New Years Eve, smooth and friendly check in, room was modern and perfectly clean, and despite a very large hotel, separate bars and lounges have a feel of more intimate areas. Some service issues - ordered a drink three times in the stage bar before it arrived, live entertainment in the tavern seemed to be moved at the last minute, room service breakfast never turned up despite chasing - we gave up waiting after an hour. All were resolved in a swift and friendly manner so perhaps just teething problems in a fairly new hotel. Would consider staying again but perhaps after some time to work through the service issues.",4,2022,01,01
141,Must up its game.,"First the good news .
The Hotel is in almost perfect central London location
The staff are personable and friendly.
Public areas are of great design .
Now the not so good news .
Service is slow to very slow in the bars especially the rooftop.
Breakfast restaurant is disappointingly appointed ...its soulless and poorly laid out and specified .
Breakfast itself was of average cafe standard . Presentation and service poor .Did not have full selection of cereals ,did not have decaffeinated tea as minor but important detail.
Closure of residents and main bar at 11.00 pm is poor form for a Hotel with such up market aspirations .
Room of average quality ...wardrobe space ridiculously small. Bathroom area small .
All in all a long way to go to compete with the best of the best in London.",3,2021,12,31
141,Mrs Seyhan Sharples,"We had a fantastic stay at The Londoner Hotel on the 27th Dec 2021 with my sister. It was my sister's birthday and she had a great time! She enjoyed the lovely treat; nice wine and the card from the hotel team, we really appreciated.  We enjoyed our City View Deluxe Room very much and the Retreat (Spa) facilities as well. 
We also loved the breakfast. Excellent food and service. I also would like to thank to the lovely Gentleman Kevin Habiyambere, who looked after us, for his great service. He was very kind, patience and very professional. 
The hotel staff were very welcoming and also very professional as well. We would like to thank to the whole hotel team, who helped our stay very memorable. We definitely recommend this hotel and we also would like to stay here again.",5,2021,12,28
141,Unforgettable Christmas  time,"Beautiful Hotel, we really enjoyed our stay, Aly front office manager made our stay special. Room was beautiful,  the SPA facilities are very nice and very relaxing, breakfast time delicious and the service was absolutely perfect, specially thank you to Nathaniel very attentive and courteous. Mario from the residence lounge area was very nice and looked after us.  We can’t wait to be back 🤗",5,2021,12,26
141,"Magnificent Service, Beautiful Design and…","Everything else to go with it. Really sublime service with so much attention to detail. The room was well designed with all the luxuries expected. The two things that impressed me the most was the washroom design (shower, wc etc) and the sound proofing. Located in Leicester Sq can be quite a rowdy place however we hardly heard anything!",5,2021,12,24
141,Great hotel in great location !,Loved this hotel . friendly staff..great location.. Great bar.... Definitely stay again! Hotel rooms were a little small but to be expected due to location. Check in was smooth as butter and staff could not do enough to help.  The private lounge for people staying in hotel was a hidden gem !,5,2021,12,23
141,Amazing hotel with attention to detail,"WOW! What an amazing hotel, right on Leicester Square. Amazing interiors, fantastic service and can definitely be described as Super Boutique! This was a surprise 50th stay, and we had a warm greeting from Paul who also showed us around the hotel. We cant wait to come back!",5,2021,12,23
141,Only Popped in for a Drink - Impressive!,"You can tell the quality the moment that the door is opened for you. a warm welcome from the doorman, you are swiftly introduced to a host who makes you feel at home in the superbly appointed champagne/piano bar. We sat at the bar and were served by the friendly barman. We were so impressed with the whole feel of the place, that we decided to book for dinner that evening before we returned to our own hotel and then back home to France the next day. If I had have heard of the hotel before, we would have stayed!! I have reviewed Whitcombes the restaurant separately",5,2021,12,21
141,Company Christmas Do,"Ok, so I have mixed feelings about our stay. The hotel is impressive, the guys on the door are on the ball and reception was slick. The piano lounge was a lovely touch with a relaxing atmosphere to sit and chill. The lifts are quick and efficient. The room, hmmn so for the money they are small and at first I though a bit let down. However as you spend more time in the room the quality and attention to details starts to make its impression. The room was really clean, The AC worked well, The bed and linen made for a great sleep and the shower and amenities very well appointed. Not sure about WIFI nothing was mentioned, oddly!

Break fast was our main issue, took time to lay the table, lengthy wait on toast that was cold, no milk for our tea. No sauces offered or salt or pepper. And to top it off breakfast was an additional charge of £38 ish each . The food was good quality though.

When you add the breakfast to the room, given the space its possibly a high price compared to others that give just a little less extravagance for a better deal.

The Japanese restaurant on the 8th Floor was lovely and a great experience but at £585 for the four of us may be just punching above its own status.

We did enjoy our stay, the room was comfy but for our liking just a little short of the mark for the money.",4,2021,12,20
141,Excellent,"We recently had afternoon tea here. The whole experience was excellent but the one thing that stood out amongst everything else was the friendly, attentive and fun staff. They made us feel like we were the only ones there - special shout out to Raffaella. A wonderful way to spend an afternoon!",5,2021,12,20
141,Outstanding - in every way,"We just had a night away on Friday at this incredible Hotel.
 
Greeted by the excellent General Manager Simon, we could instantly tell this is a very special venue.

The decor was modern but comfortable with an incredible ambiance - the service was impeccable from all staff - and the rooms quiet, comfortable and classy. 

I am rarely at a loss to find fault but this Hotel delivered at every turn from the welcome to the stunning bars, the reception spaces, rooms and outstanding breakfast.

The best and most individual Hotel in London - simply faultless.",5,2021,12,13
141,Great stay,"Gorgeous new hotel , very helpful concierge and super friendly staff. Really enjoyed our stay , got an upgrade , great breakfast , trendy bathrooms, clean and luxurious spa , clean stylish room and loved the supper fluffy slippers to take home !",5,2021,12,12
141,Not impressed at all,"After watching the hotels promotional video we thought we would give this new hotel a try.
What a disappointment for such a new hotel, I cant help feeling they managed to get so much wrong and in my opinion just tried to hard.
The Room: 
Dont take to many clothes with you, the wardrope was approx 1 x foot wide and couldnt handle more than 6 hangers.
You couldnt read the lighting ""push button"" board that operated the lights as the text was that small.
You had to call reception to unlock the mini bar in a £600 a night hotel ???
They had an all singing, dancing electric loo, which kept me awake for most of the night due to the sounds of the electric motors operating it.
Breakfast:
The restuarant was to full and the queue was 12 deep as we waited for a table the first morning, we missed breakfast due to this issue. They seem to prefer letting people in off the street for breakfast rather than put their residents first (very disappointing)
Bar: Last orders at the bar was 1pm for residents, we arrived from an evening out at around 12.30am to be told last orders had been called. Only when I insisted on being served and that it wasnt 1am yet did they agree to serve me.
They also tell you upon arrival they have a bar on the 8th floor that you can use and is open to residents, what they fail to tell you is you need a different key to your room key to get in there.
Could have been so much better with a little more thought !",2,2021,12,06
141,Mr Smith,"For my first review i ever done, Pedro the night concierge went above and and beyond to make me feel genuinely a Londoner guest. My first time at this hotel and this gentleman certainly is helping the hotel standards making the difference. That’s my second home away!! Will be back!!!",5,2021,12,04
141,Giorgia Caddeo,"I have booked this as a surprise for my husbands birthday and we are due to arrive tomorrow. I have had the pleasure of speaking with a lovely lady this morning. Giorgias customer service, manor and knowledge is incredible. It was an absolute pleasure speaking with you and you have made me even more excited about our visit. Thank you 😊",5,2021,12,03
141,Fantastic new addition,A stylish sanctuary in the heart of central London. Attentive yet unpretentious service and a wonderful vibe and atmosphere throughout. Beautifully designed and managed to maintain a boutique feel despite the scale. Retreat and pool were so quiet and relaxing.,5,2021,12,02
141,Extremely Helpful Reservations & Concierge Team!,"My wife and I were supposed to stay at the Londoner this week but had to reschedule our trip to London. However, I had ordered football tickets to be sent to the hotel. I reached out to the Reservations team for assistance and they were helpful to link me up with the Concierge team. 

The morning my tickets arrived, I got in touch with Ali & Emiel from the Concierge team. Emiel tracked down my tickets and helped take pictures of my football tickets, which he sent via email. Emiel then helped print the mailing labels I had purchased and dropped the tickets off at the post office to be mailed as I requested. Whenever I checked in regarding the progress of the actions, Emiel was always ready to provide an update very promptly!

Thank you Emiel and The Londoner team for saving my tickets - you guys are superstars!! I look forward to staying there when my postponed trip to London happens soon enough!",5,2021,12,01
141,Amazing staff and hotel,"The moment we stepped into the hotel entrance we were looked after. Actually before we even stepped in the hotel the door man was friendly and welcoming. 
No queueing , our bags were instantly taken and we were shown to a comfy lounge area to wait while we were checked in. 
The staff then personally took us to our room, explaining where things were in the hotel and discussed the hotel on route.  
Amazing art work everywhere , even peep holes in the lift with hidden art! 
The staff throughout our stay literally could not do anymore.  Friendly, warm , professional and full of knowledge. 
Fabulous hotel and exceptional staff. Highly recommend this hotel.
The singer in the main bar area was a delight, while we enjoyed a drink. 🥂🇬🇧",5,2021,11,22
141,The hotel and staff are amazing,"The staff at this new London hotel are a credit. Georgia called ahead of my stay to check my arrival time, plus to see if the hotel could help with  assistance on arrival. The doorman  Rado was an absolute dream, William on check in was well presented , well spoken, polite he showed us around the hotel which is superb, modern and spotless in all areas, he then took us up to the room and brought our bags up. My husband wanted an iron rather than the steamer that is in the room, and it arrived promptly. The room had everything you could need for your stay, mini bar, dyson hairdryer, complimentary water, bath room products, even mini binoculars so I could look into Leicester Square. 
Helen in the Y bar was friendly and made us beer welcome, we enjoyed complimentary soft drinks and snacks, then played a few of the games set up it the very relaxing library, with is a guest only space. 
We went to the pool and it was amazing, the pool temperature was great and with the heaters behind the sun beds it made lazing around very easy as they were extremely comfortable. 
Lots of other things were at the retreat like healthy drinks, juices plus facials, and pampering. You could definitely loose a few hours there.
The hotel was so good we decided not to leave and use the roof top bar “the 8” for a pre dinner drink,  Andre found us a great window seat with views of the eye and Big Ben, and Antonio made us feel very welcome, we couldn’t resist trying a couple of small plates to compliment the bottle of champagne we had ordered, we had a chicken dish and a ribeye beef dish with truffle it was absolutely delicious. We then moved on to the stage to while away an hour, this is by far my favourite bar with a live singer / pianist, the ambiance is great. Our waitress was Leanne, who we had met previously on her first day in the hotel she seems to have found her feet and fits in lovely, it’s so great to see staff loving there job. We had a reservation in whitcomes for dinner and had to go straight mains, as we had eaten in the 8, I had the lobster Thermidor and my partner a steak and both meals were wonderful, faultless I will eat here again during my next stay. 

Yanis,Dario, Sophia, Thomas, Chloe and Catalina  all gave us fabulous service throughout our stay. I don’t think I have ever encountered such an amazing team of staff.  
The bed was super comfortable I would go as far as to say one of the best hotel beds I’ve ever slept in. The air-conditioning was silent if you open the windows you could have the noise and the atmosphere of Leicester Square, close the windows and you didn’t hear a sound, Perfect.    
 
Breakfast in witcomes was included in my booking, with a combination of buffet style or a la carte there was definitely something for everyone, I was spoilt for choice.  
On check out Paul and Anita dealt with a small query discreetly and efficiently for me.  
We were allowed to leave our bags locked safely away in the hotel while we took of around London, when we returned to collect the doorman found us a taxi and insisted on carrying out bags. Wonderful service!",5,2021,11,16
141,"Great stay, lovely hotel.","We had booked to stay at the Raddison Blu Edwardian but after an issue with their system resulting in a double booking, we were moved to The Londoner. We were not disappointed! Great location, great staff and stunning residents bar. Our room was smaller than we’d thought but for one or two nights stay it was perfect, such a comfortable bed and amazing bathroom / shower. Unfortunately due to this being last minute, we didn’t go prepared to use the pool or spa but it looked lovely and we were surprised to hear such a central London hotel having these facilities. We were also given credit to our room for the inconvenience of being moved.",5,2021,11,14
141,WatchProLive Salon,"I attended the WatchProLive Salon event as an exhibitor at this  newly opened hotel. The hotel facilities are exceptional and the ballroom, where the event was beld, was a beautiful space with the most incredible lighting rig overhead. 

It's relatively easy to build an furnish a new hotel. However, it's the staff that transform an ordinary hotel into an exceptional destination. Throughout the show, the staff were so friendly, efficient and courteous.

In particular, I'd like to thank Santhosh Samuel and his team who looked after us so well.

Fantastic location, beautiful interiors and a hotel to keep an eye on for your next business or pleasure trip to London.",5,2021,11,14
141,A fantastic dining experience,"I was really satisfied with everything.  Good quality tasty food, a very dark and elegant atmosphere with a wonderful design, impeccable service and a wonderful staff with a lot of knowledge. I will come back for another execellent experience.",5,2021,11,09
141,Expensive for what it is and what you get. ,"I was beyond excited booking this hotel for a two night stay. Unfortunately it just didn't live up to their PR, marketing or website. I understand that the hotel is incredibly new and of course there is going to be teething issues but if you're going to open the hotel for bookings to the general population then the general staff need to know the hotel they are working for.

It felt like the staff were more interested in making sure that the very obvious influencers and press reviewers were more taken care of then the actual guests paying a very high rate.

The rooms are much, much smaller then they appear in photos. The residents areas while lovely are just okay. The hotels marketing team is obviously doing their job exceedingly well but having stayed in many a five star hotel, this one just fell short for me. 

Fabulous location (although Leicester Square itself right now is a more a construction site) and the pool is lovely but for me, the staff really fall short. While at the pool, yes someone came and gave me a glass of water and a menu but after that, I never saw anyone again to take an order?!

The staff's attention to detail and lack of knowledge of the hotel for me was a big minus. I'd wait awhile to book this hotel while they get their marketing and PR done and then let's see what the hotel is actually made of. Personally I don't think I'd be rushing back. ",3,2021,11,07
141,Lovely stay!,"Lovely hotel - facilities, rooms (and facilities in rooms) service and food (breakfast and dinner) was all absolutely amazing. Great location as walking distance to the river, Covent Garden, Oxford street. Thoroughly recommend for a weekend stay.",5,2021,11,07
141,Great decor and service,"Was happy with the entire visit. We have drinks on the roof bar and then dinner at Whitcomb's. Maria in Whitcomb's is the best and most knowledgeable staff member I have encountered. Since hospitality is struggling and I think it's reflected in most venues, it was refreshing to go somewhere and have an incredible server who knew what they were talking about and could give detailed advice on the menu. Maria is a complete super star.",5,2021,11,06
141,The Stage Bar At the Londoner,"During my time in London I visit the Londoner for a drink, my friend and I were going to see the rooftop bar but once we join the lobby we felt in love with the Stage, their champagne Bar, the Bartender Johnatan and Dario were very friendly and me and my friend felt like home, absolutelly stunning their cocktails, especially the 1729 and the Bordeaux Manhattan. Hope to visit again this lovely hotel and see this fantastic team once again.",5,2021,11,04
141,Great Venue But Needs Improvement on Knowledge of Dietary Requirements ,"This venue is in a great location and a beautiful building inside & out. The door staff were friendly and polite as were the staff inside. It is an outstanding venue for business events but was sadly let down by a lack of understanding of dietary requirements or the implications, both medically and emotionally.  It is reasonable to expect that a venue of this level should be aware about conditions such a celiac and food allergies, what this means for the person affected and the seriousness of ensuring the good is free from whatever it should be, similarly with vegetarians & vegans it should be clearly understood the difference and respect should be shown for this. As someone with medical conditions, it is an anxious time putting trust in a venue to ensure that nothing is present in my food that would make me seriously ill, so to be eye rolled when I explain that I'm not being rude but I am simply not able to eat something presented is just awful & disappointing. Please review your knowledge in this respect & relay to all staff to improve this to meet the high standards you clearly have in other aspects",2,2021,11,03
141,the best service and the kindest staff,"I stayed at the Londoner for one night in half term, and I can honestly say that the staff and team working at the Londoner were incredible. Every staff member went out of their way to ensure our comfort and happiness and in the morning everyone would wish us a good morning, a small gesture that went so so far. The facilities were incredible, particularly the spa and gym. As for the room, the views over Leicester Square and the incredible artwork and really cool Japanese toilets made my stay feel incredibly luxurious. The sustainability of the entire hotel is pioneering with water saving toilets and reusable products. The food was also incredible, dinner and breakfast at Whitcombs was delicious and was prepared very quickly to an incredibly high standard. Overall, one of the best hotels I have ever stayed in with the best, kindest staff I have ever encountered.",5,2021,10,31
141,Flawless,"We booked the Londoner as we were meeting friends for a meal in London, they were already booked elsewhere. We met at the Londoner in the bar at 8 before “going out” and suffice to say that’s also where the rest of the night continued. We loved it and the Japanese food was spectacular, we saw no point of leaving. Food, service and atmosphere all flawless. It’s fantastic. 
As an aside the rooms are amazing too, can’t wait to go back, the place oozes class and charm.",5,2021,10,31
141,Surprise Meal,"We had a surprise meal booked here for a wedding present, the food was lovely, the staff were extremely knowledgeable and had some great recommendations for food choice and broke down the menu for us.  The restaurant played very elegant back ground music and it seemed very inviting .",5,2021,10,24
141,Go now! Before prices rise and quality falls!,"The Londoner is in a pretty awful location if you’re a Londoner. But it’s worth pushing through the Leicester Square crowds to reach this urban oasis. The hotel is beautiful. Architecturally interesting, well designed and incredibly chic. The reception and restaurant staff were on amazing form - super professional while also being friendly. Food (room service dinner and breakfast) was faultless. A couple of things made me not give five stars: the spa (amazingly four floors below ground) is rather a labyrinth and difficult to navigate. You have to walk around the pool to get to the changing room. Some signage would help! The pool/spa staff were a mixed bag in terms of friendliness (different training programme from staff “above ground”?). In the room, guests should be aware that there isn’t really a bath. It’s so shallow and small that it really makes for an unpleasant experience. Great to have if you are traveling with kids but definitely not the deep, luxurious tub one expects from a 5 star hotel. I’ll definitely return - and recommend this hotel to family and friends - and just hope that the prices don’t rise and the quality fall as the hotel becomes better known and more established.",4,2021,10,21
141,The most stunning London hotel,"I cant even begin to explain how stunning this hotel is, from the small details everywhere, to the restaurants and the spa! Everything was breathtaking and a complete luxury especially as it still holds the all new feel to it. Everyone was super helpful and friendly and treated us like royalty. Would definitely recommend and will be coming back. 

There is no negatives but the only flaw the hotel has is the lack of space and storage in the bedrooms. For a weekend break it works but I would fear for people staying for longer as the wardrobe is literally tiny and considering we had the deluxe room.",5,2021,10,21
141,Beautiful New Hotel With Top Level Service …..,"I had a wonderful stay at the recently opened Londoner, it is a big budget behemoth of a place with 350 rooms set across 16 storeys, encompassing 6 restaurants & bars, a ballroom, cinema & mega spa. Despite the size it manages to feel intimate & personal & where it really excels is on service. Staff are outstanding. I was greeted & checked in by Flavia who was the epitome of polished, friendly professionalism, an absolute credit to the hotel, & this level of top drawer hospitality continued with every other staff member I encountered. The hotel is elegantly & luxuriously designed with various stunning art pieces & gorgeously curated spaces. It also smells utterly divine. At the heart of the ground floor level is The Stage, a champagne bar which serves breakfast, afternoon tea & tasty supper bites, often with live music. Whitcombs Restaurant is also at this level, open for breakfast, lunch & dinner. Food & service was excellent & I’ve reviewed Whitcombs separately as it’s well worth a visit. Perhaps the most stunning space though, is the rooftop izakaya lounge & Japanese Restaurant ‘8 at The Londoner’. Amazing views & styling, I can’t wait to return & dine there, sadly it was closed during my stay (Sundays & Mondays). In addition to these eateries the hotel offers The Residence, an intimate 3 roomed space exclusive to hotel guests. Complimentary snacks plus a light menu are available here & again service was exceptional (as were the cocktails).  I was kindly upgraded from a standard to a King size room. It was pretty diminutive, but sleek & beautifully styled with a large window & top quality fittings. The lighting system is terrific, easy to use, but enabling dim & bright settings in various areas. My bathroom was similarly dinky, but again, cleverly & expensively fashioned, including the Toto loo system. My review would have most definitely been a 5 out of 5, but unfortunately my stay was marred by intolerable noise from the next door room as my neighbours partied from 2am onwards. I tossed & seethed for a couple of hours before finally putting a call into reception around 4am. My complaint was handled well & I have nothing but praise for how the young lady on duty dealt with the issue. The loud music & thudding ceased, but I could still hear my neighbours chatter through the walls, which surprised me given the quality of construction of the hotel. Despite the super central Leicester Square location, I didn’t suffer any external noise pollution. 
Overall then, a superb stay & I would recommend The Londoner, but I would request a 
quiet room, or at least a wide berth from potential late night revellers.",4,2021,10,20
141,A special place with great staff,"Came here in September at the end of a night for a couple of drinks in the rooftop bar. Had a great time, fantastic cocktails and a stunning setting with a good DJ. The other bar in the lobby downstairs looked nice too, more relaxed, maybe for another night. The place is a bit pricey (as I guess you'd expect for a hotel on Leicester Square itself) but it's worth it for an experience that's genuinely a cut above. My main impression however was the sheer number of friendly and professional staff on hand - doubly impressive for a place that's just opened and with the post-pandemic staff shortages.

Strongly recommend the bar and looking forward to trying the hotel some day :)",5,2021,10,16
141,Most beautiful hotel lobby I seen in a while,"I have had a pleasure to visit champagne bar at the Londoner last night. 
Beautiful interior, great selection of wins, staff so friendly and professional!! Table has been touched by Mr Gabor, the manager and it made my visit even more special 😍",5,2021,10,14
141,Friendly Professional Staff with Luxurious Comfort,Staff go the extra effort to ensure you have an amazing stay! Both luxurious and comfortable they made my stay in London amazing! Raffaella the manager is amazing and she made my visit the best that it could be! Besides… they even put flowers in the cocktails on the first floor bar making you feel extra special! (And the cocktail I’ve attached was half consumed but I had to show off the flower!),5,2021,10,11
141,Wow,"I Drive a Black cab and heard of the new hotel. So on a night out thought we would pay a visit to look around. Greeted by a happy doorman who showed us in. Quickly shown to a seat and asked immediately what we like to drink. The place looks amazing and a live band was playing too. Just a great start and I hope that all goes well, definitely look to book next time we stay over. Many thanks Andy",5,2021,10,09
141,Absolutely amazing!,"Fabulous hotel, very attentive and helpful staff, amazing breakfast, new, modern and functional facilities, great swimming pool. We had an absolutely amazing time at The Londoner! There are live music at the weekend at reception and at the rooftop bar, but you cannot listen to anything from your room which is fantastic. They went beyond and above to make our stay as pleasant as possible. A special thank you to Diego, from The Residence. Hospitality needs more places like this! We are already looking forward to come back! Book it quickly.",5,2021,10,06
141,Pre stay recky,"I have been aware of the opening of the Londoner for quite some time and on paper it looks very promising so I had a reservation for the initial proposed opening but due to Covid this was understandably delayed.

I decided not to take any chances and made a booking for a future safer date that would ensure that the hotel was up and running and past it's soft opening teething problems -i.e. a pre Xmas shopping trip weekend.

As it happened I was in London for a quick birthday dinner so decided to stop by and check things out as the hotel had only recently opened.

First impressions were good so I decided to stay for a drink -the staff were all  attentive and very knowledgeable especially guiding me through the the unusual drinks menu from which I was struggling to make a decision as there were quite a few novel options to chose from.....

Not all the hotel facilities were available but I am told the roll is continuing and it should all be fully operational sometime in October.

On a whim I  asked if the GM, Charles Oak, was around and I was advised that he was busy but would try and come to say ""hello"" -sadly we did not get to meet but I hope to bump into him when I stay in December.

Looking forward to my forthcoming visit.......",4,2021,10,05
141,10/10 all around.,"We booked this hotel for the first leg of our trip as we had a last minute change to our itinerary. Main key points:
• hotel has been made perfectly. 
• room was spotless, modern and comfortable.
• pool/spa was 10/10. 
• Flavia (who I believe is guest services/manager) was incredibly helpful and kind. She really set the bar. Perfect tour and great service with a smile.
• location on leicester square was perfect.
• the hotel is very sensory-orientated. The spa focuses heavily on rejuvination also with a really cool hydration-type bar. 
• JAPANESE TOILETS. If you don't what they are..google it! 
All around, a really good hotel. We have stayed at 25+ high end hotels in central London and we are convinced this made it to the top of the list.
",5,2021,10,04
141,A truly Unique Hotel in the heart of London,"This is a Boutique Hotel on a large scale finished to a top class standard, you have probably never seen anything quite like it. The decor is artistic, beautifully presented and highly sought after. You have a variety of places to eat, drink and relax, and the food in the main restaurant""The Whitcomb's"" is of Michelin star quality; try the Risotto with truffles, heavenly! The hotel also has a warm and inviting Lounge/Bar, several other bars, a Tavern/pub and a relaxing Residence Lounge, as well as a gorgeous SPA and swimming pool. The conference facilities are second to non with a large ballroom and the use of two auditoriums. The bedrooms are comfortable, but not that big. The Service and the friendly Staff are impeccable -
I highly recommend this new ""top of the class"" hotel in our great Capital!
Toril Cook",5,2021,10,04
141,Tea at The Stage,"Warmly welcomed and looked after by Gabor. He is really lovely and kind.
Had a great time!
Will definitely re-visit again soon!
Visit was not as long as I would have liked however will be back for a full Stage experience.",5,2021,10,03
141,Caring Service,"Best service I have received in years. The Head waiter really cared about serving me with the highest standards. How he prepared every detailed, how he checked everything, how everybody around me was well served. Outstanding outstanding service. The Hostess Valeria even gave me her telephone, for a reservation and answered me at 9.00am to fulfill any of my requests. Everybody here has the right attitude. Well done to the Recruitment team! I can forget, how the grooming's were exceptional. It makes a big difference.",5,2021,10,01
141,First class stay with attentive hospitality,"My friend and I decided to stay at The Londoner on a last minute whim. We had a delicious dinner at 8 and thought it would be fun to stay overnight and try the spa. Firstly, given it was nearly midnight and we’d had a few martinis, Babu the night duty manager was fabulously attentive  and sorted us a room with a view of the London Eye. We had a list of things we needed as my mate didn't have an overnight bag (I don’t live in London so I had mine to crash at her place). Babu sorted them all including an extra duvet. The decor is spot on, Japandi with pops of muted colour. There is also a big focus on sustainability too, filtered water & recyclable bathroom products feature. The spa is lush! The refuel bar has the best morning shot menu I’ve seen for a while. Breakfast is also a welcome delight, a great bubbly team and a creative menu. Going back to 8, the rooftop bar, the service was excellent and the food was so tasty, who knew cabbage could be so more-ish. Thanks again Babu, we’ll be back soon!",5,2021,09,30
141,Miss May,The customer service at The Londoner is fantastic. Raffaella is lovely and makes customers feel very welcome. The food is also delicious. The hotel is stunning. “The Stage” is my favourite part. The decor is beautiful. Great attention to detail.,5,2021,09,29
141,Great location but some serious flaws,"Very central location, may be too central for some as during peak times you will need to get through the thronging crowds to leave the area.   Lovely building, great design and beautiful looking rooms are the plus points as well as very friendly and helpful staff.

Some serious downsides though.  Aircon in both of our rooms wasn't remotely up to keeping the room cool, even on an autumnal night.   Just a slight wispy breathe of cool air emanating from the system, and an overly warm and uncomfortable night as the windows don't open very far.   I imagine this enables them to hit some eco target, but I'd rather decide these things for myself rather than be unable to sleep in a £450+ per night room.

Baths laughably small, more of a large foot spa....literally the smallest bath I have ever seen in my life.  Even when full, you don't stand a chance of being covered by the water unless you are incredibly small, to the point they'd have been better off just putting in a better shower.  Unfortunately the decision to install such ridiculously sized baths can't be put down to a teething problem.

Bed very hard indeed...while I like a firm mattress, this was like some sort of torture implement, and I ended up not getting much sleep.

Housekeeping didn't manage to visit during my two day stay, even though I was out of the room for the whole second day.  This could be more down to teething problems, as they have only been open a couple of weeks, and most other things seem to be done with great competence, so I assume this will improve, or was just a bad couple of days.  I had to call down to get more water as they leave only two 500ml bottles, one of which was sparkling...seems a bit stingy to meet water requirements for a whole day.

So....Spa good, breakfast very good, staff great, parking very close, location is unbeatable, and room lighting control system almost perfect.  

Whitcombs restaurant, great for breakfast but I'd give it a miss for dinner as it was a pretty bad experience.

A great shame as they got most of it right, but the things they got wrong rule it out for another stay.",2,2021,09,27
141,Staycation - almost perfect,"Lovely new hotel in a central location. We stayed in a king dulexe with city view, the rooms are beautifully appointed but not increadibley spacious, it would likely feel a little cramped if you had two large suitcases. Bathrooms are lovely, with bath/shower wet-room, and Toto toilets! 

The Retreat, which is the pool area is a mini oasis in central London. The staff in the retreat were fab, special thank you to Tamara who went above and beyond.

The Residence, which is a hotel guests only lounge, is a lovely space with board games, free soft drinks and nibbles through out the day. The hotel has just opened  so is still having a few teething problems. We ordered dessert twice, once through room service which never arrived, secondly in the Residence where we had to cancel our order after waiting 30minutes.

Overall a lovely stay with a few issues, but those can be expected on opening week.",4,2021,09,19
141,New kid on the block,"I was looking forward to the opening of The Londoner due to the images I saw on social media.  Went in for a drink at The Stage bar and it did not disappoint.  The decor, the service, the drinks were all amazing.  I Will definitely go back to see it with live music and to stay there.",5,2021,09,16
141,Amazing 10/10,"Great hotel very stylish, staff are super friendly and helpful and food is great in the restaurant is just 10/10 better than most of the hotels I’ve stayed in London 

I would recommend this hotel for business or pleasure I was worried about it being to touristy! It’s not really 10/10 on everything",5,2021,09,16
141,Just gorgeous,"We went to London 5 days with the family and stayed at the Londoner, just fantastic, all impeccable cleanliness, services, rooms equipped with swimming pool and spa, relaxation room is a dizzying hotel, not to mention the staff simply lovely people... all nice people ready to help you and so I have to thank the Night Manager William Sarfo who in the middle of the night helped me and my husband to find a taxi immediately for a hospital emergency we are really grateful for the great humanity. What about everything just gorgeous.",5,2024,08,13
141,Great place !!,Excellent facilities and great location!!! We had a great weekend we hope to return soon!!! Great Expresso Martini,5,2024,04,20
141,HOLIDAY IN LONDON,"The hotel is located in a strategic and central position for visiting London on foot. Two minutes from Trafalgar Square and Piccadilly. At the reception we found Luca, an Italian boy who lives and works in London. He supported us throughout our stay, applause for his patience and super kindness: he offered us an excellent prosecco, making it available to us one evening in the bedroom and furthermore our booking did not include breakfast, instead Luca gave it to us as a gift, for the entire duration of our stay, because at the reception they had made a mistake with our payment by incorrectly charging us the cost of the stay. To apologize for the inconvenience, they gave us these very welcome gifts.
The rooms are very beautiful, with attention to detail and equipped with every comfort. The TV was also in Italian and the linen was changed every day.
The staff is attentive and very kind to customers, there is nothing I would change! I advise!",5,2024,03,27
141,Unforgettable,"5-star hotel in the centre, between Piccadilly and Trafalgar Square, reachable in less than 5 minutes. Excellent location for excursions into the city, given that Westminster Abbey and Big Ben are just over 1 km away, as are Buckingham Palace and the British Museum, a pleasant 15-minute walk along Covent Garden.
The hotel is beautiful, refined, refined in every part. The room is not very large, all in parquet, megagalactic bathroom, with toilet that recognizes your presence with infrared rays, and lifts itself (with automatic washing and drying included!!). Relaxation shower.
High-end spa with hot pool and hydromassage for moments of relaxation.
In the hotel there is also a tavern where you can taste Scottish whiskeys and a particular place where you can meet up with Londoners or hotel guests to drink something.
Very efficient, courteous, highly professional staff.
Excellent restaurant, although a little expensive; but we are in a 5 star hotel in the center of London. There is.
The Italian language is difficult to understand, but if you are lucky enough to find an Italian among the many who work in the facility, you will not have communication problems (for those who do not speak English well).
All services are excellent, and it will be my hotel when I return to London.
The only flaw, even if minimal: the cost of breakfast is 38 pounds, regardless of what you eat. You can eat an ox or a cappuccino, you will always pay 38 pounds. I asked to pay for what I consumed, impossible.
In my opinion, this should be improved, because not everyone has breakfast like Northern Europeans, but is satisfied with a coffee, a cappuccino, a croissant.",5,2024,01,28
141,Wonderful to live and enjoy London.,"Wonderful hotel, for the location, the friendliness, the services it provides and the quality in every sense. Delicious breakfast, charming staff (Marjorie, Tomas, the manager...) who resolved an incident at all times and with the best treatment, perfect facilities, great views from the room as well as from the different rooms of the hotel, perfect pool. We will surely repeat it on our next visit to London, I recommend it 100%.",5,2023,10,18
141,Excellent 5 star in central London,"Excellent hotel in an unbeatable location. From the moment one makes you feel special. Check-in is not at the traditional counter but is done in some armchairs in the lobby while they serve you a glass of sparkling wine.
The room very warm. The space is good for being London. Great bathroom with all electric toilet. Lighting system is also all electric. In my opinion, the room lacks a little light but it is a minor detail.
The hotel facilities correspond to a 5 star. Everything impeccable. The rooftop of the hotel is beautiful to have a drink.
If I go back to London I would clearly choose it",5,2023,08,17
141,Scandaloso…..borsa scomparsa,"Ladri!!! Scandaloso!!!
Sono stata derubata!!
La mia pochette di Chanel è scomparsa dalla camera e dopo discussioni con i vari manager il giorno della partenza è miracolosamente riapparsa!!! Scandaloso !!
La loro risposta??? Ohh molto strano!!! Al di là di questo assurdo ,imperdonabile, avvenimento la struttura è in una magnifica ma molto rumorosa posizione.
Struttura molto nuova ma servizio inesistente 
Le camere vengono sommariamente sistemate e depredate.Ho avuto il ferro da stiro sul tavolino 4 gg finché nn sono andata via!!!!
Il ripasso serale consiste solo nella sostituzione delle asciugamani 
Le camere piccole e la mia senza luce affacciata su una corte interna chiusa, ti svegli e nn sai se piove grandina nevica o c’è il sole sembra di stare in un alveare!!!!
Nella mia camera è presente un water toto fantastica cosa se nn facesse  continuamente sanificazione o mille rumori d’acqua giorno e notte 
La colazione veramente povera ed anche lì il servizio pessimo .
ASSOLUTAMENTE DA EVITARE .

141,OTTIMO RAPPORTO QUALITA'-PREZZO,"Per la prima volta dell'ennesima che andiamo a Londra abbiamo deciso di cambiare stuttura e siamo stati molto colpiti dal rapporto qualità/prezzo offerta dal Londoner.
Posizione TOP, non credo ci siano altre stutture di questa categoria con una poszione cosi eccezzionale. La camera di categoria superiore l'ho trovata molto carina e molto pulita, peccato però che sia anche un pò piccolina. Letto e cuscini molto comodi. Il bagno è bellissimo, doccia ampia e rilassante e Wc riscaldato e automatico.
La piscina l'abbiamo trovata invece fredda e poco pulita. Colazione meravigliosa.....CONSIGLIATO",5,2023,04,09

Pronto volveremos pero con los niños e iremos a este magnífico hotel.",5,2023,04,07
141,Camere pessime.,"L’hotel è nuovissimo e la posizione è perfetta. La colazione è ok, anche se il buffet in una struttura di questo livello dovrebbe essere più ricco e curato. Il problema vero sono le stanze. Ne ho viste 2, la mia e quella delle mie figlie ed erano quasi identiche. Ok che siamo a Londra, ma se una stanza costa più di 500€ a notte mi aspetto che sia non dico grande, ma almeno vivibile e con i servizi minimi, visto l’importo. Il bagno è minuscolo e tra l’altro ha una ventilazione forzata che non si può escludere neanche di notte (se vi piace dormire nel silenzio, non è il posto per voi). La camera ha un tavolino che è più corretto definire “mensolina”, dove non si riesce neanche a piazzare un laptop per lavorare, e infine l’armadio è in realtà una feritoia dove non si può mettere nulla! Non ci sta niente. Se stai più di una notte, letteralmente non sai dove mettere i vestiti. Ho fatto due foto perché non volevo crederci. Se fossi in un b&b da 70€ non mi lamenterei, ovviamente, ma in un hotel che costa 10 volte tanto è inaccettabile.",2,2023,03,25
141,Wer es trubelig mag!,"Zentrale Lage, sehr belebte Gegend, schlafen bei geöffnetem Fenster nicht möglich.
Empfang nett, aber oberflächlich, zum Beispiel wurden wir nicht darauf hingewiesen, dass wir als Gäste des Hotels auch den nicht empfehlenswerten Residenz Bereich nutzen dürfen, auch wenn es dort kostenlos Soft Drinks gibt. Die Zimmer sind klein und zweckmäßig, den turn down Service gab es während unseres viertägigen Aufenthalts einmal, daher war Trinkwasser immer knapp. Das Bad ist offen. Die Rooftopbar die uns beim Check in sehr ans Herz gelegt wurde verbannte uns an einen Tisch völlig ohne Blick also nicht lohnenswert, bei völlig überteuerten Getränkepreisen. Das Frühstück ist keine 39 Pfund wert.
Ich denke es gibt bessere Hotels für das Geld!",3,2023,02,25
141,Zentrale Lage aber zu teuer,"Zentrale Lage, sehr lebhaft, kleine Zimmer, sehr kleines offenes Bad, gemütliches Bett, Abendservice war bei unserem Aufenthalt von 4 Nächten genau einmal da, Frühstück viel zu teuer für das was geboten wird, beim Check in wurden wir nicht auf den Residence Bereich hingewiesen, den wir kostenlos hätten mit nutzen können, hingegen die Rooftop Bar mit super View wurde sehr angepriesen. Am Ende des ersten Abends fuhren wir dann hinauf in die Bar um dort in einem Fensterlosen Rondel abgesetzt zu werden und für viel zu viel Geld einen durchschnittlichen Wein und einen durchschnittlichen Cocktail zu trinken. Also auch nicht empfehlenswert.
Ich würde es nicht wieder buchen.",3,2023,02,22
